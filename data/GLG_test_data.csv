2018-08-29 17:38:00,2018,8.0,29,Model Rosie Mercado Found Her 'Happy Place' After Regaining 20 Lbs. During Her Divorce,"After losing over 240 lbs., Rosie Mercado was dismayed to regain 20 lbs. during her divorce. “I went back to my old habits,” the model, 38, tells PEOPLE. “I went back to feeling depressed and not taking my power back.” But over time, Mercado learned how to prioritize herself and “who I am” as a person, and came out of the experience even stronger (and dropped those 20 lbs. once again). She’s now using that knowledge to help others as one of the cohosts on the new CBS talk show Face the Truth, premiering Sept. 10, where she and other celebrity experts help real people get through difficult conflicts. “It’s about really being transformational and giving solution-driven advice that they can go home with and start implementing in their own lives,” Mercado says. “I’ve been through a divorce, I’ve dealt with a child with special needs, and with my health, and family differences. There are so many situations that I’ve gone through has made me the woman that I am, and I can tell people that they will be okay, and this is what they need to do.” Health, in particular, is something that Mercado knows well after losing over half her weight with the help of a gastric sleeve, and going through the ups and downs of weight loss. Though she had learned how to implement healthy habits before her divorce, she had to reapply them when she was focused on losing those 20 lbs. “I went through the divorce and it sucked and it hurt but I learned how to take care of me,” she says. “It taught me that life is going to happen, but you always have to stay consistent.” Now, the mom of three is eating healthy foods when she’s hungry, and avoiding the mindless snacking. She’s also working out with a personal trainer, and making a point to do fun activities that double as exercise, like dancing. “I’m going out and not celebrating over food, but celebrating over shared experience with my kids and creating memories,” she says. “I’m happy that I’m in maintenance now. Everything I gained I’ve now lost, and I’m in a really happy place. And it’s not just about physical health, it’s about mental health as well.” And Mercado is sharing her healthy habits, not just with the people on Face the Truth, but also in her own home. “My daughter is 18, and because of genetics and bad decisions and past pain, she’s dealing with being overweight. And it’s something I’m so proud of her about because she hasn’t gotten the gastric sleeve, and she’s taking control of understanding why she’s eating what she’s eating,” Mercado says. “I tell them that I’m your mom and I love you unconditionally, but what I want you to learn is that every time that you have food in front of you, you have to consider if you need the food or if you just want it.” “I’m really proud of my son because now he’ll say that he wanted ice cream but he’s not going to have it because he wants to take care of himself,” she adds. “Learning about that emotional connection with food has really changed my daughter’s life.”",https://people.com/health/model-rosie-mercado-regained-20-lbs-during-divorce/,health,People,health,539
2019-04-30 00:00:00,2019,4.0,30,US health officials urge some adults to get vaccinated against measles,"Federal health officials are urging some adults to get revaccinated against the measles amid the worst outbreak in 25 years, even though most should be protected. The measles outbreak is at its highest level in the U.S. since 1994, with 704 confirmed cases so far this year, mostly among unvaccinated children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disease is one of the most contagious in the world. Most people are vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella shot that's 97% effective when given both doses. ""Most adults are protected against measles, that's what the science says,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on a call with reporters Monday. People born before 1957 are assumed to have had the disease and therefore be immune to it. The first measles, mumps and rubella shot in 1963 was considered ineffective and replaced with a new formulation in 1968. Less than 1 million people were given the old vaccination over those five years, according to the CDC. People vaccinated between 1963 and 1989 likely received only one dose of the modern vaccine. Updated guidelines call for two doses, though the CDC says one dose is still about 93% effective. Anyone born after 1989 likely received two doses. For more on investing in health-care innovation, click here to join CNBC at our Healthy Returns Summit in New York City on May 21. The CDC says adults who are going to be in a setting with a risk of measles exposure should find out whether they were vaccinated. Examples include people who are traveling internationally, working in health care, studying at universities or living in communities where outbreaks are occurring. ""We're really urging those adults to talk to their health-care provider to make sure that they're protected against measles,"" Messonier said. ""But other adults should be reassured that the data really, really strongly supports that they are already protected against measles."" People who know they received the old vaccine should talk to their doctor about getting revaccinated with the current version, the agency says. If they aren't sure, they can ask their doctor to perform a blood test to see if they're immune or they can receive a dose of the modern vaccine, the CDC says.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/30/us-health-officials-urge-some-adults-to-get-vaccinated-against-measles.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,383
2020-01-03 00:00:00,2020,1.0,3,US on track for one of the worst flu seasons in decades," (CNN)This flu season is shaping up to be one of the worst in decades, according to the United States' top infectious disease doctor.   Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said while it's impossible to predict how the flu will play out, the season so far is on track to be as severe as the 2017-2018 flu season, which was the deadliest in more than four decades, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""The initial indicators indicate this is not going to be a good season -- this is going to be a bad season,"" Fauci said.   So far this flu season, at least 2,900 people in the US are estimated to have died of the flu, according to data released Friday by the CDC. That's 800 more deaths than estimated the previous week.   Flu cases and hospitalizations because of the flu have also risen sharply since the season began in October. CDC estimates there have been at least 6.4 million flu illnesses and 55,000 hospitalizations. Fauci said it's possible this steep rise in flu activity could reverse itself soon, in which case the season wouldn't end up being so severe.   ""Hopefully this turns around and comes down, but if it continues on the trajectory it's on, it's not going to be good,"" he said.   Fauci pointed out a CDC graph to compare the current flu season to two of the most severe in recent decades. In the graph below, designed by CNN based on the CDC data, the red line indicates flu activity from September 29 through December 28. The other lines show the 2014-2015 and 2017-2018 flu seasons, two of the worst in recent decades.   So far this season, flu activity has surpassed the peak for 2014-2015, and is climbing toward the peak for the particularly deadly 2017-2018 season.   ""We don't want it to keep going up and up and up like in 2017-2018,"" he said. ""Hopefully it won't, but if it continues to go straight up, this could really be a bad year. ""The only thing predictable about flu is that it's unpredictable."" This season so far has been particularly deadly for children, with 27 deaths reported through December 28. That's the highest number of deaths at this point in the season since the CDC started keeping track 17 years ago.    One reason flu has been so severe for children this season is that they're particularly susceptible to influenza B, this season's dominant strain. Compared with flu A, flu B is relatively stable and doesn't change as much from year to year, so many adults have immunity to it from infections earlier in life.   Even though the flu season is well underway, the worst could still be ahead, so the CDC advises everyone older than 6 months to get a flu shot.

2017-06-05 00:00:00,2017,6.0,5,"Big returns on small cancer research investment, study suggests","(Reuters Health) - A government-backed research collaboration program started in the 1950s has added about 3.34 million years of life for cancer patients in the U.S. at an estimated cost of just $125 for each year of life gained based on successful new treatment options developed through the program, a new study estimates. For the study, researchers examined data from 193 late-stage trials from the National Cancer Institute-funded SWOG research program, originally called the Southwest Oncology Group. All of these studies were done between 1962 and 2014 and were designed to prove that new treatments were better than existing therapies; 23 of them succeeded in this goal. Without SWOG, “patients would have less access to new trials, there would be slower development of new treatments, and the breadth and diversity of trials would be much more limited,” said lead study author Joseph Unger of the SWOG Statistical Center at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. “The cooperative groups conduct trials that are not strictly related to new drug development, testing such things as the effectiveness of different treatments that are already in clinical use, the combination of different therapies developed by different sponsors, therapies for rare diseases, and therapies that combine different treatment modalities such as radiation therapy in combination with chemotherapy,” Unger said by email. Taxpayers have invested an estimated $418 million in SWOG treatment trials since the program began, Unger and colleagues estimate in JAMA Oncology. This includes the cost of all trials, including tests of new treatments that prove ineffective or unsafe as well as new therapies that ultimately succeed in offering patients a better shot at survival. For the 23 successful trials, researchers calculated how many cancer patients might survive for a year who might otherwise have died without the new therapies developed through the SWOG effort. By dividing those years of life saved by the estimated cost of all SWOG studies since 1956, Unger and his colleagues calculated that it took a National Cancer Institute investment of only $125 for each year of life saved. Most of the gained years of life have come since 1990, reflecting the faster pace of new treatment discoveries in recent years. With these more recent discoveries, the SWOG trials will have added about 6.29 million years of life for all cancer patients in the U.S. by 2030 at an estimated cost of $104 for each year of life gained. These calculations are based on the assumption that practice changes were adopted by the oncology community upon publication of the SWOG findings, researchers note. Delayed adoption of new therapies developed in the trials might reduce the years of life saved. The researchers basically took survival results from SWOG trials and applied them to patients “with the same cancer at that time in the U.S. population to determine how many years of life the introduction of this new treatment into the general population with that same stage of cancer would have gained, compared to the standard treatment used before the trial results were available,” Dr. Jeffrey Abrams of the National Cancer Institute said by email. Some people have questioned whether these trials truly yield meaningful benefits for patients, and funding for this research program has progressively declined over the years, noted Dr. Ethan Basch, an oncologist at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at University of North Carolina who wasn’t involved in the study. “These days, only a limited number of these trials can be done,” Basch said by email. “This new study shows that in fact, these studies yield enormous benefits for patients.” Unger and colleagues also presented their results at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago.

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use gave a positive opinion on the drug, Kevzara, citing its ability to reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. (bit.ly/2p00FDy) Sarilumab, the active substance of Kevzara, a treatment for adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, works by blocking a protein called IL-6, which is associated with inflammation. The panel’s opinion will now be reviewed by the EMA. In October, U.S. regulators declined to approve sarilumab because of manufacturing deficiencies at a Sanofi plant in France. Regeneron said in February that it was planning to resubmit a marketing application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab. The drug has already been approved by Canadian health regulators to treat rheumatoid arthritis. More than 23 million people worldwide suffer from rheumatoid arthritis. Current treatments include the widely used methotrexate as well as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Other IL-6 inhibitors for rheumatoid arthritis include Roche Holding AG’s approved Actemra and Johnson & Johnson’s experimental sirukumab. Last Friday, the FDA declined to approve a new rheumatoid arthritis drug, Olumiant, made by Eli Lilly and Co and partner Incyte Corp.

2017-08-10 00:00:00,2017,8.0,10,The price of uncertainty could mean new double-digit health insurance rate hikes,"It is shaping up to be another year of double-digit premium increases for Obamacare health insurance plans, but this time insurers are clearly spelling out who's to blame for their sky-high 2018 rate requests. ""In most of the country, the market would be stable if not for significant uncertainty about what the (President Donald) Trump administration will do, "" said Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. The Trump administration is now holding all the cards, when it comes to making this year's open enrollment go smoothly, after Republicans in the Congress failed to pass a plan to replace Obamacare. And so far, the health department and the White House are playing it close to the vest. ""Virtually every insurer cites policy uncertainty as a factor in premium increases, and where insurers quantify the uncertainty it's often upwards of half the premium increase,"" he said. The administration countered that double-digit increases are not new when it comes to annual Obamacare premium prices, and that the problem is the Affordable Care Act itself. ""Last year alone, Obamacare premiums surged by 25 percent and 83 insurers abandoned the exchanges. Since Obamacare went into effect under the previous administration, skyrocketing healthcare costs and fewer choices have become the norm,"" said Alleigh Marré, national spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services. ""This analysis confirms what we already knew — Obamacare is flawed, failing, and harming the American people. "" Insurers still don't know whether the Trump administration will pay for cost-sharing reduction subsidies; payments which insurers are required to make under the current law to lower out-of-pocket costs for some 7 million low-cost exchange enrollees. ""I have yet to receive any answers to my questions, or indication as to when we will receive answers; which is particularly frustrating considering the Exchange is set to spend over five million dollars to lease HealthCare.gov,"" Korbulic said. Some members of the House and the Senate are pushing to pass a temporary funding bill to keep the exchanges afloat for next year, but by the time they come back from the August break it may be too late. Insurers have to submit their final rate requests next week, though they don't have to commit to signing contracts for 2018 until September 27. It's not clear if the White House has an 11th hour plan in mind to reduce the current uncertainty. ""I've given up predicting what's going to happen,"" said Levitt. ""It's hard to imagine this all getting settled within a week."" In response to questions about when states and insurers would be given more guidance about 2018 enrollment, HHS spokeswoman Marré stressed in a statement that the administration's focus is repeal. ""Inaction is not an option. The Trump Administration is committed to repealing and replacing Obamacare,"" she said, ""and will always be focused on putting patients, families, and doctors, not Washington, in charge of healthcare.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/10/the-price-of-uncertainty-could-mean-new-double-digit-health-insurance-rate-hikes.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,483

2020-02-12 00:00:00,2020,2.0,12,"Injected heroin use still near all-time highs in U.S., may explain hepatitis-C rise","(Reuters Health) - Heroin use by injection has leveled off in recent years but had been rising steadily for more than a decade, a study finds. Rates of heroin use, injection and addiction all rose steadily between 2008 and 2016, then apparently plateaued or fell slightly during subsequent years, researchers say. The trend appears to track with rising rates of hepatitis C infection and might help explain them, said study coauthor Dr. Nora Volkow. “We were intrigued by the idea that the opioid crisis might be behind the massive increase in hepatitis C,” said Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. HIV and hepatitis infections related to injection drug use have been rising for years, Volkow and colleagues note in JAMA. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data show hepatitis C infections started a sharp climb around 2010, especially among people ages 20-39. The link between hepatitis C and heroin injections would be sharing of needles and syringes by multiple people, Volkow said. A solution to the rise in hepatitis C infections would be to make sure heroin users have access to clean needles and syringes. “The problem is there are many places where access to clean syringes and needles is not available,” Volkow said. “What we’re seeing highlights the gap between what evidence-based practice tells us about how to protect against hepatitis C infection and what we are doing.” To analyze rates of injected heroin use in the U.S., Volkow and colleagues turned to the annual National Surveys on Drug Use and Health, which gather information during in-person visits. The researchers analyzed responses from 800,500 adults, average age 35, who participated in the surveys between 2002 and 2018. They found that heroin use rose by an average of 7.5% each year between 2008 and 2016, then fell 7.1% per year between 2016 and 2018. Statistics for heroin injection and addiction followed similar patterns. In some groups, however, injection rates continued to rise between 2002 and 2018. This was true for men and women overall, those ages 35 through 49, non-Hispanic whites and adults living in the northeast and west. Heroin injection plateaued among people ages 18 to 25 and those living in the midwest but still was higher in 2018 than in 2002. In 2018, reported past-year heroin injection was highest among adults in the northeast and those ages 26 through 34. There have been signs that heroin use might be plateauing or declining, said Dr. Michael Lynch, medical director of UPMC’s Pittsburgh Poison Center. In the Pittsburgh area, overdose deaths have declined by 43% compared to 2017, and national data from the CDC suggest there’s been a slight reduction in overdose deaths, he added. Still, Lynch said, “if heroin use has plateaued, it would be when we have (it) at an all-time-horrific number. That’s not a victory. At the same time, maybe we’ve at least stopped the ongoing upward trend we’ve been seeing.” The connection between injection rates and hepatitis C made sense to Dr. Michael Fingerhood, an associate professor of medicine and public health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. Fingerhood points to a study he did in the 1990s, in which 80% of heroin users who injected the drug were infected with a hepatitis virus. “A lot of people will draw blood back into the syringe to get the last bit of drug out. The virus lives outside the body for 24 to 72 hours and there can be millions of virus particles in the syringe.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2OGk62z JAMA, online February 11, 2020.",https://www.reuters.com/article/health-heroin-hepc/injected-heroin-use-still-near-all-time-highs-in-us-may-explain-hep-c-rise-idUSL1N2AC0WJ,Health News,Reuters,health,595
2018-05-10 00:00:00,2018,5.0,10,Uber expands into Spanish tourist hotspot,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Uber is expanding further into Spain by launching a multi-city ride-hailing service across the Costa del Sol beach resort hotspot before the busy summer season. Thursday’s announcement comes about two months after the U.S. company re-launched in Barcelona with a fully-licensed service after it was forced to shut down in the face of taxi driver protests three years ago. The UberX service, which uses professional drivers, will launch in the Costa del Sol on Spain’s south coast in June and cover the cities of Malaga, Torremolinos, Benalmadena, Fuengirola, Mijas and Marbella. The Spanish Costa del Sol receives about 12 million tourists every year. “With the launch of UberX in time for the busy summer season, we are thrilled to bring on-demand transportation to the Costa del Sol. We are committed to being a true partner to the cities of this famous tourist region for the long term,” a spokeswoman for Uber said. Uber is looking to make a clean break with business practices that resulted in a litany of regulatory battles, driver and consumer scandals and court cases. Its dispute with Barcelona taxi drivers over the unlicensed UberPOP service it ran until late 2014 made it all the way to the European Union’s top court which dealt the company a blow by classifying it as a transport service which could be regulated like other taxi operators. Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said in January he was focused on ""responsible growth"" as he seeks to put an end to the take-no-prisoners culture he inherited upon joining the pioneer of ride-hailing services last year. (reut.rs/2HsKVRQ) Two years ago, Uber re-introduced UberX using professional drivers in Madrid. In December 2014, a judge had ordered all Uber services to be shut down in Spain’s capital city. Decrying Uber’s return as unfair competition to their livelihoods, taxi drivers have mounted a series of 24-hour strikes in Madrid, Barcelona and other Spanish cities over the past year.

2016-03-03 00:00:00,2016,3.0,3,NY attorney general to investigate insurers over hepatitis C drugs,"(Reuters) - New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s office has asked 16 health insurers for documentation on patients who have been denied coverage of drugs used to cure hepatitis C, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. Schneiderman’s office also requested details on procedures followed by the companies to authorize the drugs used to treat hepatitis C, the person said. The Attorney General’s office has issued subpoenas to health insurers, including Aetna Inc, CareConnect and EmblemHealth Inc, the person said. The initial two subpoenas from Schneiderman’s office asked for information only about the hepatitis C drug Harvoni, while the remaining subpoenas didn’t specify any particular drug, the person familiar with the matter said. Gilead Sciences Inc, with its two blockbuster drugs Harvoni and Sovaldi, has dominated the market for hepatitis C, which affects about 185 million people worldwide. Harvoni’s total sales were $13.86 billion in 2015. In January, Massachusetts’ attorney general asked the biotechnology company to reconsider its pricing for Sovaldi and Harvoni. Last year, the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging kicked off a series of hearings designed to investigate the causes behind drastic drug price increases.

In fact, in the last four decades, the couple has adopted 88 children, when all of them were infants.  ""The children I took in were expected to die,"" Geraldi, 68, told CNN. ""But so many of them have lived."" Her family includes kids with intellectual disabilities, spina bifida and Down syndrome. Some have autism or extreme facial deformities.  ""One child was born with only a brain stem,"" she said. ""We took care of him. He lived to be 25 years old and never had a bedsore."" Labor of love The labor of love started in Florida even before Geraldi, a nurse, met her husband Mike, a pediatrician, at a Miami hospital. She had already taken in three kids while single.  ""When Mike asked me to marry him, I told him I want to make a home for handicapped kids, and he said 'I want to follow your dream.'""  Along with huge hearts, they had fortitude -- and that sustained them through the years as they coped with the deaths of 32 children.  Creating normalcy Geraldi makes sure the kids know they have to do chores. It's all part of creating a normal home environment for them.  ""The children know what pair of underwear belongs to what child,"" she said. ""We want them to be as independent as they can be."" Their oldest adopted child, Darlene, is now 32. She lives in a Florida group home.  The youngest, Isabella, is 8. Born to a cocaine addict, the girl was deaf and blind as an infant. Today, she is performing a year above her grade level in school.  Then there are the couple's two biological daughters.  One of them, Jacqueline, was born premature. Doctors said she had severe brain damage.  Today, Jacqueline is 40, a nurse practitioner and a mother.  The other was born without any disabilities. Nature's cruel hand The Geraldis never had time to rest, and Mother Nature didn't make it easy. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew flattened their household. The kids were okay, but the family had to relocate to some cabins husband, Mike, owned along with several other doctors in Murphy, North Carolina.  In 2011, while the family was away on a camping trip, lightning struck their homestead. The fire destroyed everything: the house, vehicles, their sense of security.  The couple scrambled to get a new home for the family. They found one in Ellijay, Georgia.  Through it all, they kept adopting more special needs infants. Some children died. Some grew up. Some of the young adults stayed at the house. Others moved away.  About three years after the fire, the Geraldis finally took a brief trip to Orlando.  ""A vacation with a child is not a vacation. It's called a 'trip,'"" quipped Camille.  But the trip was cut short. Geraldi's husband looked sick.  The kids kept vigil around his bed as he died of cancer early last year.  Geraldi stayed strong. ""I couldn't cry or my children would've fallen apart.""  No regrets Today, the family is still strong. Funds are tight. The family relies on money raised by the Possible Dream Foundation to cover basic needs and pay two employees that augment a team of volunteers.  A close friend recently pried Geraldi away from the house for a seven-day cruise.  ""I got on the boat, and I virtually slept for seven days,"" she said. ""I didn't realize how tired I was."" Tired, but still spirited.  ",https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/23/health/iyw-couple-adopts-88-terminal-infants-trnd/index.html,health,CNN,health,624
2016-09-15 06:02:07,2016,9.0,15,Diabetes and Your Diet: The Low-Carb Debate,"A few years ago, Richard Kahn, the now-retired chief scientific and medical officer of the American Diabetes Association, was charged with organizing a committee to prescribe a diet plan for people with diabetes. He began by looking at the evidence for different diets, asking which, if any, best controlled diabetes. “When you look at the literature, whoa is it weak. It is so weak,” Dr. Kahn said in a recent interview. Studies tended to be short term, diets unsustainable, differences among them clinically insignificant. The only thing that really seemed to help people with diabetes was weight loss — and for weight loss, there is no magic diet. But people want diet advice, Dr. Kahn reasoned, and the association really should say something about diets. So it, like the National Institutes of Health, went with the Department of Agriculture’s food pyramid. Why? “It’s a diet for all America,” Dr. Kahn said. “It has lots of fruits and vegetables and a reasonable amount of fat.” That advice, though, recently came under attack in a New York Times commentary written by Sarah Hallberg, an osteopath at a weight loss clinic in Indiana, and Osama Hamdy, the medical director of the obesity weight loss program at the Joslin Diabetes Center at Harvard Medical School. There is a diet that helps with diabetes, the two doctors said: one that restricts — or, according to Dr. Hallberg, severely restricts — carbohydrates. “If the goal is to get patients off their medications, including insulin, and resolve rather than just control their diabetes, significant carb restriction is by far the best nutrition plan,” Dr. Hallberg said in an email. “This would include elimination of grains, potatoes and sugars and all processed foods. There is a significant and ever growing body of literature that supports this method.” She is in private practice at Indiana University Health Arnett Hospital and is medical director of a start-up developing nutrition-based medical interventions. But there are no large and rigorous studies showing that low-carbohydrate diets offer an advantage, and, in fact, there is not even a consensus on the definition of a low-carbohydrate diet — it can vary from doctor to doctor. “There have been debates for literally the whole history of diabetes about which kind of diet is best,” said Dr. C. Ronald Kahn, chief academic officer at Joslin, and no relation to Dr. Richard Kahn. But, he said, “the answer isn’t so straightforward.” In support of a diet like Dr. Hallberg’s, there is one recent short-term study, by Kevin Hall of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and his colleagues, involving 17 overweight and obese men, none of whom had diabetes. They stayed in a clinical center where they ate carefully controlled diets. The researchers asked what would happen if calories were kept constant but the carbohydrate composition of a diet varied from high to very low. The answer was that insulin secretion dropped 50 percent with the very low carbohydrate diet, meaning that much less insulin was required to maintain normal blood glucose levels. “Since diabetes results when the body can’t produce enough insulin, perhaps it is a good idea to reduce the amount of insulin it needs by eating very-low-carbohydrate diets,” Dr. Hall said. Some longer-term studies, though, failed to show that low-carbohydrate diets benefited glucose control. Even if diets are effective in the short term, Dr. Hall said, “the difficulty is adhering to the diet over the long term.” In an analysis of weight loss diets (not specifically for diabetics) published this summer, he and Yoni Freedhoff of the University of Ottawa wrote: “Diet adherence is so challenging that it is poor even in short-term studies where all food is provided. When diets are prescribed, adherence is likely to diminish over the long term despite self-reports to the contrary.” But short-term studies of just a few weeks, which constitute the bulk of the diet studies, can be misleading, said Dr. C. Ronald Kahn. “In the short term, the low-carbohydrate diet sometimes does better on glycemic control,” he said. “But as time progresses, the difference mostly disappears. What counts is which diet helps most with long-term weight loss. ” The reason the advantage sometimes seen with a low-carbohydrate diet tends to vanish, Dr. C. Ronald Kahn added, is probably a mix of people failing to adhere to the diets and their bodies’ adjusting to them. Another issue with low-carbohydrate diets, researchers said, is the question of what will happen to overall health if diabetics actually follow the diet for years or decades. (Heart attacks are the major killer of people with diabetes.) Insulin levels may be better, but, said Dr. Rudolph Leibel, a director of Columbia University’s Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, “effects of a low-carbohydrate diet on lipoproteins and vascular biology could offset such a ‘benefit.’” In other words, it is not clear if a lower insulin level would translate into fewer heart attacks. Dr. Hamdy, whose recommended low-carbohydrate diet is less restrictive than the one Dr. Hallberg suggests, reports that many patients in his clinic have been able to stay with the diet for as long as five years, losing weight and keeping it off. He presented his study at the 2015 annual conference of the American Diabetes Association and has submitted it for publication. It involved 129 patients. Half were able to lose weight and keep it off, and those who did maintained an average weight loss of 9.5 percent. Their diabetes was much improved. It is impossible, Dr. Hamdy said, to separate weight loss from the diet’s effects on diabetes because people following such a diet — which limits but does not forbid things like breads, pasta and rice — also lose weight. But multiple studies have found that when it comes to weight loss — the only proven way to help with blood sugar control over the long term — there is no difference among diets that restrict calories, fat or carbohydrates. Experts like Dr. David Nathan, the director of the diabetes center and clinical research center at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, advise dieting for people with diabetes. But, he said, “when we advise people to be on diets, the major goal is to lose weight.” What matters the most for controlling diabetes, Dr. Nathan said, “is how much weight you lose.” Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article erroneously included a link to a research study in The Lancet. The linked study reported that low-carb interventions led to “a slight but significant, greater long-term weight loss than did low-fat interventions” in the setting of weight loss trials; it did not report that all diets had the same results.

2019-03-28 00:00:00,2019,3.0,28,Huawei: UK issues new security warnings,"London (CNN Business)UK officials have delivered a harsh rebuke to Chinese tech giant Huawei by raising new concerns over its engineering work and questioning the company's commitment to security. The Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre, which monitors the company's activities in the United Kingdom, said it has identified another round of ""significant technical issues"" with Huawei's engineering. In its annual report, the watchdog also said that Huawei has failed to address security issues raised last year, leading it to provide ""only limited assurance"" that risks from Huawei equipment already deployed in Britain can be managed. It states that it would be ""difficult"" to manage risks from future Huawei product deployments unless the company's software engineering and cyber security processes are fixed. The report, which includes input from UK intelligence agencies, could make it more difficult for Huawei to convince the UK government and mobile operators that its products should be used in new superfast 5G networks. Huawei has pushed back hard against repeated US claims that using its telecommunications equipment exposes countries to potential spying by the Chinese government.  The company denies the accusations, and has called on the Trump administration to provide evidence to back up the allegations. It has challenged a ban on federal agencies buying its products in US court.  Huawei, which is the world's largest supplier of telecoms equipment, said Thursday that it has already launched a $2 billion program aimed at resolving the security issues raised by the United Kingdom.  ""We understand these concerns and take them very seriously,"" a Huawei spokesperson said.  The UK watchdog said its report that the security issues raised are about ""basic engineering competence"" and ""cyber security hygiene,"" and could be exploited by any number of actors.  It said it does not believe the defects identified ""are a result of Chinese state interference."" It also said that Huawei must do more to resolve the issues. The watchdog said it ""has not yet seen anything to give it confidence in Huawei's capacity to successfully complete"" its transformation program. Even more problematic for the Chinese company are concerns raised by the UK watchdog over its commitment to security.  The panel cites security commitments first made by Huawei in 2012 — and later repeated — that it said the company has not followed through on. ""Strongly worded commitments from Huawei in the past have not brought about any discernible improvements,"" the watchdog said. The report could influence a separate UK government review of telecoms equipment suppliers being carried out as mobile providers prepare to build next generation 5G networks. BT (BT) said in December that it would not buy Huawei equipment for the core of its 5G network. Vodafone (VOD) said Thursday it had taken note of the report and welcomed government efforts to ""understand and manage"" risks. The European Union asked its member states earlier this week to conduct 5G risk assessments, acknowledging there were concerns over Huawei. It stopped short, however, of the blanket ban sought by the United States. ",https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/28/tech/huawei-uk-security/index.html,tech,CNN,technology,499
2020-01-08 00:00:00,2020,1.0,8,Genetic markers not very good for predicting disease risk,"(Reuters Health) - Many people worry about inheriting health problems from their parents, but a new approach to analyzing genetic contributions to disease risk suggests that for most diseases, commercial DNA tests are not the best way to assess the odds. For the study, researchers analyzed data from almost 600 earlier studies that found associations between common variations in the DNA sequence, known as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and more than 200 medical conditions. Usually, genetics explained no more than 5%-10% of the risk for several common ailments including certain cancers, diabetes and Alzheimer’s. “Most common, chronic diseases have little to do with genetics or to do with your parents or the genes you inherited from them,” said senior study author David Wishart, a researcher at the University of Alberta in Canada. “If you are worried about developing a disease, genetic testing won’t tell you much - unless you have a strong family history of a certain disease (multiple parents, siblings, aunts and uncles are afflicted),” Wishart said in an email. The study found some exceptions, where genetics clearly do play a more powerful role, accounting for up to about half of the risk for diseases like Crohn’s, celiac and macular degeneration, Wishart noted. “Despite these rare exceptions, it is becoming increasingly clear that the risks for getting most diseases arise from your metabolism, your environment, your lifestyle, or your exposure to various kinds of nutrients, chemicals, bacteria, or viruses,” Wishart said. For decades, scientists have studied how genes might help predict disease risk, Wishart’s team notes in PLoS ONE. Many of these older studies focused on how diseases developed in identical and non-identical twins, and estimated that genetics might explain up to 80%-90% of the risk for many common conditions. More recently, however, scientists started looking at this question differently, scanning the entire genomes of thousands or millions of people. Many such studies identify SNPs that appear to be associated with a small amount of increased risk for a particular illness. But they don’t determine whether or how that variant directly influences the disease, and often the effect of any one marker is very small. For the current study, the researchers developed a computer program to measure the performance of SNPs or combinations of SNPs in predicting risk for diseases. Then they ran the program using data from previous whole-genome studies. “What we found was quite shocking,” Wishart said. “Based on our results, more than 95% of diseases or disease risks (including Alzheimer’s disease, autism, asthma, juvenile diabetes, psoriasis, etc.) could NOT be predicted accurately from SNPs.” When they used the SNP data to calculate the risk of developing certain conditions that a parent had, the “heritable” risk was again very small. “The heritability of most diseases derived from SNPs was typically less than 5% (not 80%-90%),” Wishart said. In most cases, other kinds of tests - such as blood tests for proteins or other molecules involved in metabolism or in specific diseases - offer a much more reliable picture of disease processes and risk than pricey consumer DNA tests do, the study team concludes. One important caveat and open question is the role of environmental and lifestyle factors in magnifying genetic risk, Wishart noted. Even when people have a very small genetic risk for a disease, certain lifestyle habits like smoking or inactivity or environmental factors like pollution exposure can exacerbate the risk.

2016-05-18 20:52:11,2016,5.0,18,"H.I.V. Rates Among Gay Men Are Higher in South, Study Finds","More than a quarter of gay and bisexual men in some cities and states in the South are living with H.I.V., according to a new study — a far higher rate than in the country as a whole. The study shows how much more common H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, is among gay black men, especially in the South, as well as how little is being done to prevent its spread in a group whose members face discrimination and are less likely to have medical insurance. Gay men with insurance are more likely to be in treatment if they are infected or to be using pre-exposure prophylaxis if they are not, both of which significantly cut the chances that an infection will be passed on. “There are just not enough services,” said Dr. Ronald O. Valdiserri, an AIDS expert at the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. “It’s not just medical care — it’s housing, employment, vocational rehabilitation and transportation,” Dr. Valdiserri said. “These individuals are fairly vulnerable, and there aren’t enough assets to cope with their illness.” The study, by epidemiologists at Emory University in Atlanta, was published online Tuesday in a relatively obscure outlet, The Journal of Medical Internet Research: Public Health and Surveillance. But it was accompanied by a second editorial by top AIDS specialists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In South Carolina and Mississippi, the study estimated, 28 percent of gay and bisexual men are infected with H.I.V. In Louisiana, the estimated infection rate is 26 percent, and in Georgia, 25 percent. In Washington, D.C., which resembles a city more than a state in its demographics, it was even higher, 32 percent. The lowest estimated infection rate was in South Dakota, where less than 4 percent of gay and bisexual men are infected. Among states that have particularly large gay populations, California’s estimated infection rate is 17 percent, Florida’s 18 percent and New York’s 20 percent. The trend was even more pronounced in cities. Researchers counted only men who had received an H.I.V. diagnosis (the statewide figures relied on estimates), and consulted previous data on how much of each city’s population was gay and sexually active. Then the researchers calculated which 25 cities had the highest infection rates among those men. In Jackson, Miss., that figure was 39 percent; in Columbia, S.C., 30 percent; in El Paso, almost 29 percent; and in Augusta, Ga., 27 percent. Twenty-one of the top 25 cities were in the South. The lowest rate, just under 13 percent, was found in the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim metropolitan area. Nationwide, the report said, about 11 percent of gay and bisexual men have an H.I.V. diagnosis. “We hope these data empower local public health officials, community-based organizations and everyone fighting H.I.V. to bring resources to the gay and bisexual men who need them the most,” said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of the C.D.C.’s National Center for H.I.V./AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, S.T.D. and TB Prevention.

2016-11-10 00:00:00,2016,11.0,10,Libraries can be a health lifeline for people most at risk,"(Reuters Health) - Public libraries can provide vital support for people at high risk for health problems such as new immigrants and people dealing with homelessness, mental illness and substance use, say U.S. researchers. Their analysis of Philadelphia libraries and how communities use them concludes that libraries can offer specific programs that directly and indirectly improve health, such as classes to improve skills or literacy. Librarians can also act as support figures, connecting people with resources for basic needs like housing. “Some people would argue that libraries are old-fashioned, outmoded institutions that are irrelevant in the digital age,” said senior study author Carolyn Cannuscio, a social epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, in email to Reuters Health. “Our work shows very clearly that libraries are vital, dynamic organizations that know their patrons well and respond creatively to community needs.” Cannuscio is also head of the Healthy Library Initiative, a partnership between U. Penn and the Free Library of Philadelphia, which has 54 locations around the city. To explore how libraries can contribute to community health, the study team interviewed staffers at Philadelphia Free Library branches about the programs they offered and who used them. They also interviewed 77 residents around library locations to determine the most pressing needs in the community and how the library could help. Relevant programs offered by the libraries included classes on nutrition, youth leadership, obtaining housing, job training, literacy and support for the elderly. Overall, in 2015, the Free Library locations across Philadelphia received 5.8 million in-person visits. Half a million of these visits were from people participating in specialized programs or classes designed to improve social factors that affect health. The library staff and the residents agreed that people at greatest risk for health issues were those experiencing homelessness, mental illness and substance use issues, in addition to recent immigrants and children and families suffering from trauma. Librarians reported spending significant time helping to find treatment centers for people with mental health or substance use issues. Substance use was common in the city communities and librarians even had to help people who were immediately at risk for drug overdose. The library also functioned as a physical shelter for homeless people. In addition, librarians helped residents complete housing applications and sort through legal challenges with landlords. Recent immigrants frequently used library resources for a broad range of needs. Librarians helped them navigate social services, download and fill out forms related to getting insurance and healthcare or apply for jobs, communicate with lawyers, landlords, and schools and apply for citizenship. Libraries also offered safe spaces for traumatized children and families, who were often witnesses of neighborhood violence. Libraries are trusted places in communities and offer free access that may be more welcoming than other agencies, the Healthy Library Initiative researchers write in the journal Health Affairs. Librarians said that they found themselves acting as social workers but did not have the training they need for this role, the researchers note. Libraries may be just as vital in rural areas as in cities, said Ellen Rubenstein, a professor of library and information studies at the University of Oklahoma who was not involved in the study. “In addition to spotty internet coverage in many rural areas, some of the same issues exist as in urban settings: poverty, lack of resources, and the need to support the elderly,” Rubenstein said by email. “Libraries function as the heart of their communities,” Rubenstein said. “They serve as valuable community centers that bring together diverse groups of people and enrich lives every day.” “In contemporary life, libraries serve some of our country’s most basic needs,” Cannuscio said. “Where else can people of all ages, races, ethnicities, and needs come together to share in the rewards of social engagement and lifelong learning - and all for free?” SOURCE: bit.ly/2eNiCk7 Health Affairs, November 2016.",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-libraries-community-idUSKBN1352OD,Health News,Reuters,health,642
2018-03-13 00:00:00,2018,3.0,13,What is 5G?,"President Donald Trump has blocked a proposed Broadcom acquisition of Qualcomm over national concerns, with some analysts saying it would theoretically lessen investment in 5G development. A major concern about the deal is it could diminish Qualcomm's position, leaving room for Chinese company Huawei to take over as a major telecommunications infrastructure provider in the U.S. The treasury Department said in a letter last week it considered Huawei a threat to the development of 5G, while Qualcomm was ""well-known and trusted by the U.S. government."" So what's all the fuss over? What exactly is 5G, and why should we care? Cell phones first started out on an analog network that allowed people to communicate using brick-like mobile phones. The standards evolved to 2G, which allowed for digital service and expanded voice communication. 3G allowed for the use of data, letting us connect to the internet with our phones. 4G's main innovation was speed, allowing people to access data about 10 times faster than 3G. 5G would improve wireless networks in several areas: ""It's not really made so your videos are going to stream better on Facebook,"" said Gartner principal research analyst Bill Menezes. ""But to be able to stream television in addition to internet access, in that respect you'll need 5G — especially to stream 4K ultra-high-definition television."" ""It could enable the 'tactile internet,' where the latency is so short when you are doing something you are filling the other end because the feedback is so quick,"" Gartner research vice president Mark Hung said. It's important to note the 5G standards being proposed are theoretical and may not live up to these promises. ""This is all in writing until it is formally ratified, based on physics,"" Menezes said. ""Physics says if you design it this way you'll have that theoretical performance."" Case in point: The 4G network has a top speed of 300 megabits per second, but you'll probably only get that speed if you're right next to a cell tower and the only device on it, Menezes explained. Current average speeds in the U.S. are around 40 to 50 megabits per second, Hung said. 5G could potentially hit 1 gigabit per second, but probably will be only around 10 times faster than our current speeds. ""In the real world, you've got interference and things that weaken the system,"" Menezes said. ""It can fall way below that theoretical limit."" We're also a few years away from a full-fledged 5G network. The standards are on pace to be ratified by 2020, Menezes said. AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile are doing field testing in limited areas right now, but widespread 5G networks in the U.S. probably won't be ready until 2022 to 2023, he added. But if you're curious about what 5G could mean, South Korea is testing out its 5G network during the upcoming Winter Olympics. The demos will probably just show off basic connected cars and 4K TV live streaming in a small area rather than its full capabilities, Menezes pointed out.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/29/what-is-5g.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,501
2019-07-08 17:21:00,2019,7.0,8,Model Bridget Malcolm Marks 2 Years of Eating Disorder Recovery,"Victoria’s Secret model Bridget Malcolm is making significant progress in her recovery from a longtime eating disorder, but it takes constant work, she emphasized in a new blog post. The Australian model, 27, reflected on the last two years that she has spent in recovery from severe anorexia, which have been filled with ups and downs. Malcolm said that she “must never forget” that she is in recovery. “I am not cured,” she said. “And I have to exert fairly constant vigilance on myself, to make sure that I don’t slip back into old habits.” Malcolm said that at the moment, she is dealing with intense body dysmorphia. “My body dysmorphia is particularly bad right now,” she said. “There is no reason why — I have not gained weight, and I have not lost weight. For some reason though, the feeling of my skin is making me extremely uncomfortable. I would love nothing more than to reduce the size of the human I see in the mirror. And I know that if I do, I endanger my life and everything in it.” She said that while her body dysmorphia is difficult to deal with mentally right now, she knows it will pass, and that it can’t destroy her the way that her anorexia could have if she hadn’t stopped it. “That does not mean that it will be bad in one hour, one day or even one month,” she said. “Everything changes, and discomfort now can mean happiness and strength tomorrow. However, what I do know to be true is that starving myself, ends in a lot of pain for myself and those around me. I know it, because I have lived it. It is a slow and gradual decline, but it is a decline. There is too much possibility in my life these days for me to give in to those old, mean voices.” And Malcolm said that those voices help to keep her in check. “Whilst the voices never go away, they certainly fade,” she said. “They become a background noise that is easier to drown out. And in a way, I found them extremely beneficial. In the past two years, whenever those voices have gone away, I suddenly realize that I have stopped eating. I gave in. And I had to start again with feeding myself. Sitting with them, and looking them in the face has been a treasure trove of insight.” Malcolm said that today, she “will continue to commit to my three meals a day,” work out to build strength, not to lose weight, avoid mirrors and focus on her relationships. “Because that is all I can really do right now,” she continued. “I am not the result of one massive lifestyle change. I am a culmination of every little action I do throughout the day. Living in recovery is extremely challenging. Sometimes the only thing I am capable of is thinking one step ahead. If I get too caught up in my future, I lose my grip on the present.” “So today, try doing the small things that bring you back to center. It is all about progress over perfection after all.”",https://people.com/health/victorias-secret-model-bridget-malcolm-2-years-eating-disorder-recovery/,health,People,health,528
2017-01-11 00:00:00,2017,1.0,11,"EU privacy proposal could dent Facebook, Gmail ad revenue","Online messaging services such as WhatsApp, iMessage and Gmail will face tougher rules on how they can track users under a proposal presented by the European Union executive on Tuesday which could hurt companies reliant on advertising. The web companies would have to guarantee the confidentiality of their customers' conversations and get their consent before tracking them online to target them with personalized advertisements. For example, email services such as Gmail and Hotmail will not be able to scan customers' emails to serve them with targeted advertisements without getting their explicit agreement. Most free online services rely on advertising to fund themselves. Spending on online advertising in 2015 was 36.4 billion euros, according to the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB). The proposal by the European Commission extends some rules that now apply to telecom operators to web companies offering calls and messages using the internet, known as ""Over-The-Top"" (OTT) services, and seeks to close a perceived regulatory gap between the telecoms industry and mainly U.S. Internet giants such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft. It would allow telecoms companies to use customer metadata, such as the duration and location of calls, as well as content to provide additional services and so make more money, although the telecoms lobby group ETNO said they remain more constrained than their tech competitors. The proposal will also require web browsers to ask users upon installation whether they want to allow websites to place cookies on their browsers to deliver personalized advertisements. A previous version of the proposal would have forced browsers to set the default settings as not allowing cookies which are the small files placed on people's computers when they visit a website containing information about their browsing activity. ""It's up to our people to say yes or no,"" said Andrus Ansip, Commission vice-president for the digital single market. Online advertisers say such rules would undermine many websites' ability to fund themselves and keep offering free services. ""It will particularly hit those companies that ... find it most difficult to talk directly to end users and what I mean by that is tech companies that operate in the background and sort of facilitate the buying and selling of advertising rather than the ones that the user directly engages with,"" said Yves Schwarzbart, head of policy and regulatory affairs at the IAB. But the CEO of advertising tech company Appnext, whose revenues come entirely from advertising spending, said the new rules would bring clarity and would not have a significant impact on business models or revenue. ""There is no doubt that it is time for the entire ecosystem to become more transparent and fair to all of the stakeholders. Users want easy access to trustworthy sources of information while feeling safe with the data they share,"" Elad Natanson said. Companies falling foul of the new law will face fines of up to 4.0 percent of their global turnover, in line with a separate data protection law set to enter into force in 2018. The proposal will need to be approved by the European Parliament and member states before becoming law.

The delivery forecast, higher by more than a third than last year’s production, suggests Tesla is looking at a steadier chapter after years of steep losses, production troubles and clashes between chief executive Elon Musk and U.S. regulators. The electric carmaker’s stock, which has nearly doubled in the past year, jumped 13% after hours on Wednesday, cracking the $600 mark for the first time. Tesla said that the manufacturing process at its new Shanghai factory, which started delivering Model 3 sedans a month ago, was running as expected and that it would increase production of the mass-market cars because of strong demand in China. The $2 billion Shanghai factory is key to Tesla’s growth strategy. There it aims to produce 150,000 Model 3 sedans and later increase output to 250,000 a year, including the Model Y. But the company warned of a 1-1.5 week delay in the ramp of Shanghai-built Model 3 cars because China ordered a shutdown of the factory after a new coronavirus breakout that has killed 170 people and infected thousands. “This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter but is limited as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in the early stages,” Tesla’s chief financial officer Zachary Kirkhorn said on a post-earnings call. The company is evaluating whether it will be hurt by the virus and whether the supply chain for cars built in its Fremont, California plant will be affected, he said. Tesla said it started production of the new electric crossover utility vehicle Model Y at the Fremont factory this month and plans to deliver the first cars by the end of March, ahead of schedule. Tesla already starting Model Y production was the most notable item in the release, Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin wrote in a note. “For a company that has always been late, this is a big improvement,” he said. Tesla initially did not expect to make the Model Y until late 2020 and then moved up the forecast to this summer, finally beating that deadline by several months. The results indicate that Tesla is controlling costs better, a metric that investors have questioned Musk on before and that he was quick to talk about on the call. “In 2019, we managed to generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while building parts of Model Y production,” he said. Tesla’s cash balance increased to $6.3 billion and total operating expenses rose less than 1% to $1.03 billion in the December quarter. And while its revenue per unit delivered rose by only 3% in the fourth quarter, operating profits per vehicle rose by roughly 19%. (Graphic: here) Tesla, which last week overtook Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) as the second-most valuable carmaker behind Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), still trails luxury carmaker rivals on steady profits per vehicle, a key metric. (Graphic: here) Some analysts have questioned the more than $104 billion valuation, but investors are betting that Tesla has overcome its many struggles and can compete with larger, better capitalized rivals to lead the industry in technological innovation for next-generation cars. The company’s debt pile is high as well, amounting to $13.42 billion at the end of 2019. Tesla reported a 4.9% operating margin in the fourth quarter and said Model Y production and the Shanghai factory ramp-up were likely to weigh on margins temporarily. Its new initiatives, which also include the construction of its first European factory in Germany, an electric pickup truck, a new generation of the Tesla Roadster and automated driving features, are also likely to put a strain on its cash pile. Net income attributable to common shareholders fell to $105 million, or 56 cents per share, for the three months ended Dec. 31, from $140 million, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $7.38 billion from $7.23 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $7.02 billion.

2016-09-19 19:10:00,2016,9.0,19,"A Human Body Has Been Found in this Famous 2,100-Year-Old Shipwreck","Divers have discovered an exceptionally well-preserved human skeleton buried within the 2,100-year-old shipwreck that produced the Antikythera mechanism, considered the oldest analogue computer, according to new research published in Nature on Monday.  The Antikythera shipwreck is a 40-meter-long Roman merchant vessel that sank sometime in the first century BCE, around the reign of Julius Caesar. Archeologists think it was destroyed after a brutal collision with the cliffs of the Greek island of Antikythera after which it is named. ""We think it was such a violent wrecking event,"" said underwater archaeologist Brendan Foley, co-director of the Antikythera excavation team, in Nature. ""People got trapped below decks."" After the ship's debris field was found in 1900 at a depth of 180 feet, the wreck quickly gained fame for its bounty of luxury goods, likely intended for wealthy Roman buyers.  Though numerous artifacts have been removed from the site since its discovery, the most sensational find was the seemingly anachronistic clockwork mechanism, considered the most technologically advanced device to have survived from classical antiquity. The ancient Greek timekeeper contains dozens of bronze gears designed to track the cycles of the Sun, Moon, select planets, solar eclipses, and even the Olympic Games. Contemporary excavations into the seabed beneath the site have continued to yield new finds. On August 31, just weeks ago, researchers happened upon the watery grave of one of the shipwreck's ill-fated victims.  The recovery of human remains from an ancient underwater wreck is exceptionally rare. Most bodies are consumed by ocean life or washed away by currents long before researchers have the opportunity to obtain them.  But because this person was buried under about a half-meter (1.6 feet) of broken pottery and sand deposits, much of the skeleton remained intact, including two arm bones, two femurs, several ribs, and a partial skull with teeth.  ""We're thrilled,"" said Foley. ""We don't know of anything else like it."" If the team is able to successfully extract DNA from the bones, it will mark the first time an ancient shipwreck casualty has been genetically sequenced. Though human remains were previously recovered from the Antikythera shipwreck in 1976—by Jacques Cousteau, no less—those samples were treated with chemicals for preservation or otherwise contaminated, making them poor candidates for DNA analysis. (Because DNA sequencing is a relatively new technology, earlier excavators often did not preserve samples in optimal condition for it.) Based on the size of the femurs, the team speculates that the doomed passenger was likely male. At the time of this reporting, the researchers are waiting for the official greenlight from Greek authorities to attempt DNA extraction, because it was found in Greek waters. Genetic sequencing could result in a wealth of information, including confirmation of the sex, and insights into the subject's ancestry and physical appearance.  ""Who were those people who crossed the Mediterranean 2,000 years ago?"" Hannes Schroeder, an ancient-DNA analyst from the Natural History Museum of Denmark, told Nature. ""Maybe one of them was the astronomer who owned the mechanism."" For now, the researchers have nicknamed the body ""Pamphilos,"" after a name etched into a wine glass recovered from the shipwreck. It seems fitting that even in Roman times, people felt the need to label their drinkware.

2020-01-29 00:00:00,2020,1.0,29,Airbnb backs creation of EU digital regulator after court win,"LONDON (Reuters) - Short-term home rental company Airbnb said on Wednesday it backed calls for a European Union digital regulator after winning a landmark EU case that meant it would be classified as an online platform rather than a property agent. It said the body should form part of discussions around the EU’s proposed Digital Services Act which aims to upgrade safety rules for digital platforms, services and products. The company won its battle to remain exempt from onerous European property regulations in a landmark ruling last month of the EU’s Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Airbnb Inc’s rapid growth over the last decade has posed a challenge for traditional hoteliers, and authorities in cities from New York to Amsterdam, Berlin and Paris have accused the company of worsening housing shortages and pushing out lower-income residents. Airbnb says that the company, cities and its hosts and customers can all benefit from better regulation of the sector. “While our thinking on this topic is still in its early stages ... we are clear that we support calls for a single European oversight body for digital services,” said Chris Lehane, Airbnb Senior Vice President of Global Policy and Communications. “We strongly believe that housing policy and regulations of short-term rentals within that does need to take place at the local level,” Lehane added at a briefing in London. Writing to European cities to announce its backing for an EU digital regulator, Lehane said that such a body could ensure regulation of the sector was trusted, consistent and could mediate in any disputes that arise. Lehane also said it would announce a partnership to give cities independently published data on the impact of short-term rentals in Europe, and wanted to work on improved ways for collecting tourist taxes from guests. On a global level, Airbnb said last year it would introduce new safety measures in response to a fatal Halloween shooting in California, including a ban on so-called “party houses”, a 24/7 hot-line and a review of “high risk reservations.” Reporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Stephen Addison",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-airbnb/airbnb-backs-creation-of-eu-digital-regulator-after-court-win-idUSKBN1ZS1IB,Technology News,Reuters,technology,348
2016-12-16 16:30:02,2016,12.0,16,"In Shadow of Amazon, European Challenger Looks to China for Inspiration","BERLIN — Robert Gentz stepped off an Air Berlin plane in Beijing with the goal of conquering online fashion in China. By the time he boarded his return flight to Berlin, he had a new plan: to copy it. Mr. Gentz, a 34-year-old German who is a co-founder of Zalando — a European clone of Zappos, the online American shoes and fashion retailer owned by Amazon — held meetings in the fall of 2013 with Chinese and international fashion labels, online stores and other parts of the local e-commerce industry. He wanted to expand his company into the world’s largest digital market. But after the meetings, Mr. Gentz decided China’s approach to online fashion was far ahead of anything available elsewhere. He marveled at how Chinese consumers freely chatted with — and bought from — brands and stylists on WeChat, a local internet messenger, while online retailers, independent delivery companies and fashion houses routinely joined forces. “We wanted to take that experience back to Europe,” Mr. Gentz said. This holiday season, Zalando, which is Europe’s biggest digital fashion player, is using a made-in-China approach to take on Amazon, just as the American giant is looking to cement its place as the world’s dominant e-commerce company by expanding aggressively into the Continent’s still-fragmented world of digital fashion. Few companies have been able to keep Amazon — the largest online fashion seller in the United States — at bay after it enters a new market. The notable exception is in China, where rivals like Alibaba, the world’s second-largest online seller by market value, have been able to hold their ground. For decades, tech companies have taken their cues from Silicon Valley. But Zalando’s approach of borrowing from its Chinese counterparts represents a new strategy of looking East, not West, for inspiration. In overhauling its successful European online fashion store into a digital platform, Zalando differs from others trying to match Amazon and its logistics and technological prowess. The German company previously focused on handling all sales and inventory itself. But in addition to selling directly to consumers, it now wants to remake itself into a digital shopping mall, allowing fashion houses and retailers to make sales as well, often with limited input from Zalando. These efforts, roughly a year in the making, may foster a rare European tech player able to give Silicon Valley heavy-hitters a run for their money across the region, still one of the world’s largest — and most profitable — markets. “If you want to be the dominant player in a geographical area, you need to go beyond being just a traditional e-commerce player,” said Erik Mitteregger, a board member at Kinnevik, a Swedish investment firm that was an early Zalando investor and still owns a 32 percent stake. “It’s a necessary move.” Zalando’s inspiration from China, though, comes with challenges. Despite domestic dominance, Chinese players like Alibaba have yet to successfully replicate their business model overseas. Online shopping habits in Europe also are somewhat different from those in China. And Amazon and European competitors, including ASOS and Yoox Net-a-Porter, may yet outmuscle Zalando with their traditional takes on e-commerce. For most Americans — and even some Europeans outside its core German-speaking markets — Zalando is not a household name. It began in 2008 as a Berlin start-up founded by Mr. Gentz and David Schneider, two business school graduates who once tried — and failed — to build a Latin American rival to Facebook. By 2014, Zalando had become the largest public offering in the European tech sector since 2000. It counts Rocket Internet, a Berlin incubator known for copying successful online business ideas, and DST Global, a backer of Facebook, Twitter and Alibaba, among its early investors. To meet the needs of Europe’s national markets, Zalando has tweaked its offerings. In Germany, where few people use credit cards, consumers can pay with an online service linked to their bank accounts after receiving clothes in the mail. In Italy, it worked with a local delivery company so people wary of goods not arriving could pay in cash upon receipt of their orders. While European competitors have also earned loyal followings, Zalando remains the largest, both by market valuation and total online sales, according to Euromonitor, a data provider. It is expected to double its yearly pretax earnings this year, to $220 million, and revenue is likely to jump more than 20 percent, to $4 billion, according to an average of equity analysts’ estimates. “Zalando is well placed to be a leading fashion platform in Europe,” said Andrea Ferraz, a Morgan Stanley analyst in London. Still, the company remains a relative minnow — its $9.5 billion valuation is one-fortieth that of Amazon. And Europe’s fast-growing online fashion market, estimated to be worth $75 billion, has not gone unnoticed by e-commerce giants. Alibaba has hired local country managers and brought its payment service to Europe, mostly to serve Chinese visitors. Amazon has opened a fashion studio in London and joined the British Fashion Council to bolster its local credibility. To compete with Amazon and others, Zalando has spent heavily on a network of logistics hubs that dot the European landscape. On the outskirts of Erfurt, a sleepy German town, orange boxes filled with designer dresses and shoes scuttled along miles of conveyor belts, while workers on push-scooters sped through Zalando’s first custom-built logistics warehouse, now the size of 18 football fields. Four more — from Italy to Germany — are up and running, and new sites are planned outside Paris and, potentially, near London. And just like Amazon, the company has been accused of mistreating some of its workers, complaints Zalando executives acknowledge they could have handled better. As part of its overhaul, Mr. Gentz gathered his management team soon after Zalando’s I.P.O. in 2014, outlining the steps needed to become a digital hub for all things fashion. For one, it is combining its logistical expertise with that of big brands and mom and pop stores all over Europe. The goal, executives say, is to use Zalando’s website and smartphone application as a platform to sell goods either from its warehouses or directly from fashion houses themselves, giving customers greater choice and flexibility. Adidas, for instance, allows people to buy its items through Zalando’s platform, even though the final sale may come directly from the German sports brand’s stock (Zalando takes a commission). The relationship now includes same-day deliveries — the fastest, in Berlin, took just 24 minutes — from some of Adidas’s German stores. “No one else offers this level of partnership,” said Roland Auschel, Adidas’s head of global sales, who first discussed stronger ties with Zalando during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The e-commerce company has also offered up its in-house advertising team. That includes testing an online marketplace where Zalando connects fashion houses with “online influencers,” or personalities with large social media followings. For Nicolas Borg, a Zalando strategy executive who previously worked at eBay, the next stage will most likely be chatbots, or humanlike interactions powered by artificial intelligence, to offer fashion advice to consumers on the likes of Facebook Messenger. “In the future, what will matter is not where the purchase happens, but how you can influence it,” Mr. Borg said. “That is our biggest challenge,” he added. “How do we change the online experience?”",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/16/technology/amazon-zalando-eu-online-shopping.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,1221
2018-02-27 00:00:00,2018,2.0,27,Uber CEO says Brazil investment hinges on regulations: paper,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc’s [UBER.UL] level of investment in Brazil will depend on how regulations evolve, but the ride-hailing firm is more dedicated to the market than its main rivals, Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi told a newspaper. Khosrowshahi defended regulations governing ride-hailing apps approved by the Brazilian Senate in October in an interview published on Tuesday in Folha de São Paulo, and stressed the importance of the bill passing in a workable form in the country’s lower house. “To the extent that it’s possible, we’re going to continue investing in Brazil. The investment level, obviously, will depend on that regulation,” he said. “The text that the Senate sent to the lower house reflects the appropriate balance.” The unmodified rules would have required all drivers to be registered with their local municipalities, creating bureaucratic hurdles, the company said. Brazil is Uber’s second biggest market, but the app has had to lobby the country’s legislators hard to avoid crippling regulations. In late October, the Senate passed amended rules, after Uber said the original version of a bill governing the apps would have jeopardized the future of the company there. In January, Uber competitor Didi Chuxing of China agreed to acquire control of Brazilian ride-hailing app 99, potentially creating a formidable rival to Uber in Brazil. In the interview, Khosrowshahi said Uber was the company most dedicated to the national market. “We respect 99 and Didi’s investment, their competitive position, but I don’t think that they have been as dedicated to Brazil for as much time as us,” he said.

For comparison, non-connected electric Sonicare and Oral-B toothbrushes cost anywhere from $25 to $190.

2018-11-26 15:00:00,2018,11.0,26,HIV-Positive Inmate Spent a Year in Solitary for Having Consensual Sex,"The other man was given a slap on the wrist, his privileges revoked for 30 days. Dorn, who is HIV positive, was thrown in solitary confinement for a year. “I was told by several prison officials that I was being treated differently because of my HIV status,” Dorn says. Prison officials at Michigan Department of Corrections were operating under a policy which required indefinite isolation of HIV positive inmates who have sex in prison. Chris Gautz, spokesperson for Michigan Department of Corrections, said that it's possible officers were explaining the Department’s policy to Dorn, but ""it's not something that would have been said out of malice or spite."" Dorn was locked in his cell for 23 hours per day, unable to communicate with his elderly mother. (Phone privileges were revoked except for “verified family emergencies,” according to a subsequent lawsuit.) Worse, he feared that his new situation meant he had lost his opportunity to meet with the parole board and petition for his timely release. “I felt helpless and [was] treated unfairly,” Dorn says. He says that, in solitary, he became distraught and suicidal. He passed the time by writing letters to groups like the ACLU, arguing that his punishment was unethical, even illegal. Dorn’s situation eventually came to the attention of lawyers at Michigan Protection and Advocacy Service and Lambda Legal, a civil rights group focusing on LGBTQ and HIV positive people, who advocated on his behalf. He was released in October 2014, celebrating his 44th birthday as a free man. A few months later, he sued Michigan Department of Corrections. Dorn and his lawyers argued that the prison’s policy violated a federal law called the Rehabilitation Act, which outlines civil rights for prisoners with disabilities. In November 2018, Michigan Department of Corrections agreed to a settlement in which neither party admitted to any wrongdoing. More from Tonic: Dorn’s lawyers called the settlement a “victory” because the prison system agreed to update its policy to conform with federal law and award Dorn $150,000. The updated policy reflects a modern understanding of the science of HIV transmission. “Previously under the policy, there was a presumption that the prisoner could transmit the virus,” says Chris Gautz, public information officer at Michigan Department of Corrections. In the early days of the AIDS epidemic, many people worried that HIV could be passed through casual contact like kissing or shaking hands. Now experts agree HIV can only be passed via blood contact or sex. Scientists have also since developed powerful drug cocktails in the form of antivirals that are capable of suppressing the virus enough to not transmit. In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said these drugs are so powerful that it would be nearly impossible for people like Dorn, who was taking daily HIV medication, to transmit the virus to anyone else. Michigan’s new policy will punish HIV positive inmates caught breaking the rules on a case-by case basis with the input of at least two medical professionals to determine the real risk of infection. Prisoners with HIV will not be automatically sent to solitary confinement. In fact, Gautz says two prisoners were removed from segregation (also known as solitary confinement) in the wake of this policy change. “We are pleased with the outcome of the case,” he says. These so-called “HIV criminalization” laws vary, but many punish things like spitting, biting, and other behaviors that “pose a low or negligible risk for HIV transmission,” according to the CDC. Groups like Lambda Legal and the ACLU are fighting to have them removed, arguing they’re rooted in outdated science. “Even though state law has not caught up,” Gautz says, “we wanted to be as progressive as possible with our policies and make sure they’re in full accordance with federal law as well.” According to Dorn’s lawyer, Richard Saenz, who works for Lambda Legal, there’s a long history of discriminating against people with HIV in prison. Scientists discovered the virus that causes AIDS in 1983. By 1984, nearly all state prison systems were quarantining people with HIV, operating under the assumption that the virus could be spread through casual contact. That assumption turned out to be an over-reaction. Slowly, over the following two decades, HIV positive prisoners were integrated into the general prison population. In 2012, South Carolina became the last state to abandon its policy of systematically segregating people with HIV. Today’s HIV-specific policies are more nuanced, calling for harsher punishment of HIV positive people rather than automatic quarantine. The idea is that for people with HIV, their bodily fluid constitutes a deadly weapon, so actions like sex and assault should carry a heavier penalty. Saenz and others argue these policies violate civil rights. His firm, Lambda Legal, is currently reviewing other state prison systems to identify policies akin to Michigan Department of Corrections’ prior rule. “With this settlement, we hope that [other states] take the affirmative step of changing them, like Michigan has done,” Saenz says. According Melissa Badowski, a pharmacist who treats HIV positive inmates in Illinois, it’s unfair to tack on extra punishment for HIV positive prisoners. “So you’re saying somebody with HIV should never get into a fight because there might be blood, and now there’s malicious intent?” she says, rhetorically. “I don’t think that’s appropriate.” When Dorn was in solitary confinement, he continued to receive his HIV medication throughout his confinement, but says that the circumstances made it difficult to have honest conversations—about his health or anything else—with the prison’s medical staff. “Any time you come out of your cell you’re in handcuffs, shackles, and bell and chains,” he says. “You’re escorted by two officers, one on either side of you, holding a short tether referred to as a leash—and they have tasers.” These officers stayed in the room during Dorn’s medical appointments, he says. “That stifled what I felt like I was my ability to communicate freely with my doctor at the time,” he says. But prisoners with HIV face other challenges. Chiefly, HIV is highly stigmatized in prison, with many inmates associating HIV with homosexuality or injection drug use. Corrections officers might use a prisoner’s HIV status against them, threatening to ‘out’ them as a means of coercion. Dorn says that Michigan corrections officers ‘outed’ his HIV status routinely. And while Gautz insists that Michigan corrections officers “would not have access to a prisoner’s medical file,” Dorn tells me that “there are no secrets in prison” and that corrections officers told fellow inmates about his status at the various prisons he was housed. While a concrete answer to what actually happened is not currently evident, Badowski says that her patients in Illinois—who include HIV positive inmates—have told her similar stories (to Dorn’s) about corrections officers, though she’s never witnessed such behavior firsthand. Though some people would have tried to put aside memories of solitary confinement, Dorn decided to keep advocating against the policy that landed him in a segregated cell—a process that ultimately took four years. He’s glad he persisted. “I wanted to see it through, he says. “I didn’t want this to ever happen to someone else.” Today, Dorn lives in Atlanta, where he runs a landscaping business and volunteers to help support at-risk kids in his community. Though “bittersweet,” Dorn hopes this settlement will ease stigma against people with HIV. “People with HIV are not pariahs—they’re just like anyone else with any type of chronic medical condition,” he says. “The medicine today allows anyone with HIV to live long healthy lives. We’re no different than anyone else.” Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of Tonic delivered to your inbox.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9k4aey/hiv-criminalization-prison,Health,Vice,health,1269

The next day, the senior at John Glenn High School in Westland, Michigan, was suspended. ""I was called to the office and told by one of the assistant principals that an administrator found a photo of the girl's bathroom on social media and that I'd be issued a three-day out-of-school suspension for 'inappropriate use of electronics,'"" Hazel told CNN.  The school, like many around the nation, has a rule that prohibits the use of cell phones inside restrooms to respect the privacy of others. But parents and students were outraged. They thought the school ought to be more concerned about the water than the phone rule.  In response, dozens of students posted pictures taken of themselves in the school bathroom. When Wayne-Westland Community Schools superintendent, Dr. Michele Harmala, got wind of the uproar, she expunged the suspension from Hazel's record.  The rule, she told CNN affiliate WXYZ, was designed to protect inappropriate photos of students; not maintenance issues. She also discovered the school hadn't reported the water issue.  ""I reached out to them. They sent a plumber out right away,"" Harmala said. ""We had a pipe that reached the faucet that was corroding and needs to be replaced and that's underway right now.""

2016-06-28 00:00:00,2016,6.0,28,Gilead wins U.S. nod for drug for all types of hepatitis C,"(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Tuesday approved a combination drug by Gilead Sciences Inc that is the first available treatment for all six major forms of hepatitis C, advancing the company’s leadership in the field and sending its shares up more than 4 percent. Gilead said in a separate statement that it priced the drug at $74,760 for a 12-week regimen. Gilead has dominated the hepatitis C market over rivals AbbVie and Merck & Co with its high-priced and highly effective treatments Sovaldi and the combination drug Harvoni. The new treatment, to be sold under the brand name Epclusa, combines Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), which was approved in 2013, with a new anti-viral drug velpatasvir. Epclusa costs less than the $84,000 that Sovaldi sold for when it launched in late 2013. Gilead now offers discounts and rebates on that older drug, which was at the center of a national uproar over soaring drug costs. Epclusa is approved for patients with and without cirrhosis, a form of scarring seen in patients with advanced disease that can lead to liver failure and need for a transplant. For those with moderate to severe cirrhosis, Epclusa must be taken with the older drug ribavirin, the Food and Drug Administration said. “This approval offers a management and treatment option for a wider scope of patients with chronic hepatitis C,” Edward Cox, director of the FDA’s Office of Antimicrobial Products, said in a statement. While the majority of U.S. patients have the genotype 1 form of hepatitis C, about 20 percent to 25 percent have genotypes 2 or 3, with small numbers infected with genotypes 4, 5 or 6. In other parts of the world, other genotypes are far more prevalent, such as in Egypt, where genotype 4 is widespread. In pivotal clinical trials, Epclusa led to cure rates of 95 percent to 99 percent in patients without or with mild cirrhosis after 12 weeks of treatment. In a separate trial of patients with moderate to severe cirrhosis, cure rates of 94 percent were seen. In afternoon trading, Gilead shares were up $3.35, or 4.28 percent at $81.60 on Nasdaq.

Telus, which has been attracting more postpaid wireless customers amid heightened competition, said it would invest more than C$900 million this year alone in Alberta. The company is in a heated battle with Shaw Communications Inc, which has recently beefed up its high-speed internet and cable TV products. The strong growth for both major Western Canadian companies comes as Alberta recovers from an economic slowdown caused by a prolonged slump in oil prices from late 2014 though early 2016. Telus said last week it would invest C$4.7 billion in a similar push in British Columbia.

2019-03-28 00:00:00,2019,3.0,28,"Huawei equipment poses 'significant' security risks, UK says","The U.K. government warned on Thursday Huawei's telecommunications equipment raises ""significant"" security issues, posing a possible setback to the Chinese tech firm as it looks to build out 5G networks. In 46-page report evaluating Huawei's security risks, British officials stopped short of calling for a ban of Huawei's 5G telecommunications equipment. But the assessment cited ""underlying defects"" in the company's software engineering and cybersecurity processes, citing ""significantly increased risk to U.K. operators."" The findings give weight to warnings from U.S. officials who have argued Huawei's networking equipment could be used for espionage by the Chinese government. Huawei has repeatedly said it does not pose any risk and insists it would not share customer data with Beijing. In a statement Thursday, Huawei said it takes the U.K. government's findings ""very seriously."" ""The issues identified in the OB (oversight board) report provide vital input for the ongoing transformation of our software engineering capabilities,"" a Huawei spokesperson said. The U.K. government report rebuked Huawei for failing to address security concerns raised in previous assessments, saying the Chinese firm has not taken steps to address underlying defects in its software engineering. The report was conducted by the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre Oversight Board, a watchdog set up in 2010 to monitor Huawei's security risks. ""The Oversight Board can only provide limited assurance that all risks to U.K. national security from Huawei's involvement in the U.K.'s critical networks can be sufficiently mitigated long term,"" it concluded. Huawei is the world's biggest telecommunications equipment maker and has been under intense scrutiny for its role in building out 5G networks around the world. 5G is a fifth-generation wireless network that promises faster speeds and lower latency, increasing download speeds for consumers and potentially transforming industries like the internet of things and self-driving cars. The U.S. and China are racing to implement 5G technology, and American intelligence officials have urged allies to boycott Huawei from providing infrastructure for the new networks citing security risks. The U.S. has also accused Huawei of violating American sanctions on Iran and stealing trade secrets, which the company also denies. Experts have been skeptical about Huawei's assurances that it isn't a security risk, pointing to Chinese laws that allegedly mean every domestic company is legally mandated to assist the country in intelligence gathering if Beijing requests it. The new U.K. government said it ""does not believe that the defects identified are a result of Chinese state interference."" Instead, it blamed ""poor software engineering"" and a lack of ""cybersecurity hygiene."" In other words, Huawei's networks could be exploited by a ""range of actors,"" not just the Chinese government. Last year, Australia banned Huawei and ZTE from selling 5G equipment in the country, while other countries are weighing similar measures. In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the decision was based on ""hedging against future risks"" on the high-speed networks. So far European countries have not heeded Washington's request to outright ban Huawei. This week the European Commission said EU countries will be required to share data on 5G security risks but did not single out concerns about Huawei. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said earlier this month the country would set its own security standards on the new networks. Telecommunications operators like Britain's Vodafone have warned excluding Huawei could slow down the rollout of 5G. The British firm relies on Huawei to supply equipment in many of its networks.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/28/huawei-equipment-poses-significant-security-risks-uk-says.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,572
2017-04-13 00:00:00,2017,4.0,13,"Liberal U.S. lawyers, states mull legal fight over Obamacare","WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - To stop President Donald Trump from undermining Obamacare, Democratic Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey is considering an approach that has worked against the administration on immigration: using Trump’s own words against him. Trump said he would let the Affordable Care Act “explode” after Republicans failed last month to pass their own repeal bill in Congress, and told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that he may withhold billions of dollars of payments to insurers to force Democrats to negotiate on healthcare. Public statements like that led to judges blocking Trump’s proposed travel bans earlier this year, and could prove to be one line of attack in legal attempts to protect the healthcare bill, according to a handful of liberal U.S. lawyers and state attorneys general. They said they are waiting to see what action the administration ultimately takes on the healthcare law before they will officially respond. Democratic attorneys general took a lead role to successfully block Trump’s executive orders restricting travel from some Muslim-majority countries, and are also resisting efforts to roll back environmental regulations. Now, the threat of potential litigation over the healthcare law from states, which takes a page from the Republicans’ playbook during the Obama administration, is complicating the Trump administration’s efforts to formulate its own approach on health policy outside congressional legislation, according to two conservative lobbyists briefed on internal discussions. The White House maintains that the healthcare law is “already collapsing on its own, and will continue to go in the wrong direction as more Americans face skyrocketing premiums, higher deductibles, and less choice,” an administration spokesman told Reuters. “President Trump and his administration are committed to working with Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare.” Noting that several federal judges cited Trump’s comments on Muslims to support the idea that his executive orders unconstitutionally targeted a religious group, Massachusetts AG Healey said Trump is legally bound to enforce the ACA. But his words make it clear he is willing to sabotage it, in her view. “He is intent on setting the dynamite and blowing this up,” Healey told Reuters. She said it is too early to speculate about specific legal action but said Trump’s remarks about the law “suggest he is out there not just hoping that it fails but working to see it fail.” In addition to Healey, Democratic attorneys general for California, Connecticut and the District of Columbia told Reuters they are closely monitoring the administration for any signs it is undermining the ACA. The California attorney general’s office recently hired a health policy expert, Melanie Fontes Rainer, who worked for Democrats in the U.S. Senate. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement his office is “leaning forward when it comes to protecting our people’s right to affordable, quality health care.” Four private lawyers in Washington D.C. said they have discussed possible challenges among themselves and potential clients who have benefited from the law. One such legal challenge being discussed is suing the Trump administration for failing to abide by the “take care clause,” which requires that the president faithfully execute laws enacted by Congress, according to Deepak Gupta, a Washington lawyer who often works on public interest cases.    “That the president is operating in good faith … is pretty critical to how the law works. That good faith is legitimately in question,” he said. Texas and other states that challenged Obama’s executive action seeking to prevent immigrants from being deported cited the take care clause in their lawsuit, claiming he was failing to enforce immigration law. Obamacare, former President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement, enabled 20 million Americans to gain health insurance. The new administration could effectively cripple Obamacare with a pending Republican lawsuit over cost-sharing subsidies that was appealed by the Obama administration and put on hold when Trump took office. Trump said he may withhold the payments, which help cover out-of-pocket medical costs for low-income people, that Republicans argue must be appropriated by Congress. Proponents of Obamacare say that not funding the subsidies, which amount to about $7 billion a year, would torpedo the law because it would cause insurers to flee the individual market and could leave millions of people without a place to purchase insurance. But the administration must weigh whether to fund the subsidies at the risk of being viewed as helping the law succeed, or be blamed - and possibly sued by attorneys general - for the law’s demise, according to the lobbyists, who have been briefed on internal discussions. “There’s a concern that liberal attorneys general would file suits,” one lobbyist said. “This is a playbook that Republicans wrote during the Obama administration.” In some respects, the Trump administration has already taken steps to erode parts of the law. It said it will not enforce the individual mandate, the requirement that everyone have health insurance or pay a penalty, which experts say is needed to keep healthy people in the markets and offset more expensive patients.  Dave Jones, the California state insurance commissioner, wrote a letter to Trump earlier last month requesting that the administration “stop taking administrative actions which undermine the Affordable Care Act and destabilize health insurance markets across the country.” Jones is also running for attorney general in California, a heavily Democratic state where fighting the Trump administration is a key political asset. If the administration does not enforce the law, “we will certainly look at all our legal options and remedies that might be available,” he said.

2019-07-23 00:00:00,2019,7.0,23,"Climate crisis might be behind the rise of superbug C. auris, study suggests"," (CNN)The climate crisis may be to blame for the mysterious spread of a multidrug-resistant superbug, Candida auris, according to a study published Tuesday. Until recently, scientists considered it a mystery how C. auris popped up in more than 30 countries around the globe a decade after it was first discovered in 2009. It emerged simultaneously on three continents -- in India, Venezuela and South Africa -- between 2012 and 2015, each strain being genetically distinct. The new study, published in the journal mBio, says this serious public health threat may be the first example of a new fungal disease emerging because of the climate crisis. ""The argument that we are making based on comparison to other close relative fungi is that as the climate has gotten warmer, some of these organisms, including Candida auris, have adapted to the higher temperature, and as they adapt, they break through human's protective temperatures,"" said co-author Dr. Arturo Casadevall, chairman of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  ""Global warming may lead to new fungal diseases that we don't even know about right now."" Experts have warned that the climate crisis could ""halt and reverse"" progress made in human health. For the study, researchers looked at the thermal susceptibility of C. auris and found that it was able to adapt and grow at higher temperatures than many of its fungi relatives are able to tolerate. This study theorizes that C. auris was an environmental fungus initially found in wetlands and may have had an intermediate host like a sea bird and then been passed to humans. Fungal infections are relatively rare in humans because the fungi can't grow in the body's temperature range and because of the body's natural host defense mechanisms. Earlier studies have shown that of the millions of species of fungi, only a few hundred cause human disease. Severe cases of this superbug can cause a blood infection in some patients according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and it poses a ""serious global health threat."" The fungus can linger on medical equipment at health care and long-term care facilities and can transfer from one person to another, earlier studies have shown. Since there may be other factors that have led to the emergence of this superbug, the authors suggest more research is needed. A study published earlier this year suggested that a change in climate conditions could change the environmental spread of fungi and influence its ability to infect others, but ""given an absence of knowledge about its natural habitat, it is impossible at this time to determine whether climatic changes played a role in its recent emergence as a human pathogen."" Other studies have blamed the widespread use of antifungal drugs, but the latest study argues the theory does not easily explain why it suddenly became a human pathogen on three continents. But regardless, better surveillance systems are needed to look for fungal infections like C. auris, authors said. Unless illnesses are reported in medical literature, scientists won't know the fungi is spreading.

2019-12-18 21:07:00,2019,12.0,18,Ancient Humans Tried to Defend Against Rising Seas. They Failed,"I’ve always wondered how ancient civilizations measured things without precise tools or, y’know, empirical science. In my favorite letter of Seneca’s, the famous philosopher requests that his friend climb Mount Etna to see if the rumors are true that the mountain is shrinking (plot twist, it actually is). Other natural phenomena, like sea-level rise and temperature change, must have been similarly difficult to measure. 7,000 years ago, however, the Earth was exiting from a period of global cooling, causing the sea level in the Mediterranean to increase by 4–7 mm each year. This kind of change would have been perceptible, especially to people living on the coast. Now, archeologists have found evidence that a Neolithic settlement off the Carmel Coast in Israel did notice, and tried in vain to protect themselves by building a coastal wall. The archeologists published their discovery on Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE. “We don't have any documents because in those days, there was no writing, but we have a silent evidence of these communities and these societies that lived on the coastline, and today, they're under the sea,” said Ehud Galili, the first author of the study. The wall, part of an underwater archeological site first discovered in the 1960s, is now the oldest man-made coastal barrier on record. To Galili, the structure demonstrates that the Tel Hreiz archeological site was capable of adapting to a problem that many coastal areas face, even though they ultimately failed. “They were resilient enough to make a risk assessment of the situation and to realize that something is going on and they have to do something about it,” he said. He added that the barrier may have worked for the settlers for a couple of decades, but the sea level continued to rise, forcing the people who lived in the settlement to abandon it. Today, the settlement is 3–4 meters under the sea. The remaining seawall consists of a series of large, rounded boulders that weigh between 200 and 1,000 kilograms each and stretch over 100 meters in length. According to the study, the size of these boulders—as well as the fact that the nearest natural source of them was over a kilometer away—indicate that they could not have been moved alone, but rather in a concerted effort that may have included oxen. Near the wall, divers found piles of wooden posts, animal bones, and a wooden bowl. By measuring the presence of radioactive carbon elements in the wooden posts, bones, and bowl, the archeologists collected multiple measurements that all pointed to an age of 7,000 years. Additionally, Galili said that the styles of the bowl and other pottery found near the wall provided cultural dating that supported their estimate, much like how one can figure out the date of a model of a car based on its appearance. In the Neolithic age, sea-level rise was caused by the natural geological phenomenon of an interglacial period following an Ice Age, but today, there is evidence that global sea level is rising at an increased rate due to human activity. Already, places like New Orleans, Venice and Tuvalu are sinking, and the cost of infrastructure to protect against coastal flooding is estimated to be as high as $18.3 trillion. Galili said that the wall is both a glimpse into prehistory and a warning for our future. “We may have to make hard decisions in the future, similar to those made by the Neolithic people: that is, adaptation versus evacuation.”",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/m7qjpq/ancient-humans-tried-to-defend-against-rising-seas-they-failed,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,581

2018-08-30 20:51:00,2018,8.0,30,"San Francisco Denies Scooter Permits to Uber, Lyft, Bird, and Others"," San Francisco just slammed the door on scooter companies hoping to do business in the city. Today, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) announced which scooter startups will receive special operating permits, after citizens opposed their tactics, likening them to a sidewalk plague, and claiming they posed a threat to pedestrian safety. Of at least twelve companies that applied to the 12-month pilot program, only Scoot and Skip were granted permission by the city. Skip claimed to be “the first permitted system operating anywhere,” co-founder and CEO Sanjay Dastoor told Techcrunch in May, having partnered with Washington, DC at the time. Today’s ruling is a giant middle-finger to Uber, Lyft, Bird, and others who did not receive permits. A spokesperson for SFMTA told the San Francisco Examiner that its decision marks “the next chapter in the shared mobility story,” and that it expects “private operators will act in the public interest, that’s what the permit process is all about.” Bird told Motherboard in a statement: This year, startups like Bird and Lime inundated streets with electric scooters. It was a predictable Silicon Valley move—ask for forgiveness, not permission—but one that ired residents, cyclists, and people sick of the tech industry’s lawless recklessness. Scooters were graffitied, disemboweled, and even pooped on to make a point. In May, piles of scooters were used to blockade Google and Apple commuter buses during a protest against “techsploitation” in the Bay Area. Gig economy contractors who earned money by recharging the scooters told Motherboard the job was exploitative at times. Companies like Bird, one charger said, were dismissive when things went wrong, such as workers getting yelled at for retrieving scooters on private property, or the conflicts that arose when people would hoard them in their homes. For the first six months of the program, SFMTA will allow 1,250 scooters within city limits. That number may be increased to 2,500 scooters if things go well. Some of the requirements for Scoot and Skip are rider education tools, a plan to serve low-income communities, and a privacy policy that protects user data. They must also share anonymized trip data with the city, which is a level of transparency that companies such as Uber have historically resisted. San Francisco has been scooter-free since June 4, after the city demanded startups remove their fleets or be fined $100 per scooter. During that time, even more transportation companies branched out into scooters. Uber did so through JUMP, a bike sharing startup that it acquired for roughly $200 million—eventually, it hoped, integrating scooters into its app. We don’t know what this means for the rejected scooter startups. San Francisco was a prime market for the nascent industry, but at least Bird and Lime have launched in several other cities with varying degrees of success, and after lobbying efforts aimed at shaping transportation rules in their favor. The City of Santa Monica also announced its scooter permits today, awarding them to Bird, JUMP, Lime, and Lyft.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kmpm3/san-francisco-denies-scooter-permits-to-uber-lyft-bird-and-others,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,496
2018-04-30 19:05:47,2018,4.0,30,Would AT&T’s Time Warner Deal Help or Hurt Consumers? Judge Will Now Decide,"WASHINGTON — Lawyers faced off over the future of AT&T’s $85.4 billion blockbuster merger with Time Warner for a final time in a courtroom on Monday, sparring over what the deal would mean to consumers. The Justice Department, which sued to block the deal, argued that the merger would cost people millions of dollars a year by limiting competition. If the judge does approve the deal, the government said, the court should force the companies to sell off certain business lines to protect consumers. But the companies countered that the government had failed to make its case. They said consumers would benefit from the merger because it would allow Time Warner and AT&T to compete more effectively against Silicon Valley companies like Google and Netflix. “The only lessening of competition that would occur is if this merger is blocked,” said Daniel Petrocelli, the lead lawyer for AT&T and Time Warner. The judge, Richard J. Leon of United States District Court for the District of Columbia, is expected to rule on the case on June 12. He has given little indication of his thinking throughout the trial, and he gave no sign of his leanings on Monday, either. The six-week courtroom battle, featuring top executives and glimpses of trade secrets, has been one of the most closely watched antitrust cases in years. It has the potential to reshape the fast-changing telecom and entertainment landscape, which is facing new competition from tech companies. The judge’s opinion could also help set the course for antitrust regulation in the years ahead. A victory for the companies could embolden executives to pursue new deals. A government win could slow future deal-making. On Sunday, T-Mobile and Sprint announced a merger to better compete against AT&T, in a deal that is also expected to face close antitrust scrutiny. The case has centered on the question of harm to consumers and whether the merger would lead to price increases. The Justice Department presented several theories for why prices could go up hundreds of millions of dollars a year over all for cable subscribers. The core idea is that AT&T could threaten to withhold Time Warner content, like N.B.A. games and CNN, to extract more money from rival cable and satellite operators that wanted to run that “must-have” programming. The call for selling off business lines showed how little the two sides have changed their strategy throughout the trial. The Justice Department, which had made the same demand before it sued in November, says only the divestitures would solve antitrust concerns because restrictions on business practices are rarely well enforced. The government called witnesses from Dish’s Sling TV and from Cox, Charter and RCN, which provide cable and broadband service, to discuss their fears that AT&T, one of the nation’s largest satellite television providers, would use Time Warner’s programming as its weapon to hurt them. The Justice Department also relied heavily on an economic analysis by Carl Shapiro, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, that estimated monthly cable bills could go up at least 27 cents. “These witnesses came across the country to share their concerns,” said Craig Conrath, the Justice Department’s lead lawyer. He said the potential antitrust violations from the deal were not “theoretical.” “There are hundreds of millions of dollars in harms to consumers,” Mr. Conrath said. AT&T and Time Warner fiercely attacked those economic arguments during the trial and in the closing argument on Monday. Rivals are always motivated to argue against the activities of competitors, Mr. Petrocelli said. The companies assailed the economic analysis of Mr. Shapiro, saying the data sets used were not complete and cherry-picked points. “It is the centerpiece of this case,” Mr. Petrocelli said. But he said Mr. Shapiro’s arguments were “a complete failure of proof.” The companies’ ability to raise doubts about the Justice Department’s case put the government in a challenging position, analysts said. “The burden of proof is on the government, and the consensus view is that it would be an uphill battle for the government,” said Paul Glenchur, a senior telecommunications and cable analyst for Hedgeye Potomac Research. For a merger focused on the future of technology, the trial felt stuck in time. A clock on the wall was frozen at 5:05. Cellphones and other device were forced off. Lawyers relied on boxes of files and binders wheeled in on library carts. Judge Leon, with bow ties and cuff links, was a stickler for order and schedules. He took careful notes by pencil. Political questions have hovered over the trial, but have not been allowed in the courtroom. President Trump, a vocal critic of Time Warner’s CNN, said during the election campaign that the merger should be blocked. Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department’s head of antitrust, told the court in filings that the White House had not influenced his decision. Judge Leon, however, said he wanted to keep the trial focused on the merits of the deal. The outcome of the trial may not be a simple yes or no on the merger. Judge Leon may push the parties to work out a settlement that would let the merger proceed with the promise of assigning a third-party arbitrator to resolve business disputes over Time Warner content. He could also, as the government suggested, demand that some parts of the merged company be sold before the deal is approved.

He was 81. The cause was malignant melanoma, said his wife, Susan Kelly. Over his career, largely spent at Harvard Medical School and at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Dr. Blackburn correlated poor nutrition with obesity, advocated lower-fat diets and helped develop gastric bypass surgery and nutritional liquid diets. He joined Dr. Bruce Bistrian and other colleagues in providing the foundation for what became the field of nutrition medicine. “What really put him and his colleagues on the world map were publications highlighting the inadequate nutritional management of people in the hospital — so-called hospital malnutrition,” said a former colleague, Dr. Steven Heymsfield. Dr. Blackburn helped develop nutritious liquid and solid diets, supplementing them with protein to encourage loss of body fat while preserving muscle. These “protein sparing” diets protected the heart and other organs, and one of these, the protein-sparing modified fast, “became the basis for the low-carb and the very-low-calorie diet for obesity,” said Dr. Caroline Apovian, a former colleague.

Dr. Blackburn was a professor of nutrition at Harvard and at Beth Israel was the chief of the Nutrition/Metabolism Laboratory and director of the Center for the Study of Nutrition Medicine. He was not an absolutist. The occasional craving for a brownie or a French fry could be indulged, he said; otherwise dieters might abandon their self-discipline. He also practiced what he preached, walking several miles every morning and bounding up eight flights of stairs to his office. Dr. Blackburn also followed five strategies he developed during four decades of encouraging patients to shed pounds. They were summarized in the most recent Harvard Heart Letter: • Make time to prepare healthy meals. • Eat slowly. • Consume evenly sized meals, beginning with breakfast. • Do not skimp on sleep. • Weigh yourself often. George Lincoln Blackburn was born on Feb. 12, 1936, in McPherson, Kan., a city in the center of the state. He was raised in Joplin, Mo. His father, also named George, sold farm equipment. His mother was the former Betty Warrick. After graduating from the University of Kansas with a bachelor’s in chemistry, he served in the Navy before attending the University of Kansas School of Medicine on the G.I. Bill. He trained in surgery at Boston City Hospital and earned a doctorate in nutritional biochemistry from M.I.T. His first marriage, to the former Dona Seacat, ended in divorce. Besides Ms. Kelly, he is survived by three children from his first marriage, Amy, David and Matthew Blackburn; a daughter from his second marriage, Vali Blackburn Udin; 10 grandchildren; and a great-grandson. Dr. Blackburn advocated a diet of lean meat, fish and fowl supplemented by vitamins and minerals. He often said that even a small decrease in caloric intake could result in healthier weight. But he said sustained weight loss required a three-pronged approach: “Cut the calories, eat quality food and exercise.” In 2005, he resigned from a McDonald’s advisory council on balanced lifestyles because, he said, the company had not incorporated his message in its health education campaign. “The first two messages weren’t making it through,” he said. Instead, the campaign focused largely on exercise. “If I were on the exercise side, I’d be ecstatic,” Dr. Blackburn said. “But I’m focused on the role of food in a healthy lifestyle. Every scientist knows that increasing exercise is not going to replace cutting the calories.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/health/george-blackburn-dead-nutrition-expert.html,health,The New York Times,health,631
2018-07-02 10:54:23,2018,7.0,2,Why Amazon’s Push Into Prescription Drugs Isn’t a Guaranteed Success,"Amazon has transformed the way Americans buy products as different as books and diapers, but with drugs, it will need to work with powerful entrenched players. When Amazon announced last week that it was buying the online pharmacy PillPack, it sent stocks of drugstore companies like Walgreens and Rite Aid tumbling, as investors worried that the retail behemoth would soon upend the pharmacy market. But even though Amazon has transformed the way Americans buy products as different as books and diapers, it may not have such an easy time with prescription drugs. That’s because to succeed, it will have to do business with powerful entrenched companies who are not necessarily wishing Amazon well. As a relatively small pharmacy with about $100 million in annual revenues, PillPack most likely didn’t attract much attention from the pharmacy industry’s giants, said Eric Percher, an equity research analyst at Nephron Research. “I think they have absolutely been able to fly under the radar,” he said. But now that a household name like Amazon is buying the company, “the entities that have enabled PillPack’s success — whether they knew it or not — have a decision to make,” he said. PillPack, which was founded in 2013, distributes pills in easy-to-use packages designed for consumers with chronic conditions and multiple prescriptions. The company sorts prescriptions by the dose and includes a label with a picture of each pill and directions on how it should be taken. While the company had a niche appeal, many analysts have speculated that Amazon’s true motivation for buying PillPack is to leapfrog its way into the broader prescription drug business because PillPack has pharmacy licenses in 50 states. It also has relationships with the major pharmacy benefit managers, like Express Scripts and CVS Health, that serve as gatekeepers to the majority of Americans who are covered by health insurance. “If you want to be a major factor in prescription drugs, you’re going to have to have some relationship with a P.B.M.,” said John Sculley, a former chief executive of Apple, who is now the chief marketing officer of RxAdvance, a pharmacy benefit manager. Benefit managers have come under criticism for unfairly excluding pharmacies from their networks. In 2016, PillPack publicly tussled with Express Scripts after the benefit manager excluded the start-up from its mail-order network, saying that PillPack had misrepresented itself as a brick-and-mortar company. Although that dispute was resolved, Express Scripts said on Friday that its network agreement with PillPack was expiring in July and that the two companies had not reached an agreement on rates. It also said that it was investigating PillPack for “provider compliance,” although it did not elaborate. CVS Health said PillPack is in “many” of its pharmacy networks, including for commercially insured consumers as well as Medicare beneficiaries. OptumRx, another large benefit manager, did not comment, although a spokeswoman for PillPack said the company was in OptumRx’s commercial pharmacy network. She declined to comment on the negotiations over the Express Scripts contract. Mr. Percher said other industry players may also have an interest in muting Amazon’s success. PillPack gets its drugs from AmerisourceBergen, a major distributor. Walgreens owns 26 percent of AmerisourceBergen and this year was reported to be in talks to buy the company, a tie that Mr. Percher said could pose a conflict if Amazon sought to directly compete with Walgreens. Ana Gupte, a senior health care analyst for Leerink Partners, said some of these companies could opt to partner with Amazon instead. “They have to decide whether Amazon is a valid threat, or an opportunity,” Ms. Gupte said. If Express Scripts finds a way to exclude them from its pool of customers, “Amazon will find other ways to get into the market, and they will become a competitor,” she said. Indeed, several industry executives, including Tim Wentworth, the chief executive of Express Scripts, have expressed interest in working with Amazon. Express Scripts announced in March that it was being acquired by the insurer Cigna, one of many health care mergers that were seen to have been motivated, at least in part, by hints of Amazon’s potential entry into the market. But Nadina J. Rosier, the health and group benefits pharmacy practice leader at the consulting firm Willis Towers Watson, said she was skeptical that Amazon would link up with an established company. “It’s looking to partner with other innovators, not just your standard vendors like your traditional P.B.M.s,” she said. Any partner “would have to be one that brings something to the table in an innovative way.” The months of speculation have allowed competitors to prepare, acting as “a catalyst for participants to close ranks against competition and invest to improve the consumer experience,” Mr. Percher wrote in a research note last week. Last fall, CVS announced it would offer next-day delivery of prescription drugs and same-day service in some big cities. The next-day delivery began in June, for a fee of $4.99. In a statement, Express Scripts touted the breadth of its services, saying it delivered more than 100 million prescriptions to patients around the country in 2017. “Our scale and quality of care provides patients with access to a broader suite of products than other smaller pharmacies,” the company said. Nevertheless, customers have long complained that the mail-order pharmacies run by companies like Express Scripts and CVS are cumbersome and confusing — perhaps one reason, even in an era of online shopping, that 90 percent of prescriptions are filled at a retail pharmacy counter, according to the data research firm IQVIA. Peter Blicher, 70, of Vacaville, Calif., said he has used several different mail-order pharmacies over the years. “It’s very difficult to do business with them, takes multiple interaction, the customer service is very poor,” he said. If Amazon were to begin selling prescription drugs, he said, he would sign up. “I haven’t found another e-commerce website that can compare,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/02/health/amazon-pillpack-drugs.html,health,The New York Times,health,982
2019-10-24 12:31:00,2019,10.0,24,Inside the U.S. Cyber Army," The U.S. military prides itself on being one of the most powerful militaries on the face of the earth. The best trained, the best equipped with the latest wartech, the most mobile, with a power projection around the world. It’s why, sadly, as the Bureau of Investigative Journalism—which tracks U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Somalia—maintains that the American military has killed as many as over 12,000 people in targeted strikes since 2004. Of those numbers, close to 1,800 are civilians and up to nearly 400 of that number, are kids. There’s even been consideration on whether or not the U.S. military could have at on point taken on the entire world in the kinetic reality of ground, air, and sea war. But in 2019, the American war machine doesn’t simply need soldiers,helicopters, or F-22s. It needs hackers to infiltrate secure networks, to spy, or disrupt critical infrastructure of an enemy during any given military operation. In order to professionalize and certify its importance within the military, the Department of Defense officially elevated “Cyber Command” as its cyberspace force in 2018 to do just that, giving it the distinction of being one of its eleven “unified combatant commands.” In other words, USCYBERCOM (as its known for short) joins other permanent forces that are designated across DoD with a broad mandate during times of peace and war. For example, the special forces has its own Special Forces Command, while AFRICOM looks after African centric military operations. According to its mission statement, USCYBERCOM first defends DoD assets, then it’s responsible for “providing support to combatant commanders for execution of their missions around the world, and strengthening our nation's ability to withstand and respond to cyber attack.” Already there are media reports showing USCYBERCOM coordinating hacking operations against ISIS with the help of the NSA and carrying out a top secret “strike” on Iranian government propaganda wings in response to Tehran’s attacks on a Saudi oil field. On this week’s CYBER we’ve got Dave Weinstein, a former member of USCYBERCOM and the now CSO of cybersecurity firm Claroty, to give us the inside tract on how this new American cyber army functions.

The report is unconfirmed and The Verge has reached out for comment. The Digitimes source claims that Asus is shipping an average of just 5,000 to 6,000 ZenWatch units per month across the product line, sales that are low enough that Asus is expected to discontinue the product line. If true, Asus exiting the Android Wear business would mark yet another major hardware manufacturer bailing on Google’s smartwatch platform, alongside companies like Motorola (which has put off smartwatches “indefinitely”) and Samsung (who has shifted focus to its own Tizen-based Gear line). The ZenWatch products were among the most affordable Android Wear devices, too. But even as traditional hardware companies are backing away from Android Wear devices, fashion companies seem to be picking up the slack; a host of new Android Wear 2.0 watches is set to arrive later this year from decidedly less tech-focused brands like Tommy Hilfiger and Hugo Boss.",https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/5/15/15640372/asus-zenwatch-android-wear-watches-ended-low-sales,Tech,The Verge,technology,178
2019-01-23 00:00:00,2019,1.0,23,Microsoft Bing briefly blocked in China: Company says site was 'inaccessible',"Hong Kong (CNN Business)Microsoft's Bing search engine briefly hit a wall in China. Microsoft confirmed Thursday that Bing was unavailable in China, raising concerns that it could be the latest in a growing list of global internet platforms to be shut out of China's huge market.  Hours later, however, some users were once again able to access the service. ""We can confirm that Bing was inaccessible in China, but service is now restored,"" a Microsoft (MSFT) spokesperson told CNN Business on Thursday.  Bing is the last major foreign search engine operating in China after Google (GOOGL) pulled out in 2010. The service interruption suggested that even tech companies that submit to Beijing's strict internet censorship regime can still run into trouble in the country.  Microsoft's potential setback comes as China and the United States are locked in a widening confrontation over technology and access to each other's markets that experts warn could be the start of an economic cold war.  It wasn't immediately clear why Bing was being blocked. China's internet regulator didn't respond to a request for comment Thursday, and the Foreign Ministry declined to comment.  Chinese users first noticed problems with the search engine late Wednesday, when the phrase ""Can't access Bing"" started popping up on social media.  ""It's not the first time that we've encountered issues like this for Bing in China, these do arise periodically,"" Microsoft President Brad Smith said during a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  Microsoft, which recently overtook Apple (AAPL) as the world's most valuable company, has encountered problems in China before. The company's internet video and phone call platform Skype was pulled from Apple and third-party Android app stores in China in November 2017.  The Bing blackout comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping's government seeks to tighten its control of the internet using the vast censorship apparatus known as the Great Firewall. On Wednesday, the same day Bing started to become inaccessible for users, the Cyberspace Administration of China announced that it had closed 733 websites and shut down 9,382 apps in a crackdown on ""harmful"" information. ""Over the past couple months, it appears the Chinese government has improved [the] accuracy and frequency of the Great Firewall blocking,"" said Sunday Yokubaitis, CEO of internet services company Golden Frog.  ""The Great Firewall is only getting better,"" he added. Smith said Microsoft isn't certain whether the blocking of its search engine ""is confined to Bing or if it is something that is broader.""  Playing by Beijing's rules Top US internet platforms like Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and YouTube have been blocked for years. Chinese censors crack down on content and conversations about subjects deemed sensitive by Beijing, including the Tiananmen Square massacre, Tibet and criticism of President Xi. They also punish sites that fail to weed out material like pornography and crude content that the ruling Communist Party considers vulgar or otherwise harmful to society.  Bing was able to operate its Chinese site, cn.bing.com, because it censored its search results.  Microsoft is part of the Internet Society of China, a government-linked body whose members pledge to refrain ""from establishing links to websites that contain harmful information"" or share any content which could ""jeopardize state security and disrupt social stability, contravene laws and regulations and spread superstition and obscenity."" Smith said Microsoft has ""days when there are either difficult negotiations or even disagreements"" with Chinese authorities about search results on Bing.  ""But we're not aware of any ongoing negotiation or disagreement, so we're working to understand it better,"" he added, referring to its sudden inaccessibility. Human rights groups have repeatedly criticized international companies for adhering to Beijing's strict censorship rules. But China has more than 770 million internet users and a thriving online shopping market, making it impossible for top tech companies to ignore.  Google came under fire last year when news emerged that it was planning to launch a censored version of its search app in China. The company effectively left China in 2010 when it stopped running its censored Google.cn service.  Chinese tech firm Baidu is the dominant player, accounting for 70% of the market last year, according to research firm StatCounter. Alibaba-backed (BABA) Shenma is the second biggest with about 16%. Bing has struggled to make significant inroads in China, capturing just 2% of the search market.   ""Bing has a tiny market share in China, but appearance matters to Beijing,"" said Lokman Tsui, associate professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and former head of free expression at Google in Asia.  ""In a year when the 30th anniversary of Tiananmen is coming up, and at a time when the economy is not doing well, Beijing needs to look like they are in charge and in power,"" he said, referring to the Chinese government's deadly crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989.

2020-01-07 00:00:00,2020,1.0,7,"Apple returns to CES to talk privacy, not products","Las Vegas (CNN Business)For the first time in 28 years, Apple is participating in CES, the world's largest technology conference.  But the iPhone maker isn't in Las Vegas this week to introduce a new product. It's going there to preach about privacy.  Jane Horvath, Apple's senior director of global privacy, participated in a standing-room-only session on Tuesday titled ""Chief Privacy Officer Roundtable: What Do Consumers Want?"" The panel also featured Erin Egan, Facebook's VP of public policy and chief privacy officer for policy; Susan Shook, global privacy officer of Procter & Gamble (PG); and Rebecca Slaughter, a Federal Trade Commissioner. ""At Apple, the way we define privacy is to put the consumers in the driver's seat,"" Horvath said at the session. ""They should have control over their data, they should have choices over their data."" The panel marked Apple's unofficial return to the show for the first time since former CEO John Sculley debuted the Newton personal digital assistant in 1992.  Privacy is a hot topic at CES this year. Several of the biggest tech companies attending the tech conference this week are putting a special emphasis on user privacy, following years of mounting scrutiny from regulators and consumers over the industry's handling of personal data. Egan defended Facebook at Tuesday's session as a privacy-focused company. She pointed to Facebook's updated ""Privacy Checkup"" tool, announced this week, which walks users through key privacy settings. ""You can offer a privacy-protected ad business model, and we do,"" she said. Some of her comments drew audible snickers from members of the audience. The social media giant has been plagued with privacy concerns in recent years and has faced a long list of scandals.  FTC Commissioner Slaughter pushed back on tech companies during the session, and said she's concerned about the onus being placed on consumers when it comes to data privacy.  ""It's also important that we think about ways that the burden be placed not just on the consumer, but that the collectors and stewards of data have the responsibility to minimize what's collected, minimize what's retained ... without creating this endless trove of data,"" she said.  Although Apple (AAPL) didn't have an official presence last year, it threw shade at rivals with a billboard overlooking the Las Vegas Convention Center that said: ""What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone"". Apple has hammered on its dedication to privacy as a marketing pitch in recent years, with CEO Tim Cook repeatedly calling privacy a fundamental human right. Cook also told CNN that he wants governments around the world to restrict how much data companies can collect from their customers. But that doesn't mean Apple hasn't had privacy issues of its own.  Last year, the company apologized for allowing contractors to listen to commands that users gave to its voice assistant Siri without informing users that it was doing so. The company also pledged changes, including requiring users to opt in to having their recordings listened to by human reviewers, rather than having this be the default. Amazon has similarly been criticized for listening to Alexa user recordings. It's also faced its share of security flaws with the iPhone. For example, with the release of the iOS 13 operating system in September, contact details stored in iPhones were exposed without requiring a passcode or biometric identification.

2018-09-30 00:00:00,2018,9.0,30,"Teachers use meditation apps to rewire kids' brains, improve focus","Brooke Waterman shuts the lights off in her classroom and the students settle in. Some sit with their legs crisscrossed. Others lie down on the rug. They close their eyes, and she turns on a guided meditation through the Calm app. It's so quiet you can hear a pin drop. Her second graders are never more quiet and focused than when they're meditating, she says. ""It's amazing to see these kids really tune into themselves and ignore the outside world for a minute,"" said Waterman, a teacher at Springbrook Elementary School in Westerly Rhode Island. Between homework, tests, problems at home and in their social lives, kids are under intense pressure. More than a quarter of teens report feeling extreme stress during the school year, according to a 2013 survey from the American Psychological Association. Nearly half said they weren't doing enough or weren't sure if they were doing enough to manage their stress. Teachers around the country like Waterman are using popular apps Calm and Headspace to introduce meditation to their lesson plans to help curb anxiety and improve performance in the classroom. The American Academy of Pediatrics encourages parents and teachers to teach kids meditation, saying it helps them function more effectively and clearly. A 2015 report by the National Institutes of Health found that teaching children mindful activities like yoga and meditation can improve their cognitive, social and emotional skills as well as their academic performance. One trial by the AAP found that teaching mindfulness in schools could even lower symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. ""I think a lot of education focuses on remembering facts or things that aren't necessarily dealing with your own life skills or tools to deal with emotions,"" said Calm co-founder Alex Tew. ""So I think mindfulness is incredibly important for all ages, but if we can teach the kids to meditate, that's an amazing, actually world-changing opportunity."" Calm launched Calm Schools in May of 2016, giving kindergarten through 12th grade teachers around the world free access to some of the app's meditation and mindfulness exercises. In just over two years, 54,000 teachers across 140 countries have signed up, with 41,000 from the U.S. Competitor Headspace takes a slightly different approach. It works directly with 35 districts and around 300 schools in 15 states to offer their teachers access to the mindfulness app. One of those districts is Broward County. Headspace connected with the district earlier this year after a shooting at one of its schools, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Calm Classroom, a nonprofit not affiliated with the Calm app, trains educators to teach mindfulness in the classroom. It studied the impact of its program at Wendell Smith Elementary, a Chicago Public School that teaches preschool through eighth grade. Its research showed practicing mindfulness led to a 69 percent decrease in students disrupting classroom instruction, a 91 percent decrease in running or excessive noise in the hallways and a 72 percent decrease in fighting, bullying and disruptive behavior. Meditating improves performance by increasing connectivity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex — a key area of the brain associated with executive control, according to a 2017 NIH study. That helps boost the mental processes that regulate attention, decision making, impulse inhibition, working memory, time management, critical reasoning and problem solving. One 2017 NIH study found that meditation increases resting state functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -- a key region that is broadly implicated in regulating attention, decision making, short-term memory and cognitive control For teachers who are new to meditation, apps are trying to fill the void. Christina Machado, a teacher at Sally Ride Elementary School in Los Angeles, started using the app Calm's guided meditations to settle her students after lunch and recess four years ago. At first, she couldn't get them to sit still for more than a minute, then it was three minutes, then five minutes. Now, if she forgets about it after lunch or recess, students will remind her ""it's time for Calm."" Their favorite guided meditation is called the body scan, which focuses on relaxing different parts of the body. ""During lunch and recess, you see your friends and your energy is all over the place and you end up wasting 10 minutes to sit down and say, 'Let's start math,'"" Machado said. ""But if I spend three to five minutes on the body scan, it deregulates them almost immediately.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/30/teachers-are-using-calm-headspace-to-teach-mindfulness.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,733

It can be used for everything from signaling to locomotion, but for a team of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, the most relevant use of the tail is how it can be use for stabilizing a body while it's in motion. In particular, this team was interested in stabilizing the body of its Jeroba robot, a bipedal machine which hops like a frog. Previously, the team had used the Jeroba's tail as a mechanism to energize its spring legs, but in order for the bot to move around in this manner, the team had to figure out a way to stabilize the robot while it pitched and rolled in the air from jumping. To allow the tail to have the range of freedom it would need to offset the in-air rolling motion, the researchers connected the tail pole to two of the tail motors to ""effectively create a spherical joint."" When the spherical joint, which functions as a roll controller, is combined with the tail's function as a spring energizer, it offsets the rolling motion enough to allow the robot to maintain an acceptable degree of stability while hopping.

Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimrama issued a directive banning unnecessary gatherings of more than 20 people to combat the spread of the virus on Thursday after a flight attendant tested positive for COVID-19 in the city of Lautoka. “In the best interest of preserving and protecting the health and safety of Fijians ... the Board was left with very little choice but to suspend rugby competitions and events for the short term future,” the Fiji Rugby Union Board said in a statement.

The fundraising comes as the six-year-old firm is considering an initial public offering in Hong Kong next year and has been in talks with investment banks for a multi-billion-dollar listing, two of the sources said. How successful Bytedance’s fundraising is will be an indicator of broader appetite for Chinese investments amid heightened Sino-U.S. trade tensions and Beijing’s debt crackdown that are slowing the Chinese economy and aggravating tight market liquidity. Fast-growing Bytedance runs China’s popular news feed Jinri Toutiao and short video platform TikTok, which was also the world’s most downloaded app in the first quarter. Founded by entrepreneur Zhang Yiming in 2012, Bytedance is targeting a valuation of between $70 billion and $75 billion in the latest fundraising, said one of the people. That would rank it as the world’s second-largest “unicorn” - private firms valued at $1 billion or more - eclipsing ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] with a valuation of $68 billion and trailing only Ant Financial which was valued at $150 billion after a June funding round. Bytedance counts venture firm Sequoia Capital, big private equity firms such as KKR, General Atlantic and Hillhouse Capital Group as backers, according to sources, but unlike most Chinese startups, it is independent from China’s duo of tech heavyweights - Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group. Alibaba held talks with Bytedance earlier this year about a potential acquisition or investment, but was turned down by the content aggregator, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. Tencent, on the other hand, once owned a small stake in the company and later exited, two separate people told Reuters. Bytedance declined to comment. Tencent didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for Alibaba declined to comment. The group’s public relations head denied such investment plans in April in a Weibo post. The Wall Street Journal first reported about Bytedance’s latest fundraising round. Bytedance was seeking a $10 billion valuation in a late 2016 funding round, sources familiar with the fundraising said at the time. About a year ago, the firm was raising at least $2 billion at a valuation of over $20 billion. The valuation exceeded $30 billion earlier this year and as its new video streaming apps such as TikTok gained user traffic, secondary market trading of its shares would value the firm at over $50 billion or $60 billion at times, according to sources familiar with the trades. Bytedance started from news aggregator Jinri Toutiao, or “Today’s Headlines” in Chinese, which uses algorithms and artificial intelligence to select news, online books, videos and other content for readers, with the bulk of its revenue coming from advertising. Since late last year, the firm established another business segment - entertainment, with a number of short video streaming apps and a $1 billion acquisition of popular lip-sync platform Musical.ly, which it shuttered and merged with TikTok last week. Despite its quick success, the company has faced mounting scrutiny from China’s internet censors, with Toutiao temporarily taken off app stores for a cleanup in April while a separate joke app was permanently shut.

2019-10-27 17:00:00,2019,10.0,27,Tim McGraw Shows Off His Ripped Body: 'Best Shape of My Life',"Tim McGraw is looking and feeling better than ever. On Sunday, the country superstar, 52, shared a photo of himself at the gym and celebrated his continued fitness success, which he refers to as “the best shape of my life.” “My whole life, I’ve lived according to one key value,” McGraw began. “I guess I’ve done so from an early age, when I wanted so fiercely to get beyond my circumstances. That value is, Be ready. Be primed for opportunity when it shows up, because it will come once, it will move on quick, and if you’re not ready to make the shot, your whole destiny can change in a heartbeat.” The father of three added, “Miss that moment, and you’ll live the rest of your life wondering just how much of your potential never played out. That’s when I decided to go from being in good shape to being in the best shape of my life.” In March, McGraw spoke to PEOPLE about his new health and lifestyle book that will be released on Nov. 5, Grit & Grace: Train the Mind, Train the Body, Own Your Life, where he shares his transformation story. “I’ve gone through a physical transformation in the last 10 years, but it’s not just my appearance that has changed,” he said. “My mind is clearer, my sense of purpose is sharper, and my relationships are deeper. Consistent physical exercise helps me bring focus to my life and to the people who mean the most to me.” McGraw continued: “That’s something we all want. And I believe it’s something that is available to anyone who wants it, regardless of their level of fitness. I want this book to help people find what works for them by sharing the mental and physical approach that has worked for me.” Grit & Grace will delve into McGraw’s personal health journey. It will also share his exercise tips and mental approach so readers can improve their own wellbeing. Rather than following a set routine, McGraw explained that each person needs to create a personal vision and commit to it, which he did for himself 10 years ago. McGraw used to drink before every show to alleviate his nerves. That all changed in 2008, when he decided to cut alcohol out of his life entirely after friends voiced their concern. Instead of drinking, McGraw began to workout twice a day, he told PEOPLE in 2013. “That’s where my workout program came into play,” he said. “It took the place of alcohol and it is really important.” Within two years, McGraw had unintentionally lost 40 lbs. “It wasn’t like I was trying to lose 40 pounds, I was just wanting to get healthy,” he said. “For me, it is more about feeling good and being where I want to be physically and on stage. When I am on stage in 98 degrees out there, you want to feel good. And my show isn’t stand out there and not move around.” McGraw has credited his health transformation to his wife and fellow country star, Faith Hill, 52, and their three daughters: Gracie, 22, Maggie, 21, and Audrey, 17. “I just want to be around. I want to be around for my kids, I want to be around to see their kids, I want to be around to watch them grow up and do things,” McGraw told PEOPLE in 2015. “And I feel like the best years I have are ahead of me. I want to be ready for them. I want to be ready for whatever life comes at me later on down the road.” Grit & Grace will be published on Nov. 5.",https://people.com/health/tim-mcgraw-shows-off-ripped-physique-best-shape/,health,People,health,612
2016-06-08 20:09:00,2016,6.0,8,Now This Is How You Blow Up a Dam,"Few things embody the wonders of modern engineering like a giant fucking dam. So, it makes sense that the utter destruction of one would be equally as impressive. A video uploaded to YouTube in 2013 of what appears to be the explosion of a dam or seawall in the port of Risavika, Norway recently surfaced on Reddit, to the delight of demolition enthusiasts everywhere. It's still unclear as to why this enormous monolith was unceremoniously blown to smithereens, but it's possible the dam merely served as a temporary barrier intended to balance the harbor's water levels. As you can see, a sequence of timed pyrotechnic charges make swift work of the Norwegian dam. One commenter pointed out that a shock tube lined with explosive powder was likely used to destroy the dam with such precision, which is evidenced by the series of flashing lights that go off before the eventual blast.  Back in the US, aging dams all over the country are seeing the end of their lives. Tens of thousands of dams in North America are being slated for destruction due to faulty engineering and river damage. Often, the cost of maintaining some of the nation's older dams just isn't worth the risk to public safety and the environment. According to the documentary DamNation, it takes approximately 800 pounds of explosive to completely bring down a big one, and a record-setting 72 dams were removed across the US in 2014 alone. Hopefully, no fish were harmed in the making of this video.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/53ddx3/now-this-is-how-you-blow-up-a-dam,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,253
2018-03-16 04:15:00,2018,3.0,16,Facebook's Search Bar Briefly Autocompleted to 'Video of Girl Sucking Dick Under Water'," If you typed “video of...” into Facebook’s search bar tonight, you might have seen some disturbing results. The social media platform briefly autocompleted strange phrases for many of its users, such as “video of girl sucking dick under water” and “video of little girl giving oral.”  The issue appears to have been fixed within the last hour, however, and these results are no longer appearing.  Dozens of people have shared screenshots of these results on Twitter. When I attempted to test this on my own Facebook account, I was served the first phrase, but not the latter one.  Motherboard Managing Editor Emanuel Maiberg, did not see any of the two results, but did see results unrelated to his Facebook or internet activity.  It’s unclear why Facebook is autocompleting these phrases. And it’s even more confusing, since neither of the autocompleted phrases return any hits—there are no videos, to my knowledge, on Facebook that are even remotely associated with these two topics.  Facebook did not immediately respond to Motherboard’s request for comment, but we will update our story should the company respond. We do not know how something like this might happen, and Facebook isn’t very transparent about the mechanisms behind its search algorithms.  In the past, Facebook has claimed that results are influenced by a user’s search history and Facebook activity. But for many of us who have never searched these terms, on Facebook or elsewhere, this explanation makes little sense.  “Both your search history and your activity on Facebook contribute to search suggestions, so deleting your search history may not remove certain suggestions from appearing,” a Facebook Help Team representative wrote in 2013.  The social media giant has long struggled to moderate content on its platform. Earlier this month, Facebook published a survey asking users how they would “handle the following: a private message in which an adult man asks a 14-year-old girl for sexual pictures.” None of the answers to the poll included reporting it to authorities, but “This content should be allowed on Facebook, and I would not mind seeing it” was one potential choice. The company later admitted the survey was a mistake, and has since taken it down.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wj7egx/facebook-search-bar-autocomplete-bug-girl-sucking-dick-under-water,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,363
2017-11-22 00:00:00,2017,11.0,22,Facebook to open Nigerian hub next year in African tech drive,"LAGOS (Reuters) - Facebook will open a “community hub space” in Nigeria next year to encourage software developers and technology entrepreneurs and become the latest technology giant to pursue a training program in fast-growing Africa. The U.S. social media company said the center would host an “incubator program” to help develop technology start-ups, while it will also train 50,000 Nigerians in digital skills. Africa’s rapid population growth, falling data costs and heavy adoption of mobile phones rather than PCs is attracting technology companies looking to attract more users. Facebook did not provide details of the period over which its planned training would take place in Nigeria, which is Africa’s most populous country with 180 million inhabitants. “We understand the important role Facebook plays here in Nigeria with developers and start-ups and are invested in helping these communities,” Emeka Afigbo, its regional head of platform partnership, said in a statement on Wednesday. Facebook said the training - aimed at software developers, entrepreneurs and students - would be offered in cities including the capital, Abuja, Port Harcourt in the south, Calabar in the southeast and Kaduna in the north. Last year Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg visited technology companies in Lagos and his charitable foundation provided $24 million to Andela, which trains developers. Google’s chief executive in a July visit to Lagos said the company aimed to train 10 million people across the continent in online skills over the next five years. He also said it hoped to train 100,000 software developers in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. Although Africa may not offer as much opportunity to add consumers as China or India, because large wealth gaps mean that many people in places like Nigeria have little disposable income, Facebook said more than 22 million people already use its social media website every month in Nigeria. Widespread poverty means mobile adoption tends to favor basic phone models. That, combined with poor telecommunications infrastructure, can mean slow internet speeds and less internet surfing, which tech firms rely on to make money.

Talkspace, which launched in 2012, has been growing 70 to 80 percent faster than projected since November 2016, according to CEO and co-founder Oren Frank. Most of the callers have been millennials, with an average age between 33 and 34. On Election Day itself, the company had five to seven times more customers than usual, and it had three times the normal volume on January 20, Inauguration Day. ""There's been a lot of anxiety and stress, which may have been there before,"" Frank said. ""But it's definitely been triggered by Election Night and the Inauguration."" Talkspace lets people work with mental health professionals over the internet. Plans — which start at $32 a week and don't take insurance — allow customers to select a therapist who they correspond with online. The company has treated over half a million people, according to Frank. Most patients check in with their therapist one to two times a day — which can be as small as an email exchange — and have access to video-chat sessions if necessary. ""We think psychotherapy is something everyone and anyone should have access to,"" he said. It isn't clear if the customers are calling in because of Trump or because of general stress these days, Frank points out. But Talkspace's current customer base is about 75 percent Democrats and 20 percent Trump supporters, Frank said. It's also seen a bump in requests from minority, LGBT, Muslim and Jewish customers. More people also feel anxiety over uncertainty about health care, specifically Obamacare. The company is also seeing more women requesting therapy. About 70 percent of their clientele are now women, which has ""expressed itself even more dramatically past the election,"" Frank said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/22/talkspace-online-therapy-grew-80-percent-faster-since-trump-elected.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,299

2017-05-31 00:00:00,2017,5.0,31,Military couples who avoid problems fare worse after deployment,"(Reuters Health) - Military families face many stresses and partners who tend to avoid dealing with issues directly before a deployment are more likely to have mental health and relationship problems after the soldier returns home, according to a recent U.S. study. “A deployment is a stressful event for couples who endure a lengthy separation,” said lead author Adrian Blow, a researcher at Michigan State University in East Lansing. “Service members are deployed in a combat zone with all of the dangers involved. Partners are faced with numerous stressors back home,” he told Reuters Health by email. Some military couples struggle with the stresses of deployment while others are remarkably resilient, the researchers write in the Journal of Clinical Psychology. To determine how personal coping styles before deployment affect the couples afterward, the study team surveyed 122 National Guard members and their partners. Before deployment, the service members and their partners answered questions about their own coping styles to determine if each member of the couple had an active coping style, meaning they tried to reduce the stress of a situation, including accepting it, seeing it in a more positive light, developing strategies to manage issues and/or turning to others for support. Or, if they had an avoidant style, meaning they avoid dealing with problems, rely on denial, giving up or using alcohol or drugs to cope. After deployment, the participants completed questionnaires assessing relationship and parenting issues as well as depression, anxiety and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Relationship issues included problems with joint decision-making, values, affection and satisfaction with the relationship. The researchers found that having an active coping style predeployment did not have a significant effect on any of the outcomes when the soldiers returned from deployment. In contrast, both soldiers and their significant others who had an avoidant coping style were significantly more likely to experience depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms after the soldiers returned home, compared with those who didn’t avoid their issues. Soldiers with more avoidant coping styles had significantly greater parenting stress, while partners of soldiers who were avoidant were more likely to experience relationship stress, the study also found. Avoidance in significant others also had an effect on the soldiers, and military members whose partners were avoidant were more likely to experience parenting stress, compared with other soldiers. “If soldiers are not happy in their family life, they’re not going to do their job as well,” said Howard Markman, a distinguished professor of psychology at the University of Denver and coauthor of the book “Fighting for Your Marriage.” “The best way to help military couples . . . is to help couples learn communication skills and principles that are associated with having a healthy and happy marriage,” Markman, who was not involved in the study, told Reuters Health by email. Important communication skills for couples include being able to call a time-out when things are going badly and to take turns speaking and paraphrasing back what they hear, Markman said. “Get each person’s perspective on the table before trying to solve something,” Markman added. “All couples need a way of talking without fighting about important topics,” he said. “Coping through denial, avoidance, or drugs/alcohol when facing a stressful deployment can have negative implications for one’s mental health and family wellbeing after the deployment is over,” Blow said.

2017-02-10 13:41:00,2017,2.0,10,We Asked People What They Do When They Can't Afford Their Meds," ""I'll take anything for the pain,"" I pleaded with my older brother on the phone, curled into a ball on the pavement. I was eighteen at the time, and had never even smoked a cigarette, let alone done drugs—yet here I was, begging him to buy me narcotics from a local dealer he knew. Only moments before, a stabbing pain had gripped me before I could reach my green Honda near the retail store I worked at. Warmth spread across my upper thighs and lower abdomen, causing me to fall to my knees and call my brother in tears. It would be two more years before doctors would diagnose me with endometriosis, a condition where tissue that normally lines the uterus grows outside of it—producing sharp, agonizing pangs in the abdomen for many, including me. Numerous hospital visits and rounds of antibiotics had done nothing to relieve the pain, yet the bills kept piling up. At the time, I was earning little over minimum wage and barely making ends meet—the thought of amassing thousands in medical debt with no hope of a cure seemed unfathomable. This angst is all too real for many Americans struggling to afford their medical bills. A New York Times article from last year named the United States ""the most expensive place in the world to get sick"", with insurance often failing as a safety net. A situation made even bleaker for those who could stand to lose their insurance—and access to prescription drugs they need—within a year because of an impending ACA repeal. Even for the minimally insured, the cost of repeated doctor's visits can be high enough to avoid them altogether. Some seek out alternative, albeit riskier methods to alleviate symptoms. Here, they explain where they turned.  Sarai*, 23, Chicago, IllinoisI started using weed as a way to function after having a stroke when I was twenty years old. I was diagnosed with something called 'intracranial hypertension,' which is like having a pseudo tumor. My symptoms often included daily migraines that grew with intensity, which meant that I would often be in a completely dark, isolated room, with no light and no sound, and with ice packs completely surrounding my head. I had so many referrals, so many different medications that they wanted me to be trying. There's a migraine medication they prescribed where each pill was individually $150—something absurd. Taking weed [is] not something that I necessarily feel good about doing. I mean, it really sucks whenever I'm having to go pick up, because I'm literally having to do something illegal. But it makes a huge difference—just being able to actually get out of bed as opposed to lying down 20 hours of the day because your head feels like it's being hammered. *Source prefers not to use real name. Derek, 36, Ogden, UtahIn my mid-twenties I had a rotator cuff surgery, and was prescribed an insane amount of powerful opioids. That's when trouble started, because I fell in love with the drug and when the doctor cut me off, I was left with hellish withdrawals and a strong desire to continue taking the pills. My insurance had no problem paying for expensive medications, but wouldn't pay for treatments to reduce my pain. This is when I started buying pills illegally on the streets. Initially I was able to pay for my medication and doctor visits, but as my addiction tore my finances apart, I became unable to pay for prescriptions and preventative treatments that would alleviate a significant amount of pain I had from my broken bones. Alaina, 23, Boston, MassachusettsI have multiple disabilities, but the major ones that cause pain are endometriosis and dyspraxia, which affects my balance, motor skills, and ability to walk—and sometimes causes pain as a result. This past August, I began having extreme pain for no reason, mainly in my stomach and the areas where people typically have period cramps. This was similar to the pain I experienced before being on medication, and it was so severe that I missed weeks of work, and couldn't leave my house. I went to several doctors who were unable to help me, and most days, I tried drinking alcohol simply because it numbed the pain and helped put me to sleep. It affected my quality of life severely because I stopped seeking any further medical treatment for my issue and just waited for the pain to stop on its own. I had to stop working and wait several months to look for new employment, and in the meantime, couldn't afford to try new medical care beyond my regular physician and medication, because of [high] co-pays. LaQuanta, 37, Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaI found out I had pulmonary embolism when I was pregnant with my son—which waspretty shocking at the time. It basically starts as a blood clot in your legs or in your extremities, and then the clot moves up into your lungs, blocking the flow of oxygen. So when I began having trouble breathing while walking up stairs, that's when I went to the hospital and was placed on blood thinners. I was fortunate that I didn't die from that first episode. Afterwards, the only medication available to me cost over $700 a month, and in the beginning, I was doing everything I could to pay for it—using credit cards and moving my bills around to try to have that money available. When I could no longer afford the medication, I started taking less than what I was supposed to be taking because the full doses were so expensive. I felt hopeless—the whole experience was really traumatizing—I was really scared about what would happen to me and my unborn child. Eventually, I ended up having to be admitted to the ER in order to receive my medication. I felt like it was completely about the money, and if you didn't have it, then ""your loss,"" and that just made me feel like less than human. Leah, 32, Fort Wayne, IndianaI cannot afford my psychiatric medications at over $500 per month each, so I gradually took myself off of them, which was probably pretty risky. My bipolar symptoms have returned, and I experience a lot of excruciating mental anguish, not just from being off those meds, but from physical pain as well. I've resorted to cannabis—which is much cheaper than pharmaceuticals—as an anxiety reduction strategy, because I cannot usually bear the burden of another doctor's appointment, as even with the discount, they are usually at least $100 a piece. I feel hopeless. I'm 32, but I feel like I'm 80.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/78dz8q/we-asked-people-what-they-do-when-they-cant-afford-their-meds,Health,Vice,health,1097
2019-06-27 00:00:00,2019,6.0,27,"Huawei's problems are 'net positive' for us, says Nokia executive","London (CNN Business)The US campaign against China's Huawei has been ""net positive"" for rival telecommunications equipment maker Nokia. That's according to Tommi Uitto, president of mobile networks at the Finnish company.  Uitto told CNN Business in an interview Thursday that the political situation has opened the door for Nokia to grab market share. Nokia has signed 43 commercial 5G deals around the world, while Huawei has notched 50. ""There are some countries that have banned Chinese competitors, and of course that creates an opportunity for us,"" Uitto said. Analysts say Nokia had signed about 30 contracts at the end of March, indicating that recently it's been winning more new 5G customers than Huawei, which had announced 40 at that point.  Uitto pointed to Japan, where SoftBank (SFBTF) picked Nokia (NOK) and Ericsson (ERIC) as suppliers for its 5G networks last month. Huawei, a vendor for SoftBank's 4G networks, was snubbed. Nokia has also been able to expand its business in Australia, New Zealand and the United States, where Huawei's involvement in building 5G networks is restricted, Uitto said. The company is in talks to replace equipment from Chinese suppliers in small rural networks in America, he added. It's also been approached by carriers that want to be ready in case more governments limit the use of Huawei products. ""Operators want to anticipate and make sure they are prepared for what may come,"" Uitto said. Huawei is the world's largest telecom equipment maker. But its leading role in the rollout of next-generation wireless networks has been complicated by a US pressure campaign against its business. The United States has pushed allies to ban or restrict Huawei equipment from their 5G networks, citing national security concerns. The Chinese company has repeatedly denied that its products pose a risk. There are downsides The Trump administration also issued an export ban targeting Huawei last month. This could cut off Huawei's access to crucial components from American suppliers. Uitto cautioned that the political situation surrounding Chinese suppliers has had some drawbacks. ""Uncertainty in general is not good for business,"" he said. ""Some of our customers may be delaying their decisions. If you have an operator who has Nokia and a Chinese supplier, then this current situation may delay their own decision-making."" He also said that Huawei could become even more assertive in certain regions. ""It is possible ... that our Chinese competitors become even more aggressive in markets and in countries where they can compete,"" Uitto said. ""They may feel the pressure to backfill the lost business volume in the rest of the world."" ",https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/27/tech/huawei-nokia-5g/index.html,tech,CNN,technology,429
2017-10-18 00:00:00,2017,10.0,18,Alexa's Rohit Prasad: Amazon's next big bet is phone-free talking,"The next big function to take off on Amazon's Echo devices will be voice or video calling — which is a way Alexa can reduce the need to have your smartphone on your at all times, the VP and head scientist at Alexa Machine Learning said. ""If you have not played with calling, and the video calls on Echo Show, you should try it because that is revolutionizing how you can communicate,"" Rohit Prasad said Tuesday in an exclusive interview with CNBC at an Alexa Accelerator event in Seattle. (The event is dedicated to developing new voice-powered technologies.) ""When you can drop in on people who have given you access — so I can drop in and call my mom in her kitchen without her picking any device — it's just awesome."" (Amazon added the ability to call mobile numbers and landlines for free onto Echo devices a few weeks ago.) Amazon doesn't have a smartphone that lets customers bring a digital assistant everywhere — like Apple's Siri and Google's Assistant — and communicating through Alexa devices is one way of reducing the need for a personal handset, Prasad said ""I can easily drop in and talk to my kids,"" Prasad said. ""They don't have a smartphone so that's my easiest way to talk to them. It's yet another area where Alexa is taking the friction away."" Asked whether we'd see a smartphone or smart glasses (which are reportedly in the works) from Amazon, Prasad said he couldn't comment on the future roadmap but he didn't rule it out. ""We do want Alexa to be everywhere, so our customers can do their daily tasks with minimum friction and anywhere they need it,"" he said. Where does Alexa and artificial intelligence fit into Amazon's larger business? ""Jeff [Bezos] has said Alexa could become one of the four pillars,"" Prasad replied. ""I think we want to get there, still very very early for us."" He added with a laugh, ""we have had a pretty good start."" Bezos, in his 2016 letter to shareholders, identified the company's three main pillars: marketplace, Prime and Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business. But he also wrote: ""I assure you that we also remain hard at work on finding a fourth."" Onlookers have speculated that the fourth pillar could be anything from logistics to video content to groceries or Alexa, and Amazon is making big bets in all these spaces. Prasad noted that five years ago Alexa was just getting started. ""Our vision was to build a computer that you can talk to anywhere, built into anything and is accessible to every demand you have and wherever you need it."" Since then, Amazon has sold 15 million Echo units, according to a recent report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prasad said Alexa now has more than 25,000 skills — up from 15,000 in July. Five years from now, users will be having 20-minute conversations with Alexa, he said. Over the summer, Amazon and Microsoft teamed up to work together to extend the abilities of their voice-controlled digital assistants. Some analysts found it an unusual partnership, but Prasad said it was an easy decision. ""Microsoft has all the office applications around calendars, email — clearly that was a great synergistic relationship to have on behalf of our customers and so that was a fairly easy decision for us to make because we want to do the right thing for our customers. Alexa talking to Cortana is going to be better for our customers. "" When asked if Amazon was open to partnerships with other competitors in the artificial intelligence, like Google and Apple, he said he couldn't comment on whether anything was in the works, but said he'd be happy to work with both companies. Correction: This story was revised to correct when Alexa had 15,000 skills. It was in July.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/18/alexas-rohit-prasad-amazons-next-big-bet-is-phone-free-talking.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,644
2019-01-24 00:00:00,2019,1.0,24,"The air quality on cruise ships is so bad, it could harm your health, report says"," (CNN)Cruise ships generate high levels of air pollution that could endanger the health of passengers, staff and port communities, according to an undercover report released Thursday.   On the decks of the four Carnival Corp. cruise ships studied over a two-year period, concentrations of particulate matter measured were ""comparable to concentrations measured in polluted cities, including Beijing and Santiago,"" according to Ryan Kennedy, author of the report and an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.  Ship exhaust contains harmful constituents, including metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, many of which have toxic, possibly cancer-causing properties, Kennedy said: ""It's dangerous it's not a healthy thing for us to be exposed to."" The vessels on which Kennedy took measurements were Carnival Liberty sailing from Florida to the Bahamas; Carnival Freedom sailing from Texas to the Caribbean; Holland America MS Amsterdam sailing from Vancouver to Los Angeles; and Princess Cruises Emerald Princess sailing from Los Angeles to Mexico. (Holland American and Princess Cruises are subsidiaries of Carnival Corp.)  Without the knowledge of the company or ship staff, Kennedy took measurements using a P-TRAK Ultrafine Particle Counter when the ships were docked as well as when moving at sea.  Consistently, Kennedy said, the highest average readings of particulate matter (PM) concentration were found behind the smokestack at the back of the ship. The equipment he used measured particles with sizes between 0.02 and 1.0 micrometers, considered ultrafine and fine PM.  ""What Dr. Kennedy found on board was shocking,"" said Kendra Ulrich, senior shipping campaigner at Stand.earth, the international environmental organization that commissioned the report. She noted that the stern area -- the back of the ship -- may be where running tracks, swimming pools or lounge areas are located, so both passengers and cruise line employees may be spending considerable time in these areas.  ""Stand.earth is campaigning to get Carnival Corp. to stop using heavy fuel oil,"" Ulrich said. ""What this industry giant does can have a huge effect in setting standards for the rest of the industry.""    Carnival said in a statement that it coordinates its cruises with ""national and international regulatory bodies like the [US Environmental Protection Agency] to insure the utmost safety of our guests and crew"" and that tests of the air quality on its ships ""meet or exceed every requirement."" ""Independent testing on our funnels -- which is the area where the exhaust originates -- further validates our claims,"" the company said.  ""This particular organization, for fund raising purposes, is constantly in search of a problem in our industry even if it has to create fake tests that really have no scientific basis."" Megan King, a spokeswoman for the Cruise Lines International Association, an industry advocate, said that ""globally, the cruise industry has already invested $1 billion in new technologies and cleaner fuels to significantly reduce ships' air emissions."" Worldwide, more than 30 million cruise passengers -- the major share residents of the United States -- are expected in 2019, according to the association. The multibillion-dollar industry also provides jobs to upward of 1 million full-time equivalent employees, including thousands who work on the ships themselves.  An unrelated 2007 study found that ""annually, oceangoing ships are estimated to emit 1.2-1.6 million metric tons (Tg) of particulate matter.""   King added that the cruise industry is ""only a small part of this issue"" and that container shipping, as well as other types of tourism, also contribute to marine air pollution. Stand:earth financed the new study ""through the investments of small individual donors online (we have over 150K supporters and volunteers) and major donors as well,"" Executive Director Todd Paglia told CNN in an email. Dr. Andre Nel, a professor of medicine and public health at the University of California Los Angeles, noted that the new study had not been published in a peer-reviewed journal so it lacks independent verification of how the monitoring was done and possible conflicts of interest. Nel, who played no part in the new study, explained that ""ultrafine particles are not yet regulated in the US"" and this is an ""important omission"" in our legislation of air pollution.  ""We have never undertaken to actually make it an official part of our assessment [of air pollution] so that we can determine whether there are threshold numbers that we do not wish to exceed,"" said Nel. Scientists would need to do ""deliberate studies"" to determine what concentrations and amounts affect human health in the same way as has been done with other particulate matter.  That said, he believes based on past research that we ""do have to be careful about human exposure"" to large concentrations of ultrafine particles. Dr. Frank S. Virant, a clinical professor of pediatrics at University of Washington School of Medicine, told CNN in an email that ""given the size and levels of these particles I would say they could potentially be a health issue as they could readily reach the smallest airways."" Virant, who played no part in the study, said he would anticipate any health concerns would be ""more of an issue in people with pre-existing respiratory disease (asthma, COPD) and/or cardiovascular disease, and especially while exercising."" He added the P-Track device ""seems well-referenced from prior vetted studies."" Kennedy noted that ""ultrafine particles or even nanoparticles"" are a ""great concern for health."" If an ultrafine particle is made up of something toxic, the likelihood of it interacting with a cell in your body is greater.  Although anyone exposed to these particles is affected, people predisposed to cardiovascular disease or with pulmonary conditions, including asthma, are most at risk. ""We know heavy fuel oil has harmful constituents in it,"" said Ulrich of Stand.earth. ""We know that there are higher rates of asthma among children in port communities.""

2017-11-03 15:12:00,2017,11.0,3,Urban Planners Are Designing Cities Resilient to Vehicle Attacks," A year ago, I wrote about architects building schools and offices to protect against mass shootings. After the terrorist attack on Tuesday in New York City, when a man rented a truck and barreled down a bike lane to kill as many pedestrians as possible, leaving eight dead and another dozen injured, I went back with more questions.  Vehicular attacks seem to be an increasingly popular method of destruction—we've seen them recently in Stockholm, Nice, London and Barcelona. Turns out there are design solutions that can help—in this weekend's NYC marathon, police officials are already ramping up security—but some of these fixes come with the risk of turning the city into an uncomfortable fortress, or ramping up mass surveillance.   ""There are certainly urban infrastructure approaches that are imperative to tackling the broader issue of vehicular violence—and many cities, New York included, are having those conversations,"" said Michael Berkowitz, president of 100 Resilient Cities, an organization that works on infrastructure solutions for urban centers.  Gabe Klein, co-author of  Start-Up City, told me there are some road safety measures that can help. First, planners could focus on removing vehicles altogether from high-traffic pedestrian zones. Installing remote-controlled bollards—short posts—he said, could also help keep a barrier in between cars and people, and can be moved for ambulances or police.  In Sweden, where a similar vehicular attack killed five people in April, city planners have put up more physical barriers like blocks and stone lions in the streets. Now, the infrastructure minister said cities like Stockholm may use geofencing, virtual barriers that usually rely on GPS systems, to monitor areas of the city.  And these barriers don't always have to be as obvious—as I reported in my earlier piece, rain gardens, ponds, and bridges can also help create natural barriers, while retaining a sense of calm for people using the space.  But it's not just stopping a rogue vehicle that is important. Klein said the cars themselves need to be reconsidered and regulated, and that cities should only allow automated, low speed, lightweight electric vehicles in their centers. Larger trucks for deliveries could be allowed only at night, as some cities in Europe have done.  ""Vehicles are generally out of scale for cities,"" said Klein, who was also former transportation commissioner in DC and Chicago. ""Trucks and SUVs have been an arms race for size and weight to protect the passengers.""  But everyone I talked to also agreed that urban planning could only do so much when it comes to attacks. And building cities to be defensive could also make them feel suffocating, with too many physical reminders about the risk of attack. There's also the concern that technological solutions like geofencing and sensors create new types of mass surveillance.  ""No infrastructure is going to negate the ability for a maniac to cause collateral damage unless we want to dramatically change the way our streets work,"" Klein said, ""and this would likely have significantly negative impacts on quality of life.""  Meanwhile, Aaron Betsky, dean of the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture in Arizona, told me it was a ""social and political issue,"" not one for architects to solve.   It's also important to note that the attack in New York happened in an already-protected bike lane. While there aren't heavy physical barriers between the road and the lane in that part of Manhattan, this was still an organized roadway that took bikers and walkers into account, not one of the many other roads where bicycles have to weave through car traffic because there are no lanes.  It's not up to urban planners and designers to protect us against terrorist attacks or violence, but it's clear that many elements of how we create the spaces where we live and work can contribute to our safety. A city that's designed to promote resilience rather than fear will always work in our favor.  ""What we saw earlier this week in New York was the strength of the city's social resilience, "" Berkowitz said. ""The response to the attack was swift by the authorities and order was kept. Hours later, thousands of New Yorkers were celebrating Halloween just a mile away from the attack.""

2017-10-20 14:00:00,2017,10.0,20,This Is What Addiction Was Like Before it Became a White-People Problem,"Once upon a less-humane time, folks struggling with drug and alcohol addiction were characterized as criminals, called ""junkies"" and ""low-lives,"" and considered broken, dangerous, and responsible for the impending downfall of society. Two decades ago, political careers and nightly news broadcasts were bolstered by aggressive responses to what was then viewed as a plague—a moral deficit affecting those people. To stamp out this scourge, newly militarized police departments teamed up with the Justice Department to swoop down and save the day with S.W.A.T. gear, draconian policies, and at the very least—scathing rhetoric. But things are different now. The fruitless War on Drugs rages on, but now that the struggle has outgrown inner cities and reached rural and Middle America, sympathy, abundant resources, and an aversion to criminalization are en vogue. Imagine that. Police departments (well, some of them) are shifting from zero-tolerance policies and jailing those in need of help towards directing them to rehabilitation programs and facilities. Anti-overdose drugs are even becoming mandatory for first responders to carry, yielding new opportunities to save lives instead of condemning them. Oh, the humanity. ""While the country is having this great epiphany, there are still countless communities that have been devastated by harsh, draconian policy,"" says Kassandra Frederique, New York State director for the Drug Policy Alliance. ""Moving from a criminal-justice approach to a public-health one regarding drug use, with a lesser role of law enforcement, is something that people have been advocating for for decades."" Frederique considers the recent progress we've made ""a reaffirmation that white lives matter more."" We asked people who battled dependency before the national push towards a kinder War on Drugs how they feel about the softening, newly sympathetic approach to abuse and addiction. Bruce ""Blue"" Rivera, 36, New York City I got heavy into drugs while working as a promoter at the Tunnel, this huge nightclub where you'd see the biggest rappers on any given night. Initially, getting high was just part of the culture. It was just one of those things. We were ""candy flipping"" (taking LSD and ecstasy together) and that worked until I had a bad acid trip. Then I got put onto taking ecstasy and Special K [ketamine] together, which was the best and worst thing to happen to me. I was fucking up at work, late all the time, and not handling my responsibilities. I was 30 pounds lighter than when I left the military. The shit wasn't cool. Now, you can laugh at Snoop and Martha Stewart being high on TV, but before, we weren't laughing at it and people were having their lives ruined over shit like the Rockefeller Laws. There was no rehab for me. We didn't have that. You had to fight and struggle and your mama probably slapped the shit out of you if she found out you were high. Things were different. There was no, 'Let's go to this nice place and hug and talk about our feelings.' Before, [when you were in recovery,] you were demonized. Now, you're celebrated. Pamela Roderick, 63, Stockton, CA My heroin abuse started in the 70s. I was attending the local junior college and met two brothers. The youngest brother almost immediately offered cocaine, so we started getting high together. Long story short, I was eventually introduced to a third brother who was the major drug dealer of the family. He manipulated me with heroin and money and I fell in the trap. I was 21 with no street smarts. Before I knew, it I was hooked like a dog. I wasn't able to get away from him until he went to prison. No one cared when drugs and death were contained in the slums. When black and latino people were overdosing and committing crimes because of drugs, this created jobs—more jails, prisons, courts, probation officers, and parole officers. Way back in the 50s, 60s, and 70s, hard drugs were mainly a ghetto thing. No one cared, but when white middle class kids began to get more involved, it began to change the face of addiction. All of a sudden, diversion programs popped up, alternatives to jail time began, programs and treatment centers abounded. Joan Stringer, 74, Detroit, MI I was on cocaine. I had a friend whose house we'd go by and sniff cocaine and it just grew from there until I needed it. Cocaine makes you feel marvelous. That's why so many people get hooked. I'm a rapper. I go under the name Grandma Rap. One time, I was performing for this family during the holidays. When they called me [to the stage], my buddy and I had gone into the bathroom to get a quick hit, and as I was walking up, I passed out. I woke up in the hospital. I had had a stroke and it paralyzed me on one side. That stuff is horrible. [It] messes you up real bad. Back then, when they used heroin and crack and you saw it on the news at night, it was so ugly. They had some programs but we didn't know about them. My sister was using heroin. Wasn't nobody reaching out to her. They didn't have no support for these people. But they're taking care of them now cause they don't just look like us now. It's everywhere. Times changed, I guess. James Stringer, 54, Detroit, MI I joined the Navy when I was 17 and came back to Detroit on recruiting duty at 22. I was the top recruiter in Michigan and had a government vehicle in my driveway. I had a real bad car accident in my government vehicle while en route to pick up a recruit, and first tried cocaine while I was on leave for 90 days at home with 300 stitches. Later on, I was one of the best supervisors on a Navy ship in Jacksonville. I was in college full-time and dealing with this addiction. I was getting all this praise but I was doing crack when I was named Recruiter of the Year. They have all those programs and treatment options and stuff now because these white girls in the suburbs are hooked on narcotics and pills and now it's a catastrophe. But it's been in our community for 40 years. It's a different time now. The support hasn't really changed. People just know more now. Things evolve and people evolve with them. The attitude and the treatment should be the same for everyone, whether you're an old black man with a heroin addiction or a young white girl in her mother's cabinet looking for Percocet. Even though the perception has changed and my experience was not like it would be now, I'm not angry about none of that. This stuff has been around a while, but we're just learning how to really deal. Brian Broome, 40-ish, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania When I started using drugs, it was club drugs, like cocaine and ecstasy. Everyone was doing them and I actually used them the most with people in academia. But, it was viewed as classy and sophisticated. We would do it at parties and then everyone would talk about academic stuff. When I started scouring the streets is when it got ugly. When I had to go to ""bad neighborhoods"" and housing projects. Then heroin came on the scene and my first person [a white friend] died. And everyone was so sad because he ""had so much potential."" But they blamed the drug and not him. They blamed the drug. That's the difference, if you ask me. When it's white people, they blame the drug and when it's black people they blame a faulty character. I go to Narcotics Anonymous meetings now and there is always a white kid who's addicted, who shows up with a parent. The parents blame ""Mexicans."" This is why they want to build a wall.

2019-04-05 00:00:00,2019,4.0,5,"Digital health IPOs coming from Livongo, Change and HealthCatalyst","Investors in digital health have been opening their wallets in recent years, with the promise that the coming together of devices, algorithms and consumers' growing obsession with personal health data will translate into big business. They're finally poised to see some of the rewards, as the IPO market appears ready to crack open. Livongo, a Silicon Valley provider of services and tools that help people manage chronic medical conditions, has reportedly picked bankers for its IPO, as has HealthCatalyst, a health-care data company. Change Healthcare, which provides technology to bring down the costs of health care, filed its prospectus last month. In 2018, health-tech start-ups raised more than $8 billion, but the only significant exits came from a few acquisitions, like Roche's purchase of Flatiron Health for almost $2 billion and Amazon's $1 billion acquisition of online pharmacy PillPack. For investors to keep putting in capital, they need companies to not only go public but also to impress financially once they debut. ""To have a well-funded digital heath company performing well and going public, it validates the digital health thesis,"" said Blake Wu, a health investor at venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates. Wu's investments include Bright Health, a provider of affordable health insurance, and Pager, a digital health platform that helps consumers connect with providers. To date, most of the notable IPOs in the health-tech market have been from companies with business models that are familiar to Wall Street. For example, Veeva Systems and AthenaHealth sell cloud-based software and Fitbit sells devices. Digital health companies in the current IPO pipeline are different, in that they emphasize the combination of technology and services, which might include app-based behavioral coaching or nudges toward promoting healthy behavior. Livongo, which was founded 2014, built its business by working with large companies like Amazon, Microsoft, PepsiCo, Walgreens and Delta, to provide technology that employees with diabetes can use to monitor and manage their disease. The package includes a connected glucose meter and unlimited lancets and test strips, and the company offers coaching and tips through its apps to help people stay healthy, which might result in cost savings for the employers footing the bill. Livongo has expanded its offerings beyond diabetes management to serve people with high blood pressure and mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety. It will take time for public market investors to see if this type of business model can generate predictable revenue and lead to sustained profitability, said Marc Albanese, senior director of research at CB insights, a research and strategy firm. ""There hasn't be a true digital health IPO, "" Albanese said. ""So there is a bit of pressure on Livongo."" Most investors specialize in health or technology businesses, but not both. ""Livongo is truly a cross between health and tech,"" said Albanese. ""Its performance will set the tone for how similar companies are received, which makes it so important."" Livongo is on track to generate more than $100 million in revenue this year, up from $70 million in 2018, and its technology is used by more than 120,000 employees, according to a person with knowledge of the company's financials who asked not to be named because the numbers are confidential. Livongo hired Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan Chase to manage its IPO, the Wall Street Journal reported last month. A Livongo spokesperson declined to comment on its IPO plans. Digital health research firm Rock Health is ready for the floodgates to open. In a recent report, the company said that while funding will moderate in the early part of 2019, ""the end of the digital health IPO drought comes into sight.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/05/digital-health-ipos-coming-from-livongo-change-and-healthcatalyst.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,607

Flight bookings were down 10 percent as of Aug. 27, after being up 11 percent as of Aug. 19, the day Florida confirmed that the mosquito-borne Zika virus was active in Miami, according to the report. (bit.ly/2bXVlfk) Bookings for the Thanksgiving period from solo travelers and small family-like groups of two-four members fell the most, the study found. According to the ForwardKeys study, trips with Miami as the sole destination were strongly affected, whereas there was no impact on bookings for trips that included the city and other destinations. There was little impact on flight bookings for September, October and Christmas, the report found. American Airlines Group Inc, the largest carrier in Miami, and rival JetBlue Airways Corp, were not immediately available for comment. Leisure airfares to the greater Miami area have inched down while fewer hotel rooms have been booked in downtown Miami in the weeks since the Zika virus was detected there, Reuters reported last month. Last month, Florida announced four new cases of Zika in the Wynwood neighborhood, where officials have been aggressively spraying for the mosquitoes that carry the virus for weeks. The current Zika outbreak was first detected in Brazil last year and has since spread across the Americas, Singapore and Malaysia. In Brazil, Zika has been linked to more than 1,800 cases of microcephaly, and U.S. officials expect as many as 270 cases in Puerto Rico, where local transmission of the virus is widespread.

2018-06-07 00:00:00,2018,6.0,7,Philip Morris plans to target Indian smokers with iQOS device: sources,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N) is planning to launch its iQOS smoking device in India, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, as the tobacco giant seeks a foothold in a country with the world’s second-biggest smoker population. Philip Morris says the sleek, penlike iQOS heats but does not burn tobacco, producing a nicotine-containing vapour rather than smoke and making it less harmful than conventional cigarettes. The company says it wants to one day stop selling cigarettes altogether. India has stringent laws to deter tobacco use, which the government says kills more than 900,000 people every year. But the country still has 106 million adult smokers, second only to China according to the World Health Organization (WHO), making it a lucrative market for Philip Morris to target. A government source said New Delhi would keep an “open mind” if Philip Morris approached it to discuss a device that helped people quit smoking, but added such devices, including e-cigarettes, could be banned if found to be harmful. The health ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Philip Morris plans to start strategising an iQOS launch in India, which would include work on branding and pricing, as well as reaching out to media and regulators, sources aware of the plan said. The company’s top corporate affairs executive in India, R. Venkatesh, has been interviewing candidates for a senior executive who would focus on iQOS, the sources said. The company wants “to put together a strategy to achieve its acceptability as a reduced risk product”, said one of the sources, adding that Philip Morris wanted to have a public relations strategy in place before moving ahead. A Philip Morris spokesman said “we do not comment on our launch plans, but are committed to working hard to replace cigarettes with scientifically substantiated smoke-free products”. Venkatesh did not respond to a request for comment. But the company appears to have already started building a public case for iQOS in India. On “World No Tobacco Day” last week, Venkatesh wrote a column for India’s Economic Times newspaper, calling for “effective regulations” for alternative smoking devices. “With alternatives to cigarettes available and countries already delivering on their smoke-free ambitions, the incentive is there for lawmakers to support Indian smokers - who deserve a better option,” Venkatesh said. Prakash C. Gupta, director at the Healis Sekhsaria Institute of Public Health near Mumbai, criticized Philip Morris’ plans, saying iQOS would be used by affluent young people in India “which will be harmful for public health”. Philip Morris has for years promoted its Marlboro cigarettes in India. Though its market share has quadrupled in recent years, Marlboro still accounts for only about 1.4 percent of India’s $10 billion cigarette market. According to internal documents published by Reuters last year, the company sees India as a “high potential market” where it aimed at “winning the hearts and minds” of people between 18, the minimum legal age to buy tobacco products, and 24. IQOS is currently used by nearly 5 million people in more than 30 countries, led by Japan which effectively bans regular e-cigarettes but allows “heat not burn” devices. India could offer Philip Morris a huge opportunity due to its burgeoning middle class, said Shane MacGuill, head of tobacco research at Euromonitor International. “It’s a bet on the future,” MacGuill said. “In the longer term, there could be very big rewards for them in India.” Philip Morris’ so-called reduced risk products, such as iQOS, helped the company clock $3.8 billion in net revenues last year, compared with $739 million in the previous year. To garner support for iQOS in India, Philip Morris plans to reach out to influential people who could voice public support for the device ahead of its launch, two of the sources said. Still, if Philip Morris seeks Indian approvals, it would need to convince a government that has in recent years raised cigarette taxes, ordered companies to print bigger health warnings on tobacco packs and launched a quit-smoking helpline. Philip Morris has also applied to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for permission to market the device as being less harmful than cigarettes. Dr. Vinayak M. Prasad, who leads WHO’s tobacco-free initiative in Geneva, said the agency had advised those governments that had consulted it that it had no evidence to show products such as iQOS were less harmful than conventional forms of tobacco. “These products should be regulated, not allowed to be used in public places that are smoke-free and taxed sufficiently high enough to deter young people to get addicted,” Prasad told Reuters on Friday. To view a graphic on Philip Morris iQOS, click: tmsnrt.rs/2JwvlJl India’s health ministry has for years said it wants to regulate e-cigarettes - devices which use a nicotine-laced liquid. Still, there is no federal regulation for the product that activists say is harmful and acts as a gateway to tobacco. In a filing to a Delhi court that is hearing a plea to regulate e-cigarettes, the federal health ministry in April described such Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) as “new emerging threats”. The ministry, in its filing seen by Reuters, said it was developing guidelines for regulating - including possibly banning - the manufacture, import or sale of e-cigarettes. “Glamorizing marketing techniques of ENDS as less harmful products purely mimics the marketing techniques used by the cigarette industry,” the ministry said, without specifically mentioning heat-not-burn smoking devices such as iQOS. Despite that stance, the government source said the health ministry was still undecided on whether to ban or regulate e-cigarettes, and wanted more consultation to decide whether their efficacy as an aid to help people stop smoking regular cigarettes outweighed any potential harm. Globally, Philip Morris also lobbies regulators to not classify iQOS as a regular cigarette, an argument that, if won, can lead to lower taxes. The company says the tobacco plugs inserted into the iQOS do not produce smoke, and the device itself is an electronic product. It plans to do the same in India. “The first thing is to ensure the customs duties are not prohibitively high,” said one of the sources.

2019-11-26 17:38:00,2019,11.0,26,NSO Employees Take Legal Action Against Facebook for Banning Their Accounts,"On Tuesday, lawyers representing current and former employees of Israeli surveillance contractor NSO Group took legal action against Facebook to try and get their accounts reinstated after being banned by the social media giant. Last month, Facebook itself sued NSO in California for leveraging a vulnerability in the WhatsApp chat program that NSO Group clients used to hack targets. As part of that, Facebook also banned the personal Facebook and Instagram accounts of multiple current and former NSO employees. The new lawsuit argues that Facebook violated its own terms of service by blocking the NSO employees, and it used personal information they shared with Facebook in order to identify them, in violation of an Israeli privacy law. As relief, the lawyers ask the court to make Facebook lift the ban on the accounts. The lawsuit was first reported in Israeli media. ""It appears that Facebook used the [NSO employees'] personal data...in order to identify them as NSO employees (or former employees), in service of imposing 'collective punishment' on them, in the form of blocking their personal accounts,"" the lawsuit reads in Hebrew. The lawsuit argues that the personal data used to identify them as NSO employees belonged to the individuals, and not Facebook. Lawyers representing the current and former NSO employees were not immediately available to comment. The legal action says that the NSO employees were banned without warning even though they are ""private people, who make private use of the social networks, whose only 'sin' was any association with NSO, as employees or former employees"" The lawsuit includes a screenshot of an email Facebook allegedly sent to someone who had their account suspended. ""This account has been disabled relating to litigation with NSO Group,"" the email reads. Facebook's own lawsuit was in response to NSO's product using a vulnerability in WhatsApp. NSO clients used the technique to target over 1,400 WhatsApp users, including activists, lawyers, and human rights defenders, according to researchers at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto's Munk School, who helped WhatsApp with its investigation. While NSO markets its products as tools to combat terrorism and serious crime, researchers have repeatedly found NSO's products being used to hack journalists and activists, from Mexico, to Saudi Arabia, to the United Arab Emirates. WhatsApp previously told Motherboard that some of the 1,400 targeted users were also instances of states spying on other states. Facebook told Motherboard in a statement on Tuesday, ""In October we filed a legal complaint which attributed a sophisticated cyber attack to the NSO Group and its employees that was directed at WhatsApp and its users in violation of our terms of service and U.S. law. Such actions warranted disabling relevant accounts and continue to be necessary for security reasons, including preventing additional attacks."" Facebook did not immediately respond when asked if there is evidence suggesting NSO employees used their personal accounts to mount attacks. NSO said in a statement ""We’re proud of the work our employees do every day to help governments save lives around the globe. As far as this lawsuit is concerned, this is an independent action by NSO Group employees."" Update: This piece has been updated to include a statement from NSO Group.

2018-05-02 00:00:00,2018,5.0,2,Iowa abortion ban: Law restricts abortions as soon as a fetal heartbeat is detected," (CNN)The Republican-led legislature in Iowa has passed a bill that, if signed into law, will become the nation's most restrictive abortion ban: It forbids doctors from performing the procedure after a fetal heartbeat is detected.  In many cases, that can happen as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women even know they're expecting. Right now, Iowa bars most abortions after 20 weeks, already making it one the most restrictive states. But Senate File 359, or the ""heartbeat bill,"" ups the ante.  And it's most certainly going to be challenged in court, opponents say. In 2013, North Dakota passed a similar law that banned abortions after six weeks. The case made its way to the US Supreme Court, where it was blocked permanently. ""By passing an intentionally unconstitutional bill, Iowa Republicans have declared that they do not care about the foundational values of our state, or Iowa's future,"" Planned Parenthood Voters of Iowa said.  ""They do not care how much taxpayer money will be spent on a lawsuit.""  Lawmakers know it will lead to a legal fight Many lawmakers who support the ""heartbeat bill"" hope it does lead to a legal battle that winds its way to the highest court of the land. Emboldened by the court's makeup, they think it will help overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision by the Supreme Court that legalized the right to an abortion in all 50 states.  ""This bill will be the vehicle that will ultimately provide change and provide the opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade,""  Sen. Rick Bertrand, a Republican, said during the floor debate. ""There's nothing hidden here about the agenda."" The Iowa legislation has some exemptions, such as in the case of rape or incest or if a woman's life is at risk. The bill doesn't call for criminal prosecution of a woman getting an abortion, but doesn't include language about what happens to doctors who flout the law.  The bill now goes to Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, who hasn't said whether she will sign it. But her spokeswoman told CNN: ""Gov. Reynolds is 100% pro-life and will never stop fighting for the unborn.""

2020-02-01 00:00:00,2020,2.0,1,"As coronavirus misinformation spreads on social media, Facebook removes posts","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) said it will take down misinformation about China’s fast-spreading coronavirus, in a rare departure from its usual approach to dubious health content that is presenting a fresh challenge for social media companies. The coronavirus outbreak has stoked a wave of anti-China sentiment around the globe. Hoaxes have spread widely online, promoted by conspiracy theorists and exacerbated by a dearth of information from the cordoned-off zone around China’s central city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began. Nearly 12,000 people have been infected in China, according to local health authorities, and more than 130 cases reported in at least 25 other countries and regions. Facebook said in a blog post that it would remove content about the virus “with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities,” saying such content would violate its ban on misinformation leading to “physical harm.” The move is unusually aggressive for the world’s biggest social network, which generally limits the distribution of content containing health misinformation to its 2.9 billion monthly users through restrictions on search results and advertising, but allows the original posts to stay up. It also puts it at odds with other major U.S.-based social networks. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) YouTube, which has 2 billion monthly users and Twitter (TWTR.N) and Reddit, which have hundreds of millions of users, confirmed they do not consider inaccurate information about health to be a violation of their policies. Those companies, like Facebook in other cases, rely on techniques such as elevating medical information from authoritative public health sources and warning users about content that has been debunked. TikTok, owned by China’s Bytedance, and Pinterest Inc (PINS.N) do ban health misinformation and are actively removing false coronavirus content, they told Reuters. Fact-checking initiative PolitiFact said misinformation about the virus online included hoaxes about its source, its spread, and how to treat it, as well as false conspiracies about its connection to biological warfare and the Chinese government. Rumors about the coronavirus have also spread widely on Chinese social networks, which are usually quick to remove sensitive content but have in recent days allowed an unusual level of public criticism over the government’s handling of the crisis. Information in China is tightly controlled, and Chinese laws dictate that rumor-mongers can face years in prison. In the early days of the outbreak, Chinese state media reported that police in Wuhan had detained eight people for spreading rumors about a “local outbreak of unidentifiable pneumonia.” Suspicion also lingers over accusations that Beijing initially covered up the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. A spokeswoman for Tencent Holdings Inc’s (0700.HK) Chinese messaging app WeChat, which has 1.15 billion monthly users, told Reuters the company was removing posts containing coronavirus-related misinformation. The U.S. tech industry’s mostly hands-off approach has angered critics who say social media companies have failed to curb the spread of medical inaccuracies that pose major global health threats. In particular, misinformation about vaccination has proliferated on social media in many countries in recent years, including during major vaccination campaigns to prevent polio in Pakistan and to immunize against yellow fever in South America. Facebook, under fierce scrutiny worldwide in recent years over its privacy and content practices, has previously removed vaccine misinformation in Samoa, where a measles outbreak killed dozens late last year. The spread of illness there was so severe that the company classified anti-vaccination content a risk of physical harm, a spokeswoman told Reuters, calling the move an “extreme action.” The coronavirus and Samoa decisions indicate Facebook is expanding its definition of “physical harm” to include misinformation contributing to the rapid spread of illness. The company did not say whether it had acted in a similar way in other cases. It removed misinformation about polio vaccines in Pakistan, but the imminent harm in that case involved risks of violence against the health workers carrying out the immunization campaigns, the spokeswoman said.

2019-09-18 18:00:00,2019,9.0,18,"Asteroid Dust Could Help Cool the Climate, Scientists Say","Dust from a cataclysmic asteroid collision that occurred beyond the orbit of Mars some 468 million years ago may have helped trigger an ice age and an explosion of biodiversity in life on Earth. This finding, published on Wednesday in Science Advances, is a mind-boggling example of how events in outer space can exert a major influence on the climate and evolutionary history of our planet. Led by Birger Schmitz, a professor of geology at Lund University in Sweden, the study’s authors demonstrate how asteroid dust can cause global climate cooling, and even suggest that this type of debris could be one potential solution to human-driven climate change. Scientists have long debated the potential drivers behind the great Ordovician biodiversification event (GOBE), which began about 466 million years ago. The number of marine invertebrate families tripled during this period of global cooling, and complex animals such as brachiopods, gastropods, and bivalves dominated the oceans. (At this point, life had not yet diversified on land). The violent breakup of a 100-mile wide asteroid, called the L chondrite parent body, sprinkled Earth’s atmosphere with debris. We are, in fact, still living through the aftermath of this collision, as nearly a third of meteorites that end up on Earth are thought to originate from the L chondrite body, according to the study. This cosmic collision may have ushered in a period of global cooling by filtering out sunlight, which in turn caused sea levels to drop as ice formed at the poles. Climate change can be devastating to life on Earth, but since this cooling trend was relatively gradual, it may have stimulated adaptation and opened up vast new niches, triggering the GOBE. This idea that a slow dose of environmental stress and change can be a catalyst for biodiversity is called the “intermediate disturbance hypothesis.” According to Schmitz, this cosmic phenomenon may even be responsible for other ice ages throughout Earth’s history. “We are of course also interested to see whether any of the other major ice age episodes, like Snowball Earth, perhaps were triggered by asteroid dust,” he said in an email. The collision theory is compelling, but scientists have previously disputed the conclusion that the asteroid dust cloud and the GOBE sync up in the fossil record. A 2017 study in Nature Communications suggested that the biodiversity boost was already well underway when the first dust arrived at Earth, challenging the idea that the events were related. Schmitz and his colleagues set out to look for remnants of this extraterrestrial debris shower in the marine limestone deposits of Kinnekulle in southern Sweden and the Lynna River near St. Petersburg, Russia. Their goal was to establish a much more precise timeline that pinpointed when, in the limestone record, a sudden spike in space dust appears, and if it correlates to the emergence of more numerous and complex forms of marine life. The team identified these tiny grains as originating from the L chondrite parent body by comparing them to micrometeorites from Antarctica. The results showed that the L chondrite debris after the breakup caused a thousand-fold increase in space dust falling to Earth that lasted for at least two million years. The team also provided evidence that “extraordinary amounts of L-chondritic micrometeorites” had arrived hundreds of thousands of years earlier than suggested in the 2017 study. As a result, the researchers said the extended fallout of the collision coincides with the explosion of life seen in the fossil record, and could have been a major driver of it. In addition to cooling the climate, this dust may have seeded the oceans with valuable extraterrestrial fertilizer that fed the sudden biodiversity boost. “This type of extraterrestrial dust is very rich in iron,” Schmitz said. “When dust passes through the atmosphere it ablates because of friction, and very tiny iron-rich particles, on the nanometer scale, are liberated and then settle on the ocean surface.” “Large parts of the ocean have enough of other nutrients, but lack the essential iron,” he added. If this alien iron nourished these ancient marine animals, then it may have also caused an increase in biological carbon dioxide storage in the oceans. Both the atmospheric shading caused by space dust and the enhanced bioproductivity from marine organisms could have played a role in reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide and cooling the climate. According to Schmitz, nailing this down could open up some far-out possibilities for countering the climate crisis with geoengineering. “It would be extremely important to figure out whether [carbon dioxide] drawdown because of fertilizing iron and increased bioproductivity or dust-shading is the more important parameter that leads to cooling,” Schmitz said. “Such knowledge may be crucial if we will have to mitigate a catastrophic global warming by geoengineering (provided politicians fail to bring down [carbon dioxide] emissions).” The team close the study by citing one speculative geoengineering scenario that would involve gravitationally mooring an asteroid to the first Lagrange point, which is a stable location one million miles from our planet, in the direction of the Sun. Earth would be peppered with dust from this space rock, which could “create a prolonged cooling effect,” the authors said in the study. Of course, any geoengineering solutions to the climate crisis would require meticulous research and public debate to mitigate the risk of accidentally exacerbating global destabilization. But given how asteroids have been implicated in local and global extinctions, it’s interesting to consider the role that these extraterrestrial objects have played in stimulating and protecting life on Earth.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vb53mb/asteroid-dust-could-help-cool-the-climate-scientists-say,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,918

2020-03-18 00:00:00,2020,3.0,18,Coronavirus: How the crisis can lead to telemedicine adoption,"In the midst of crisis, the U.S. health system is dramatically changing.  Doctors have been told by the federal government that they can have a FaceTime or Skype call with seniors enrolled in Medicare. Hospitals are setting up chatbots, symptom checkers and telemedicine tools virtually overnight to triage patients so the healthy ones can stay home. Some providers have transitioned almost entirely to virtual consults, and hospitals are offering training sessions for those who aren't yet using telemedicine in their practice.  For many of them, including the UC San Francisco cardiologist Ethan Weiss, the experience has been a pleasant surprise.  Telemedicine was ""waaaaaaaaay better than I thought,"" he told CNBC.  Weiss, who previously saw the vast majority of his patients in person, said he could see himself introducing more telemedicine into his practice going forward. It would make a big difference, he said, if regulators approved more tools for clinicians to conduct remote examinations. That would mean many of his less complicated cases could be seen virtually, which could free him up to spend time with his most vulnerable patients.  Health-tech experts say that a new front door for medicine has emerged in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Instead of booking an appointment with a doctor, patients now have multiple options at their disposal whether it's to get advice via a chatbot or to message a nurse. And providers are are increasingly finding they're getting paid regardless of the method of communication. For Silicon Valley, it's a welcome change. Countless technology entrepreneurs have tried to move medicine to embrace digital and consumer tools for years. But many of them say they have faced immense resistance from the health care industry. The status quo is highly lucrative for many stakeholders. The big fear is that technology companies like Google and Amazon, along with a slew of venture-backed start-ups, will come in and upend their businesses, while targeting their healthiest and most profitable patients.  Some of the concerns about technology companies are very legitimate, and include fears around protecting patient privacy or the potential liability for doctors. We still have some important questions to work through, such as whether a chatbot company is responsible for giving bad advice to a patient. And some of the approaches from the start-up world aren't designed to make the lives of physicians easier. They inundate doctors with endless streams of data, or flout regulations in the quest for growth.  But entrepreneurs generally say the current system needs to adapt to the modern age. They note that even simple changes that benefit the average American, like getting medical record companies to share a patient's chart between hospitals or allowing pharmacists to talk to their patients about more affordable medication options, have taken years to remedy. And consumers are increasingly footing the bill for medical services, with the rise of high deductible plans, so they're expecting a better experience.  ""It was too hard to satisfy all the stakeholders, payers, patients (and) doctors,"" said Jordan Michaels, recalling his own experience running a start-up called Ringadoc. His company, which developed software for doctors and patients to communicate virtually, sold to a medical record provider in 2014.  According to Michaels, one of the biggest challenges to innovating in health care was that stakeholders weren't exactly rushing to step up and do things differently. In theory, they all wanted to embrace ideas like ""consumerism,"" ""patient engagement,"" and ""price transparency,"" but no one wanted to go first. One particular challenge for companies like Ringadoc involved getting a health plan to agree to reimburse for a new technology, so that doctors would get adequately paid. Michaels, who is now a vice president at the consumer-focused medication company GoodRx, was left wondering: ""Who was going to be the one to give in and do something they didn't want to do?"" Another big problem for technology companies was to get consumers aware of these new options. It's hard to inspire people to think deeply about their health care options when they're not sick. Even the largest companies like Google and Microsoft have struggled to scale tools that make it easier for people to aggregate their medical information. Google Health shut down in 2014 due to lack of traction, and Microsoft HealthVault ended its service last year. So companies building digital medicine tools never really had their moment in the sun, where people were widely introduced to the new options.  Neal Khosla, who runs a virtual medicine startup called Curai, said that the day has come where digital health is showing its usefulness to patients and the medical community. Public health authorities are advising patients to see their doctors remotely if they suspect they have symptoms of COVID-19, or need medical help for many other reasons. It reduces the chance of people getting infected by the virus if they can stay home.  Khosla said that these changes could become permanent if companies in the space do their jobs right in this critical period. ""Right now I think most health systems are scaling telehealth and a bunch of operations without regards for their bottom line because they have to,"" he said. ""But what's going to happen when the emergency ends and they go back?"" Khosla said. ""At the end of the day, I think some of the law changes will make it tenable to stick with telehealth, and the competitive pressures from patients will help.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/18/coronavirus-how-the-crisis-can-lead-to-telemedicine-adoption.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,898

2019-07-22 00:00:00,2019,7.0,22,Multidrug-resistant malaria spreading in Southeast Asia: study,"LONDON (Reuters) - A strain of malaria resistant to two key drugs has spread rapidly from Cambodia and has become dominant in Vietnam, Laos and northern Thailand, with a “terrifying prospect” that it could reach Africa, scientists warned on Monday, Using gnomic surveillance to track the spread of drug-resistant malaria, the scientists found that the strain, known as KEL1/PLA1, had also evolved and picked up new genetic mutations that may make it yet more resistant. “We discovered (it) had spread aggressively, replacing local malaria parasites, and had become the dominant strain in Vietnam, Laos and northeastern Thailand,” said Roberto Amato, who worked with a team from Britain’s Wellcome Sanger Institute and Oxford University and Thailand’s Mahidol University. The risk is rising that the new strain could threaten sub-Saharan Africa, where most malaria cases and deaths occur, largely among babies and children. “This highly successful resistant parasite strain is capable of invading new territories and acquiring new genetic properties, raising the terrifying prospect that it could spread to Africa ... as resistance to chloroquine did in the 1980s, contributing to millions of deaths,” said Olivo Miotto of Oxford University, who co-led the work. Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are carried by mosquitoes and spread through their blood-sucking bites. Almost 220 million people were infected with malaria in 2017, according to World Health Organization estimates, and 400,000 succumbed to it. Malaria can be treated with medicines if caught early enough, but evolving drug-resistance - such as the spread of chloroquine-resistant malaria across Asia to Africa from the late 1950s to the 1980 - has hampered efforts to eliminate it. The first-line treatment in many parts of Asia in the last decade has been a combination of dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine, also known as DHA-PPQ. Researchers found in previous work that a strain of malaria resistant to this combination had evolved and spread across Cambodia between 2007 and 2013. This latest research, published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, found it had crossed borders and tightened its grip. Miotto said further work was now needed to establish how far this resistance had spread and whether it had evolved further - and eventually to understand which drugs would work against resistant malaria parasites. “Other drugs may be effective at the moment but the situation is extremely fragile,” he said.

2018-04-30 16:02:00,2018,4.0,30,This Russian Company Sells Zero-Day Exploits for Hospital Software," Zero-days—security issues known only to the attacker and not the affected vendor—can be a sought after commodity for researchers, criminals, or governments. But one company is offering zero-days for a set of overlooked targets: medical software, some of which is used in hospitals. The company’s products highlight the often polemic debate between keeping hold of vulnerabilities for offensive purposes and selling them, or disclosing the issues to the affected software vendor so the holes can be fixed. “To disclose is not an obligation,” Yuriy Gurkin from Moscow-based cybersecurity company Gleg, and which is selling the exploits, told Motherboard in an email. Gleg offers several different packs of exploits for clients: Agora covers mainstream web software; the “SCADA+ Pack” is focused on “industrial software and hardware environment” issues, and, predictably, the MedPack includes vulnerabilities for medical software. A one year subscription for MedPack costs $4,000, and for that Gleg provides 25 exploits per year, most of which are zero-days, Gurkin wrote. In one video uploaded to Vimeo, Gleg shows an exploit being used against a hospital health information management system (HHIMS). A list of MedPack updates includes a zero-day to replace files in a piece of software from a company called MediTEX. MediTEX makes scheduling software as well as a platform for documenting therapy and quality assurance for reproductive medicine, according to the company’s website. “We use some products of them in the hospitals too,” Jelena Milosevic, a pediatrician and intensive care unit (ICU) nurse, who has also crossed over into information security, told Motherboard in an email. Gleg’s MedPack exploits are designed to be used with Canvas, a penetration testing tool made by cybersecurity firm Immunity Inc. With this, someone paid to legally scope out how secure a medical centre or hospital is may be able to get a foothold in a target organization. But while those vulnerabilities remain as zero-days, with their details unknown to the vendor, they are still open for others to potentially exploit—something which may concern those in and around the medical industry. “The FDA strongly encourages coordinated disclosure of cybersecurity vulnerability information, which places the health of patients at the forefront,” a spokesperson for the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) told Motherboard in an email. Earlier this month the FDA issued a new plan on medical device safety, which includes medical device cybersecurity. While zero-days for medical software could allow an attacker to gain access to a target, they are typically not how medical organizations are hacked in real world cases, though. “It is likely not from custom exploits but instead older, easily leveraged exploits against legacy OS [operating system] based medical devices/systems,” Jon DiMaggio, senior threat intelligence analyst at Symantec Security Response, which recently published research on a hacker group that gained access to computers controlling X-Ray, MRI and other medical machines, told Motherboard in an email. Indeed, the WannaCry virus, likely the most significant hack that impacted the medical industry, relied on a known and patched exploit in Microsoft Windows—but one that many UK hospitals were not ready for. “Zero-days are obviously a major threat to any industry. However, because the medical industry utilizes older/legacy technologies to implement medical devices/software and tools such as X-Ray and MRI devices, zero-day exploits are likely not necessary to take advantage of these networks/systems,” DiMaggio added. Gurkin from Gleg said the company includes computer emergency response team (CERT) related structures among its customers—groups that typically respond to security incidents within a particular country—so details may eventually reach vendors anyway. And Gleg may disclose medical software vulnerabilities, but “for money of course,” Gurkin added.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5a7p3/russian-company-zero-days-hospital-medical-software,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,597
2018-05-23 00:00:00,2018,5.0,23,HBO producer Frank Rich on Netflix: They 'dump everything out there',"Netflix may be worth a lot more than HBO owner Time Warner, but HBO creative consultant Frank Rich says HBO has Netflix beat as far as quality of content and transparency for creators. ""Our point about HBO is, we don't dump everything out there,"" Rich said on CNBC's ""Squawk Alley."" ""And a lot of Netflix stuff is great, but not all of it."" Rich is probably biased — he's the mastermind behind HBO's critically acclaimed ""Veep"" and upcoming media dynasty drama ""Succession."" But having worked as a producer for HBO, he says HBO offers the kind of transparency creators want, whereas competitor Netflix has a history of keeping producers in the dark. ""In the case of HBO, there is complete communication. We know the number of viewers, we also know the reviews, who is watching, the buzz of it — and that's something HBO can offer television creators,"" Rich said.

2017-12-27 00:00:00,2017,12.0,27,Male doctors make a lot more in industry payments than female peers,"(Reuters Health) - Male physicians in the U.S., across almost every specialty, took in more money from the biomedical industry in 2015 than their female peers, a new study suggests. Researchers analyzed general industry payments, including research grants, consulting fees, and food and beverage expenses, accrued by 933,295 licensed physicians. Overall, they saw a notable gender difference in favor of male physicians in relation to engagement with industry. “These data are depressingly familiar”, said Ariane Hegewisch, program director of employment and earnings at the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for Women’s Policy Research, who was not involved in the study. Two-thirds of the doctors in the study were male. Across all specialties, men received a higher per-physician value of general payments versus women, with a median difference of $1,470. The discrepancy in neurosurgery was particularly wide, with the largest per-physician value of general payments for male neurosurgeons at $15,821, compared with $3,970 for their female colleagues. “At first glance, this finding can be interpreted as merely another example of gender disparities in the workplace, which we have seen before with gender gaps in physician salaries and research funding,” said study coauthor Kathryn Tringale of the University of California, San Diego. The data could also indicate industry bias resulting in fewer opportunities for female physicians to engage in profitable relationships, or gender differences in physician decision-making, Tringale said. Female doctors with children may work fewer hours than their male counterparts, although not every woman physician is a mother, and not every female doctor who is a mother has reduced her hours, noted Hegewisch in an email. “But this is not really a full explanation: why is it that women take so much more responsibility for their kids and for family care overall? Discrimination, access to the highest paying opportunities, and systemic bias in the way funding and patenting systems are set up are also likely to contribute,” she said. The study also found that male physicians held 93% of the value received from ownership interests, including stock options and partnership shares, and received a higher per-physician value across most specialties, with the largest difference among radiologists. However, women physicians in certain fields such as obstetrics, gynecology, psychiatry and urology, had comparatively higher values of ownership interest. “Perhaps industries purposely target men more than women, presuming they may have greater influence on market share or sales . . . data shows that women hold fewer patents than their male counterparts, which may be explained by fewer initial connections to the marketplace or exclusion of their name from the patent itself after idea generation,” Tringale said. Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, suggested what she called another “obvious explanation.” Perhaps “women do less of the work that earns the type of payments being studied,” she said in an email. The study findings were drawn from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services National Plan & Provider Enumeration System and from 2015 Open Payment reports of industry payments to U.S. doctors. In a subset of 63,466 licensed California practitioners, after taking years in practice into account, male physicians were still more likely than female physicians to receive general payments and hold ownership interests, and the men received more - and higher-value - general payments, Tringale and her coauthor Dr. Jona Hattangadi-Gluth wrote in JAMA Internal Medicine. “We need to further investigate how interactions with industry influence physician behavior and impact patient care, which we cannot conclude from these results,” said Tringale.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-physicians-gender-gap/male-doctors-make-a-lot-more-in-industry-payments-than-female-peers-idUSKBN1EL1DZ,Health News,Reuters,health,582
2018-07-25 22:05:00,2018,7.0,25,Why Kim Zolciak Biermann Is Getting Smaller Implants,"Kim Zolciak-Biermann is preparing to go under the knife — again. The Don’t Be Tardy star revealed Wednesday that she’s planning to get smaller breast implants after she asked her fans to cast their votes in a poll on what size they think she should reduce to. “Which one,” Zolciak-Biermann, 40, wrote in an Instagram Story with two implant size options: “Full C [or] DD.” “Thx @kanebiermann for taking this pic of me today!!” the mother of six captioned a photo — snapped by her 4-year-old son, Kane — of herself wearing a strapless red bikini while standing beside a swimming pool. “Lopsided boobs and all (clearly it’s the bathing suit lol) 😂🤣” she wrote. “But thanks you guys for voting on C/DD can’t wait to downsize a little @dr.hochstein 💃🏼💃🏼”
 During her House of Kim podcast on Wednesday, Zolciak-Biermann opened up about her decision to go smaller. “I obviously have implants. I have the largest implants they actually make, but it doesn’t look that big on my body because of just the way I’m built,” she shared. “But, I’m thinking about actually getting my boobs reduced.” “I already called Dr. Hochstein, who did my boobs and tummy a few years ago — he did my hernia repair and my tummy tuck after that, you might as well! And I said, ‘You know, I feel like I should get my boobs reduced. They’re heavy, my posture’s terrible, I’m getting older.’ What do you guys think?” “I was thinking of going from like a DD to like a C. So head on over to my Instagram please and vote: DD or C,” she said. “I’ve actually already had my surgery scheduled in a couple months, but I can always change that.” “I had a lift and I have like the nicest boobs ever. I did breastfeed all of my kids, so ladies, let’s be honest, they were stretched out, loss of volume, pancake nipples,” she explained. “So [Dr. Hochstein] gave me back my 18-year-old chest, which was amazing. He’s the best for that you guys.” “So anyways, let me know. I’m thinking like a C, a full C. I have to have all my clothes altered. I have to buy a size 6 in everything when I could wear a size 2 in tops because of my boobs and then have everything altered. So it’d be nice to just be able to wear something. They’re perky because I had a lift, so it’s not really that, it’s just the weight of them,” said Zolciak-Biermann The Bravo star has been very open about her relationship with plastic surgery in the past, including documenting her breast augmentation on her Bravo reality show. “I will always nip and tuck if I feel the need to do so” Zolciak-Biermann told E! News in 2016. “I’m open about it. I don’t care. You only go around one time, and I especially understand that.” “I had a boob job and I’ve had a hernia fixed,” Zolciak-Biermann explained. “I had a pretty big hernia from the twins, so I said just do a tummy tuck, which is kinda the same thing, just make the skin really tight. But that doesn’t change my size. I’m the same size I was the day I walked into surgery, I’m just a little bit tighter looking.” At the time, she also explained that her tiny frame runs in the family. “A lot is genetics,” she said. “My mom’s very small, I’m tall, I’m 5-8, I do have height on me. My mom is 5-4. But my mom’s been a size 2 her whole life. I’ve been a size 27 jean my whole life.”",https://people.com/health/kim-zolciak-biermann-getting-smaller-breast-implants-downsize/,health,People,health,611

2016-11-20 18:55:13,2016,11.0,20,Microsoft Spends Big to Build a Computer Out of Science Fiction,"SAN FRANCISCO — Microsoft is putting its considerable financial and engineering muscle into the experimental field of quantum computing as it works to build a machine that could tackle problems beyond the reach of today’s digital computers. There is a growing optimism in the tech world that quantum computers, superpowerful devices that were once the stuff of science fiction, are possible — and may even be practical. If these machines work, they will have an impact on work in areas such as drug design and artificial intelligence, as well as offer a better understanding of the foundations of modern physics. Microsoft’s decision to move from pure research to an expensive effort to build a working prototype underscores a global competition among technology companies, including Google and IBM, which are also making significant investments in search of breakthroughs. In the exotic world of quantum physics, Microsoft has set itself apart from its competitors by choosing a different path. The company’s approach is based on “braiding” particles known as anyons — which physicists describe as existing in just two dimensions — to form the building blocks of a supercomputer that would exploit the unusual physical properties of subatomic particles. Leading researchers acknowledge that barriers still remain to building useful quantum machines, both at the level of basic physics and in developing new kinds of software to exploit certain qualities of devices known as qubits that hold out the possibility of computing in ways not possible for today’s digital systems. Unlike conventional transistors, which can be only on or off at any one time, representing a digital 1 or 0, qubits can exist in superposition, or simultaneously in both states. If qubits are placed in an “entangled” state — physically separated but acting as though they are deeply intertwined — with many other qubits, they can represent a vast number of values simultaneously. A quantum computer would most likely consist of hundred or thousands of qubits. Microsoft began funding research in the field in 2005 when it quietly set up a laboratory known as Station Q under the leadership of the mathematician Michael Freedman. Microsoft now believes that it is close enough to designing the basic qubit building block that the company is ready to begin engineering a complete computer, said Todd Holmdahl, a veteran engineering manager who will direct the Microsoft effort. Over the years, he has led various Microsoft projects, including its Xbox video game machine and the yet-to-be-released HoloLens augmented reality system. “Once we get the first qubit figured out, we have a road map that allows us to go to thousands of qubits in a rather straightforward way,” Mr. Holmdahl said. There is still a debate among physicists and computer scientists over whether quantum computers that perform useful calculations will ever be created. A variety of alternative research programs are trying to create qubits using different materials and designs. The Microsoft approach, known as topological quantum computing, is based on a field that took on new energy when this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to three scientists who had done fundamental work in forms of matter that may exist in just two dimensions. Mr. Holmdahl’s project will also include the physicists Leo Kouwenhoven of Delft University, Charles M. Marcus of the University of Copenhagen, David Reilly of the University of Sydney and Matthias Troyer of E.T.H. Zurich. They will all become Microsoft employees as part of the Artificial Intelligence and Research Group that Microsoft recently created under the leadership of one of its top technical employees, Harry Shum. Microsoft’s newly hired physicists say the decision to try to build a topological quantum computer comes after scientific advances made in the last two years that give the scientists growing confidence that the company will be able to create more stable qubits. “The magic recipe involves a combination of semiconductors and superconductors,” Dr. Marcus said. The researchers recently made a “remarkable breakthrough” in their ability to control the materials used to form qubits, he said. Most of the competing approaches involve cooling quantum computers to near absolute zero temperatures. So far, there are relatively few proven algorithms that could be used to solve problems more quickly than today’s digital computers. One early effort, known as Shor’s algorithm, would be used to factor numbers, giving hope that quantum computers might be used in the future for breaking codes. That would potentially have world-shaking consequences because modern electronic commerce is built on cryptographic systems that are largely unbreakable using conventional digital computers. Other proposed approaches might allow faster searching of databases or perform machine learning algorithms, which are being used to make advances in computer vision and speech recognition. More immediately, however, these tools might advance the basic understanding of physics, a possibility the physicist Richard P. Feynman mentioned when he speculated about the idea of a quantum computer in 1982. For his part, Dr. Kouwenhoven said, “My dream application for a quantum computer would be a machine that could solve problems in quantum physics.”",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/technology/microsoft-spends-big-to-build-quantum-computer.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,834
2016-11-30 16:28:00,2016,11.0,30,"Fidel Castro: Tyrant, Revolutionary, and Environmental Crusader","In 1992, Fidel Castro spoke about a radical new idea. During the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, Cuba's president lamented the destruction of nature at the hand of humankind. Less than a decade after scientists had reached a consensus on climate change, Castro was already urging the world to start an environmental revolution. ""The forests are disappearing. The deserts are expanding. Every year billions of tons of fertile soil end up in the sea. Numerous species are becoming extinct,"" he said. ""Population pressures and poverty trigger frenzied efforts to survive even when it is at the expense of the environment. It is not possible to blame the Third World countries for this. Yesterday, they were colonies. Today, they are nations exploited and pillaged by an unjust international economic order."" Since his death last week at the age of 90, Cuba's late-patriarch has been called many things: revolutionary, dictator, savior, and tyrant. And there is evidence for each. But he also seems to have a lesser-known legacy as an environmentalist. Cuba's shining array of biodiversity has earned it the nickname, the ""jewel of the Caribbean,"" and for good reason. The country boasts some of the largest regions of untouched forest, and its oceans are among the most pristine on Earth. Six UNESCO biosphere reserves, including the 1.5 million acre Ciénaga de Zapata Biosphere Reserve, were created to protect the island's unique flora and fauna. And while Cuba's wildness can reasonably be attributed to its economic isolation, Castro's strong influence on the country's environmental legislation has arguably helped to preserve its splendor. In the eyes of Castro, environmental destruction was one of the evils of capitalism. He blamed consumer societies for the desecration of nature that disproportionately harmed the poor and disenfranchised. During a speech on climate change in 2002, Castro regarded Cuba as an example of how humanity's needs can be met ""without destroying nature and basic human values."" (It's important to note here that many Cubans would not agree that their needs are met given the country's food insecurity and other limited resources.) After Castro's Rio de Janeiro speech, Cuba's government amended its constitution to include sweeping environmental provisions that would safeguard land, air, and water resources. In 1994, the Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment—the country's first cabinet-level institution given jurisdiction over environmental issues—was established. Three years later, Cuba's Law 81 of the Environment was decreed to provide a framework for sustainable socioeconomic development. Since then, some 22 percent of Cuba's land is said to be under legal protection. (Approximately 13 percent of land in the United States receives some level of protection.) Logging has decreased while total forest cover has increased. According to government reports, 104 marine protected areas either exist or are coming down the pike. And recently, the country prohibited development within 25 percent of its marine habitats—an astoundingly ambitious goal compared to the 3 to 5 percent cordoned off by the United States, respectively. Today, for those who can get there, Cuba is also a tantalizing hotbed for biological research. ""It's been called an 'accidental Eden,' and some of that's true. The island didn't develop in the same way as its Caribbean neighbors, in part because of the embargo. But in large part, this is also due to the government's affirmative decisions,"" Dan Whittle, the Senior Director of the Environmental Defense Fund's Cuba Program, told me. ""Scientific diplomacy [with Cuba] has been effective throughout a number of administrations,"" Whittle said. ""Cuba's government places a premium on science; high calibre natural sciences, even despite a brain drain. Cuban scientists have been extremely eager to collaborate with American groups."" Yet, as with most aspects of Castro's rule, the truth of the matter is complicated. For example, some Cuban researchers, or ""guerilla scientists,"" say the trade embargo has only suffocated scientific opportunity. With little funding, and even less hope for American collaboration, many of these researchers have bootstrapped their own projects with whatever materials they could find. There's also the argument that Cuba's environmental accomplishments have been more accidental than intentional. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba has witnessed an industrial hibernation of sorts. In lieu of large-scale agriculture, much of Cuba's farming is now practiced sustainably, diminishing the country's overall carbon footprint. And thanks to the United States' travel embargo, the island has also remained relatively immune to commercial development and cruise ship traffic. However, if Cuba's ecological health was indeed accidental, ""then Haiti could be expected to be a verdant ecological paradise, instead of being the most environmentally devastated country in the region, with just a tiny fraction of its forest cover intact,"" Jim Barborak, former program leader at Conservation International, once told National Geographic. Regardless, the strength of Castro's environmental legislation will be tested in years to come, as diplomacy with the United States continues to evolve. Will Cuba's economy be revived at the cost of its natural capital? Or will ecotourism be allowed to flourish instead? Perhaps auspiciously, after relations between Cuba and the United States were most recently normalized, both countries signed agreements to cooperate over the protection of marine and coastal habitats. ""Cuba's now saying that economic development is good for the country's well being, and it plans to pursue it in a sustainable manner,"" Whittle added. ""But it's going to be done with the Cuban government calling all the shots. 'We welcome tourists from the United States, but we're going to do tourism our way.'""

2019-03-07 00:00:00,2019,3.0,7,Many local governments shrug off FDA warning about Canadian drug imports,"Cities and local governments in several states said they will continue to use a Canadian company to offer employees prescription drugs at a highly reduced price, even though federal officials raised safety concerns about the practice last week. The municipalities use CanaRx, which connects their employees with brick-and-mortar pharmacies in Canada, Great Britain and Australia to fill prescriptions. In a letter Thursday to CanaRx, the Food and Drug Administration said the company has sent ""unapproved"" and ""misbranded"" drugs to U.S. consumers, jeopardizing their safety. The FDA urged consumers not to use any medicines from CanaRx, which works with about 500 cities, counties, school districts and private employers to arrange drug purchases. Some of these employers have used the service as far back as 2004. Prices of drugs from overseas pharmacies can be as much as 70 percent lower than what people pay in the U.S. because the costs are regulated by the foreign governments. FDA officials would not explain why they waited more than a decade to act. They acknowledged the agency had no reports of anyone harmed by drugs received through CanaRx. The FDA made its warning as Congress and the Trump administration look into ways to lower drug prices. Last month, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said he has President Donald Trump's backing to start a program to begin importing drugs from Canada for state residents. After DeSantis' comments, White House officials stressed that any such plan must get state and federal approvals. The FDA said that in most cases importing drugs for personal use is illegal, although it very rarely has tried to stop Americans from bringing drugs across the Canadian border. It has not stopped retail stores in Florida that help consumers buy drugs from Canada since 2003. Nine storefronts were raided by FDA officials in 2017, although the FDA has allowed them to continue operating.  Schenectady County in New York, which has worked with CanaRx since 2004, defended its relationship and had no immediate plans to end it, according to Chris Gardner, the county attorney. ""We will wait to see how this plays out, but right now it's status quo,"" Gardner said. He said CanaRx, which is headquartered in Windsor, Ontario, helped the county save $500,000 on drug costs in 2018. About 25 percent of the county's 1,200 workers use the program and get their drugs with no out-of-pocket costs. If they use American pharmacies, they generally have a copayment. ""This is a good program, and on the merits it looks lawful, and they are not doing the terrible things that the FDA is suggesting,"" Gardner said. CanaRx officials denied they were breaking any laws or putting Americans' health at risk. They say they are not an online pharmacy but a broker between brick-and-mortar pharmacies in Canada, Australia and Great Britain and U.S. employees. People can buy drugs via CanaRx only with a prescription from their doctor. The company said it has no plans to stop distributing drugs. ""The FDA's characterizations of the CanaRx business model and operating protocols are completely wrong,"" said Joseph Morris, a Chicago-based lawyer for the company. ""It is not possible to place an order via any CanaRx website; the websites are informational only."" Morris said the FDA notice prompted calls from many municipalities but all so far say they plan to stick with the company. Columbia County, N.Y., has been using CanaRx for about a decade and the savings allows it to offer employees drugs with no out-of-pocket costs instead of paying up to a $40 copay in local pharmacies. ""This is bull,"" Stephen Acciani, an insurance broker who works with the county, said of the FDA crackdown. ""They are not selling unsafe medications."" His recommendation would be for the county, which has more than 600 employees on its health plan, to continue using CanaRx. He noted that employees receive drugs through the mail in their original packaging from manufacturers. Kate Sharry, a benefits consultant to the city of Fall River, Mass., and more than 100 other municipalities in Massachusetts, said, ""It will give some clients pause. How can you not pay attention to this from the FDA?"" But she expects the local governments to stay with CanaRx. Federal health officials under both Republican and Democratic administrations have blocked efforts to legalize importing drugs, saying it's too risky. ""Sometimes a bargain is too expensive,"" said Peter Pitts, a former FDA associate commissioner and president of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, a New York-based nonprofit that receives some of its funding from drugmakers. Pitts, who applauded the FDA action, said it's difficult for consumers to know when their pills from foreign pharmacies don't have the correct potency or ingredients. He said doctors may also not realize a patient's problem stems from issues with the medicine. Instead, the physicians may just change the medication's dosages. He said it is not safe for Americans to buy drugs that are imported through foreign pharmacies. Gabriel Levitt, president of PharmacyChecker.com, a website for U.S. consumers that verifies international pharmacies offering drugs online, said CanaRx is one of the safest ways for Americans to get drugs from legitimate pharmacies in Canada and other industrialized counties. He said the FDA is trying to intimidate CanaRx and its local government clients. ""My biggest fear is they will scare consumers and they won't take their very safe and effective medications because they hear about this bogus warning."" ""The FDA's action, which appears to try and make those programs look unsafe and sinister, seem to have a political and public relations purpose, one that is perfectly allied with the lobbying agenda of drug companies,"" he said. He pointed to testimony by FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb last week — just a day before the CanaRx warning. When asked about importing Canadian drugs, Gottlieb did not mention CanaRx, but he said that people going to a ""brick and mortar"" pharmacy in Canada ""are getting a safe and effective drug. I have confidence in the Canadian drug regulatory system."" He added that his concerns are with online pharmacies. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the industry trade and lobbying group, cheered the FDA action but denied it had any role in it, said spokeswoman Nicole Longo. ""PhRMA supports the FDA's efforts to crack down on organizations that are circumventing its robust safety and efficacy requirements,"" she said. ""Drug importation schemes expose Americans to potentially unsafe, counterfeit or adulterated medicines.""

2017-01-25 00:00:00,2017,1.0,25,Possible liver injury added to label of Biogen MS drug,"(Reuters) - The prescribing label for Biogen Inc’s big-selling oral multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera has been updated to include a warning of potential liver injury that could require hospitalization, the company said on Wednesday. However, the updated label says signs of liver injury resolved when those patients stopped taking the medicine. Tecfidera, the world’s top-selling oral MS treatment, accounts for about a third of Biogen revenue. It had sales of $1.03 billion in the third quarter. The new liver injury information can be found in a warning section under prescribing information on the drug’s website tecfidera.com. Biogen said the label changes were finalized with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Jan. 19. “Clinically significant cases of liver injury have been reported in patients treated with Tecfidera in the postmarketing setting. The onset has ranged from a few days to several months after initiation of treatment with Tecfidera,” the warning reads. A Biogen spokeswoman said there have been 14 cases of liver injury reported out of some 230,000 patients treated with Tecfidera. Symptoms of liver injury include significant elevations above normal of serum aminotransferases and bilirubin, the warning says. While the abnormalities resolved when patients stopped taking the medicine, some cases required hospitalization. None of the reported cases resulted in liver failure, liver transplant, or death, the warning says. Liver enzyme monitoring is standard practice for many multiple sclerosis drugs, so the warning does not represent an added burden for prescribing physicians. It remains to be seen if this tempers enthusiasm for the widely-used medicine or if it will hurt sales. “While this is something to be highlighted to physicians, in my opinion this is not going to materially change market share or future (sales) projections,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, who forecast 2017 Tecfidera sales exceeding $4 billion. “There was already mention of some rare cases of elevated liver enzymes in the initial label,” Yee noted. Biogen is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Thursday and likely will be asked to discuss the implications of the updated Tecfidera warning. Biogen shares were up 9 cents at $273.91.

2018-05-03 00:00:00,2018,5.0,3,"Birth Control Probably Doesn't Change Who You're Attracted to, Study Finds","Women who are attracted to men tend to prefer the more traditionally masculine face on the left, but that preference has nothing to do with whether or not they take the birth control pill, a new study finds. Illustration:  Jones, et al. (Psychological Science)A commonly touted theory about how women’s attraction to men works might be all wrong, suggests a new paper published this week in Psychological Science. Prior, small experiments have  found that birth control pills and ovulation could change a woman’s sexual preferences. Now, a large new study has found that women’s preferences for men’s faces are reliably stable, regardless of whether they’re taking birth control pills or whether they’re ovulating.Some previous experiments have found that women taking hormonal contraceptives or experiencing their period were more likely to favor male facial features that are less associated with testosterone, like a rounder jaw or thinner eyebrows.  But these studies may have been flawed from the get-go, according to Ben Jones, a professor at the University of Glasgow’s Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology in the UK and lead author of the new work.“Researchers have highlighted some potential methodological problems with these studies, like testing only a relatively small number of women,” he told Gizmodo via email. “We set out to address these criticisms by carrying out the largest study of these issues to date.”Jones and his team recruited over 500 heterosexual-identifying women in the UK for their study. The women were shown 10 pairs of randomly selected male faces at the same time and told to pick which one they were more attracted to, as well as to rate how attractive the face was. The faces were slightly digitally altered to be more masculine- or feminine-looking; i.e., their cheekbones might have become more or less prominent. And each testing session was broken down into two parts, taken separately: The women rated the faces in terms of either liking them for a short-term fling or for a committed relationship.The women took these tests every week for five weeks, then were asked to come back in about six months and then about two years for more rounds of testing. At each session, they also submitted saliva samples, which were used to track hormone levels. The majority of women completed all five weeks of the first round, though only 200 returned for the second round six months later and only 18 returned for the third round two years later.“We found no evidence that women’s face preferences tracked changes in hormone levels or changes in women’s use of oral contraceptives,” Jones said. “Instead, we found that women generally preferred masculine men regardless of their own hormonal status.”The study has its own limitations. For one, all of the women who participated were white, and all of the digital faces were white as well. And of course, this was a highly controlled experiment involving digitally altered faces in a lab—how applicable such research might be to partner selection in the real world is up for debate.Though it’s just one study, Jones noted, it follows a paper published this past March that similarly found that for the women they studied, their menstrual cycle had no influence on how attracted they were to a man’s body overall.“I think the key thing for future studies on this topic is for researchers to be more ambitious in the scale and scope of the studies and to not be afraid to go back and test accepted results,” Jones said. “I also think it’s very encouraging that scientific journals are becoming more willing to publish these sorts of null results and not just be open to publishing results that confirm what we think we know.” Similar to other research, though, they found that women contemplating a fling picked more masculine faces on average, while women thinking about someone’s long-term prospects picked slightly less masculine faces on average. Ultimately, Jones and his team hope their findings can ease concerns that women taking birth control might have about the drug’s effects.“There are lots of reasons why women may want to or may not want to use hormonal contraceptives,” he said. “Our research suggests that their possible effects on attraction shouldn’t carry a lot of weight in those decisions.”[Psychological Science]",https://gizmodo.com/birth-control-probably-doesnt-change-who-youre-attracte-1825745979,Health,Gizmodo,health,705
2018-05-01 21:40:00,2018,5.0,1,Kylie Jenner Says She Was 'Insecure About My Lips',"For Kylie Jenner, an insecurity with her lips inspired a burgeoning cosmetics empire, specifically her best-selling Lip Kit products. The Keeping Up with the Kardashians reality star, 20, opened up about her makeup business in an interview with sister Kim Kardashian West for Evening Standard magazine, and revealed that lip makeup products helped give her confidence. “It came from an insecurity and I turned it into something. I was insecure about my lips, and lipstick is what helped me feel confident,” Jenner explained to fellow beauty mogul Kardashian West. “It’s the most authentic thing I’ve done in my career, and it really relates to me, and I feel like people can tell that I’m super passionate about it,” Jenner said about being an entrepreneur. “I feel like people could see that it’s authentic to me, and it was organic, and it just worked!” In May 2015, Jenner admitted that she enhanced her lips with temporary fillers after spending years overlining her mouth. And years later, in September 2017, the mother of one revealed she got fuller lips after a boy assumed she’d be a bad kisser because of her naturally thin lips. “I was 15 and I was insecure about my lips. I have really small lips. And it was like one of my first kisses and a guy was like, ‘I didn’t think you would be a good kisser because you have such small lips.’ But I took that really hard,” Jenner shared during an episode of her E! spin-off series, Life of Kylie. “Just when a guy you like says that, I don’t know, it just really affected me. I just didn’t feel desirable or pretty. I really wanted bigger lips. I would overline my lips with lip liner just to create the illusion of bigger lips. And then finally I was like this lip liner isn’t doing it. [I] ended up getting my lips done,” she added. While she has previously confessed to getting lip fillers, Jenner told Kardashian West that she is currently not pursuing any other procedures. “I feel like if it makes you feel better, and if that’s what you want to do, I’m not against it,” she said about plastic surgeries. “Right now I probably wouldn’t do anything, actually.” Older sister Kardashian West quipped, “You’re 20, so I hope not! We’ll talk in 20 years, and then maybe you’ll have a different answer.”",https://people.com/health/kylie-jenner-admits-she-was-insecure-about-her-lips-reveals-whether-shed-get-plastic-surgery/,health,People,health,400
2016-06-08 00:00:00,2016,6.0,8,Bump up your productivity at work by standing up," (CNN)By now, you have probably heard about the possible benefits of a standing desk: It could help you burn more calories during the day and reduce back and neck pain. But a new study suggests that standing desks could also boost productivity for some employees by a whopping 46%. Researchers studied the productivity of employees at a call center for a pharmaceutical company over a six-month period after the company purchased standing desks. The employees spent most of their days talking with clients on the phone about health issues, and their productivity was graded based on metrics such as whether they delivered pertinent information and whether callers decided to continue being clients. Within a month of getting standing desks, those employees were 23% more productive than their colleagues who continued to use traditional sitting desks. Over the next five months, the boost in productivity rose to 53%, possibly because they got used to working while standing. The average productivity increase over the entire half-year period was 46%. ""This is actually very encouraging. ... If an individual is trying to sell [standing desks] to an employer, they can look at this study,"" said Adam Pickens, assistant professor at the Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Public Health. Pickens is one of the authors of the study, which was published May 24 in the journal IIE Transactions on Occupational Ergonomics and Human Factors. If companies take up standing desks, they are probably going to do it for the health benefits, but they also want to make sure workers' productivity will not dip, Pickens said. A separate survey of the call center employees in the study found that, after several months of having standing desks, workers said they were spending about 70% of their day seated, whereas their peers who did not receive standing desks were spending 90% of their day sitting in a chair.  However, workers and their companies should not necessarily expect standing desks to deliver a nearly 50% spike in productivity. ""I think their claim of 46% increase in productivity is very misleading,"" said Alan Hedge, professor of ergonomics at Cornell University, who was not involved in the new study. The group of employees who did not receive a standing desk was less productive than the group who did, even at the beginning of the study. If you take that difference into account, there was probably a productivity boost of only about 14% or 15% associated with a standing desk, Hedge estimated. ""That difference would be completely in line with the 20-year history of other studies,"" he said. It is not clear why the employees at sitting desks were less productive at the outset than the standing desk group. The company assigned standing desks only to employees who had started in the previous few months, whereas employees who had been at the company at least a year were not given the option of a standing desk. So one explanation could be that the standing desk group was just more motivated because they had started working at the company more recently. Over the course of the study, from March to August, productivity dropped overall among both the standing and sitting groups, although there was less decline among the workers who had standing desks. Although it is unclear why, it is possible that productivity at this company generally takes a hit during the summer months, Pickens said. The new study is still an argument in favor of standing desks, Hedge said; it just might not be as strong an argument as the data would make you think.  The kind of tasks the employees in the study were doing could also have been especially conducive to standing at a desk. ""Talking on phone, watching video, reading, you can do while moving. You can't type and mouse very effectively,"" Hedge said. Studies have found that people are less effective at those tasks while standing.  The real key to reaping the productivity benefits of a standing desk work could be to figure out what tasks you do best sitting and standing and then to toggle between them. Making these transitions throughout the day, as well as moving around, is the healthiest arrangement for your muscles, bones and blood flow, Hedge said. There are plenty of low-tech ways to work more movement into your day without buying new equipment or furniture. Taking a microbreak in which you move around for a minute every 20 minutes or so has been shown to reduce discomfort. Similar to standing desks, microbreaks appear to increase productivity about 15%, Hedge said. However, you might want to keep this information to yourself if you are angling for your boss to buy you a standing desk.

2017-08-14 00:00:00,2017,8.0,14,How to use honesty app Sarahah for better self-esteem,"On the page of any Sarahah user, you'll find a simple prompt: ""Leave a constructive message :)"". The flashing cursor, trapped in a text box, invites you to pour whatever thoughts you have about that person, good or bad, into an anonymous feed. Your deepest, realest thoughts, ready to be delivered, guilt free. Sarahah, created in Saudi Arabia by Zain al-Abidin Tawfiq, has become a full-blown fad, taking over the feeds of Twitter and Facebook. The service, named for the Arabic word for ""honesty,"" quickly became a hit following its launch overseas in February, with BBC reporting more than 20 million users in a matter of weeks. Following its launch in June on the App Store, it rose to the top free app. Sarahah bills itself as a way to collect ""honest"" feedback — a chance for friends and co-workers to offer advice, comment on your strengths and weaknesses, or frankly point out problems. On Facebook and Twitter, you can spot a Sarahah user through screenshots of the teal speech bubbles that hold their anonymous messages. The hashtag for the service is a cascade of comments in a variety of languages. You can't reply to anyone on Sarahah, so some users choose to respond to their commenters this way. Searching through the Sarahah hashtag is a mix of people earnestly soliciting feedback, sharing their responses, or verbally rolling their eyes at the service. Much like posting a selfie, there's a certain performative nature to it. People have taken to posting their compliments online as a sort of celebration. How to stop the same song from autoplaying every time you plug your phone into a carThis fan-made book aims to be the most insane TMNT action figure encyclopedia of all timeNew trailers: Darren Aronofsky's horror movie, The Crown season two, and more For users who've decided to take the plunge, their interest is a combination feedback and general curiosity. I spoke with more than a dozen people who've used the app, whether to invite observations, comment, or both. User David Jenkins told me the experience for him has been eye-opening. ""I personally get a few wake-up calls, I suppose,"" he says. ""I figured I would get a few anonymous buttholes or whatever. But mostly I've been getting people coming out of the woodwork saying how much they miss me. Or how I wish I had kept in contact with them."" Twitter user Steven Coffin told me that, although he didn't have an account, he's sent comments to people he follows online. He says he prefers to send people compliments. ""I like making people happy,"" he says. ""I know a lot of people have stressful days or just horrible days and I want to make their day brighter and Sarahah gives me an easy way to do that."" He continues, ""Also, being anonymous stops them from thinking, 'Oh they are just saying this because they are my friend,' so I like that I can make people happy and that it doesn't matter who gives them the compliment, the only thing that matters is the compliment itself."" The users I spoke with have a surprisingly sunny view of how the system works, with many of them emphasizing their desire to brighten people's days with kind words. In testing out Sarahah myself, I was surprised by how overwhelmingly positive the comments I received were. (Less a humble brag as it is an honest declaration of shock.) One user told me that the anonymous nature of the platform impacts their desire to comment more, rather than the nature of comments. ""Being able to throw a joke out there without having to have my name attached makes me more willing to make them in the first place,"" they said. ""And I think the gratification of it actually being successful isn't diminished much by the anonymity, you still accomplish the goal of making people laugh."" Another user told me it makes it easier to approach people they'd otherwise not feel comfortable talking to. ""I mainly just try and send something encouraging to brighten their day cause I figure we could all use that,"" they told me via DM. ""I don't really get much of anything out of sending the comment, but it only takes a short amount of time and I hope it brightens up their day so why not?""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/14/how-to-use-honesty-app-sarahah-for-better-self-esteem.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,723
2019-02-01 00:00:00,2019,2.0,1,Self-taught teen pianist Darrius Simmons plays with four fingers ," (CNN)At a young age, Darrius Simmons fell in love with the piano. As he watched others play, he was amazed by the joy the piano gave them. He wanted to experience that, too, but knew for him it would be a challenge. ""I decided at age 10 that I wanted to learn how to play the piano, but I knew that it was going to take a little bit more work for me to learn,"" Simmons says. ""I knew most people had 10 fingers. I knew I had four, but I was pretty sure I could make it work."" The Warren, Ohio, teenager was born with a genetic condition called ectrodactyly. He has three fingers on his right hand and one finger on his left. He was also diagnosed with tibial hemimelia, a rare congenital lower-limb anomaly. At 18 months old, his legs were amputated below the knee.  None of these things stopped Simmons from following his passions. The right key With no formal training, Simmons taught himself by ear how to play the piano. He practiced and practiced, finding a way to reach the keys with four fingers while mastering the pedals with his prostheses. Simmons knew he would have to develop his own style of playing. ""I couldn't base it on the technique of somebody who has 10 fingers. It just wouldn't work'"" he says. ""That's why it was hard for me to take piano lessons. It's very complicated for somebody who has learned how to play with 10 fingers to adjust and teach me with only four.""  Simmons is also a skilled trombonist and is a member of several musical groups at Warren G. Harding High School, including the school's jazz and marching bands. Band director Reid Young says Simmons' learning process from early on was a little different.  ""He came to us playing piano by listening to other musicians and picking up on the melodies and the harmonies by ear,"" Young says. ""We worked hard with him from the beginning. He had great talent, but we wanted him to be able to read music and play -- and to do both equally well.""  The now 18-year-old not only learned how to play and read music but also began composing. ""His talent really helps raise the bar for the rest of the band,"" says Young. ""He serves as a leader in the group and an example of what  the other students can work towards, whether it is the solos that he performs or by playing first chair trombone in concert band."" His mother, Tamara Simmons, isn't surprised by Darrius' accomplishments. She knows how focused and determined he can be. ""You can't tell him he can't do anything -- he doesn't know the word 'can't.'  He won't accept that. He's just one heck of a boy."" An inspirational note ""I am a pianist,"" Simmons says with confidence. ""I compose some of my own original music. One of my most known compositions is called 'Dreams Are Forever.'""   He put himself out there on social media. Videos of him playing the piano struck a chord, especially with renowned South Korean pianist Yiruma. He invited Simmons to play onstage at Carnegie Hall in 2016.  For the most part, Simmons all but dismisses his birth defects. He navigates life like any other teenager with dreams. He plans to pursue a career in music after high school and hopes to motivate others. ""Being a nurse, I love caring for people. And my son is doing the same thing in his own way. I'm proud of that,"" his mom says. ""And it makes me happy that, through something he enjoys doing, he can touch people's lives in a positive way."" From mastering music to beating physical challenges, Darrius Simmons sets out to inspire the world, one listener at a time.  ""I like to be somebody's motivation,"" he says. ""If I play in front of a whole crowd and I see one person smile, that's a job well done.""

2020-01-17 00:00:00,2020,1.0,17,CDC to screen at three US airports for signs of new virus from China," (CNN)More than 100 staffers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are being deployed to three US airports to check passengers arriving from Wuhan, China, for fever and other symptoms of a mysterious new virus that's killed two and infected dozens in China, the CDC announced Friday.  It's a highly unusual step. The last time the CDC did routine passenger health screening was during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, according to Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's division of global migration and quarantine.  ""I've been here since 1996, and that's the only other time we've ever done this -- for Ebola,"" Cetron said. The screenings at New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport will start tonight, and screenings at San Francisco International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport will begin Saturday.  The CDC will look for symptoms such as coughing and difficulty breathing and check temperatures of each passenger with an infrared thermometer.  The CDC took these steps after travelers from Wuhan recently arrived in Thailand and Japan infected with the new virus. There have been two cases in Thailand and one in Japan.  ""Considering global travel patterns, additional cases in other countries are likely,"" the World Health Organization stated in a press release Thursday. Last year, more than 60,000 passengers flew into the United States from Wuhan, a city 700 miles south of Beijing. The vast majority flew into the three airports where the checks will take place, according to the CDC.  January is the peak travel season from China to the United States because of the Chinese Lunar New Year, Cetron said.  Cetron described the airport screenings as part of a set ""proactive preparedness precautions.""   ""We believe the current risk to this virus is low,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a press conference on Friday. ""For families sitting around the dinner table tonight, this is not something they need to worry about.""  At this point, it appears most people caught the virus directly from animals, and the infection does not spread very easily from person to person.  ""This is not a time for people to freak out and be overly concerned,"" Cetron said. ""This is a time for vigilance and awareness.""  He added that much more common illnesses, such as the flu, are ""much bigger threats"" to Americans than the new virus from China.  ""I'm fully aware that the unknown is more of a source of anxiety than that which is already defined,"" he said. ""But we should not freak out.""  What we know about the new virus So far, two people in China have died from this new virus, officially called the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Some 45 people in China have become infected. Some have developed pneumonia.  Coronaviruses, such as SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, are common in many species of animals, including camels and bats. Sometimes -- but rarely -- they evolve and infect humans as well.  Chinese health authorities have reported that most of the patients in Wuhan had visited a large seafood and animal market. However, some patients in the outbreak reportedly had not been to animal markets, which suggests that ""some limited person-to-person spread may be occurring,"" according to the CDC.  At least for now, that spread appears to be quite limited. Cetron said it's ""reassuring"" that Chinese authorities report that no health care workers who've cared for the patients have become infected, and that some 700 other contacts of patients have also not become ill.  ""This isn't anywhere near in the same category as measles or flu,"" Cetron said. Those two infections spread easily from person to person.  To learn more about this new virus, health authorities are taking a close look at SARS. In 2003, SARS spread to more than two dozen countries in Asia, Europe, North America and South America. Worldwide, more than 8,000 people became sick and 774 died. In the United States, there were 29 SARS cases and no deaths, according to the CDC.  SARS did spread person to person through close contact such as kissing, sharing utensils or talking to someone within 3 feet.  Cetron emphasized that this new virus may be different from its cousin and behave in unexpected ways.  ""We have to have humility and appreciate that it may be different. We can't just assume that what we know from previous viruses will always apply,"" he said.  New screening procedures Cetron said he expects that ""the vast majority"" of passengers arriving from Wuhan will be healthy. CDC will give them information in English and Mandarin about what symptoms to look for over the next two weeks.  After further investigation, travelers that are symptomatic will be sent to local hospitals that work with the CDC.  Cetron said the symptoms of the new virus are so common that he expects the screenings will catch many more people with the flu or other winter viruses than with the new coronavirus.  If it turns out someone does have the new virus, they'll be isolated in the hospital.  He added that while there are still many questions about this new virus -- its incubation period, for example, or how easily it spreads from person to person -- the progress on it in such a short time has been impressive, including a sequencing of the virus' genome.  ""It's quite remarkable to me that from a cluster of pneumonia detected just a little over a month ago in Wuhan, China, we have fully sequenced the virus and have some diagnostic capability to test for it,"" he said.

2017-05-23 00:00:00,2017,5.0,23,Symantec says 'highly likely' North Korea group behind ransomware attacks,"Cyber security firm Symantec said on Monday it was ""highly likely"" a hacking group affiliated with was behind the WannaCry cyber attack this month that infected more than 300,000 computers worldwide and disrupted hospitals, banks and schools across the globe. Symantec researchers said they had found multiple instances of code that had been used both in the North Korea-linked group's previous activity and in early versions of WannaCry. In addition, the same Internet connection was used to install an early version of WannaCry on two computers and to communicate with a tool that destroyed files at Sony Pictures Entertainment. The U.S. government and private companies have accused North Korea in the 2014 attack. North Korea has routinely denied any such role. On Monday, it called earlier reports that it might have been behind the WannaCry attack ""a dirty and despicable smear campaign."" Lazarus is the name many security companies have given to the hacking group behind the Sony attack and others. By custom, Symantec does not attribute cyber campaigns directly to governments, but its researchers did not dispute the common belief that Lazarus works for North Korea. In a blog post, Symantec listed numerous links between Lazarus and software the group had left behind after launching an earlier, less virulent, version of the malware in February. One was a variant of software used to wipe disks during the Sony Pictures attack, while another tool used the same internet addresses as two other pieces of malware linked to Lazarus. At the same time, flaws in the WannaCry code, its wide spread, and its demands for payment in the electronic bitcoin before files are decrypted suggest that the hackers were not working for North Korean government objectives in this case, said Vikram Thakur, Symantec's security response technical director. ""Our confidence is very high that this is the work of people associated with the Lazarus Group, because they had to have source code access, "" Thakur said in an interview. But he added: ""We don't think that this is an operation run by a nation-state."" With WannaCry, Thakur said, Lazarus Group members could have been moonlighting to make extra money, or they could have left government service, or they could have been contractors without direct obligations to serve only the government. The most effective version of WannaCry spread by using a flaw in 's Windows and a program that took advantage of it that had been used by the U.S. National Security Agency, officials said privately. That program was among a batch leaked or stolen and then dumped online by a group calling itself The Shadow Brokers, who some in U.S. intelligence believe to be affiliated with . Analysts have been weighing in with various theories on the identity of those behind WannaCry, and some early evidence had pointed to North Korea. The Shadow Brokers endorsed that theory, perhaps to take heat off their own government backers for the disaster. Cybersecurity company Kaspersky has said it had found several similarities between the WannaCry malware from the earlier attack and those used by Lazarus. But in an interview last week, its Asia research director, Vitaly Kamluk, said it was not conclusive evidence. ""It's unusual,"" he said. Beau Woods, deputy director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council, said that the Korean language used in some versions of the WannaCry ransom note was not that of a native speaker, making a Lazarus connection unlikely. But Thakur said that some hackers deliberately obfuscate their language to make tracing them harder. It is also possible that the writer in question was a contractor in another country, he said. Thakur said a less likely scenario is that Lazarus' main aim was to create chaos by distributing WannaCry. If the hackers' main objective was to earn money on the side, that would suggest an undisciplined hacking operation run by North Korea, one that could be exploited and weakened by the country's many foes. ""The intelligence community will probably take away from this that there is a possibility of splinters in the Lazarus Group, or members who are interested in filling their own pockets, and that could help, "" Thakur said. Lazarus has also been linked to attacks on banks using their SWIFT messaging network. Last year, hackers stole $81 million from Bangladesh's central bank. Symantec said malware used in that attack was linked to Lazarus.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/23/symantec-says-highly-likely-north-korea-group-behind-ransomware-attacks.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,728

2017-02-10 11:03:44,2017,2.0,10,Sticking With Windows 7,"Tech Tip Q. I am satisfied with Windows 7 and don’t wish to upgrade to Windows 10. Would a problem arise if I continue to use Windows 7, even after Microsoft stops sending updates for Windows 7? A. Microsoft stopped all official sales of the last available version of Windows 7 on Oct. 30 and began counting down to the end of its support for the operating system, originally released in 2009. The company has published the dates for milestones in the Windows 7 life cycle, and has moved from “mainstream support,” in which new features are developed and added as updates, to “extended support,” which mainly provides security patches. Extended support for Windows 7 is scheduled to end on Jan. 14, 2020. Certain third-party security software companies may provide their own updates for Windows 7 after Microsoft stops, so you might be able to keep using the system for a few more years with protection against malicious software. (Despite protection, though, security flaws in the older operating system may also be hard to fix.) As long as you are happy with Windows 7 and the programs you run on it continue to work, you can probably keep using the system as you do now. However, as software companies release newer versions of their applications and as web technologies continue to evolve, you may find that your Windows 7 computer runs slower and acts more erratically than it once did. Though you have a few years before Microsoft ends its support for Windows 7, it is a good idea to have a reliable backup plan now — if you do not already. Even if the software is outdated (but functional), hard drives and other components have been known to wear out and fail with age.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/technology/personaltech/sticking-with-windows-7.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,295
2019-06-17 00:00:00,2019,6.0,17,"Common nerve pain drug linked to suicidal behavior, overdose","(Reuters Health) - A class of medications used for nerve and muscle pain, including the popular drug Lyrica, increases users’ risks for suicidal behavior, unintentional overdoses, injuries and car accidents - and the risks are particularly high for teens and young adults, new research shows.  Lyrica (pregabalin) and the older drug gabapentin, collectively known as gabapentinoids, are approved for treating several types of pain and for preventing seizures in patients with epilepsy. Prescribing of these medications has increased sharply in recent years, while off-label use, meaning for a condition other than the approved indication, is extremely common, Dr. Seena Fazel of the University of Oxford in the UK and colleagues write in the BMJ.  There’s some data linking these drugs to an increased risk of suicidal behavior and death from overdose, the authors note, but the evidence is mixed and comes from small studies.  Fazel’s team looked at Swedish registry data on 191,973 people age 15 and older prescribed pregabalin or gabapentin in 2006-2013. During that period, 5.2% were treated for suicidal behavior or died from suicide, 8.9% had unintentional overdoses, 6.3% had serious car accidents resulting in emergency hospitalization or death or were arrested or convicted for a traffic offense, 36.7% had head or body injuries, and 4.1% were arrested for violent crimes.  Compared to when the same people weren’t taking a gabapentinoid drug, their risk while taking pregabalin or gabapentin was 26% higher for suicidal behavior or suicide, 24% higher for accidental overdose, 22% higher for head or body injuries, and 13% higher for car crashes and traffic offenses.  When the authors looked at the drugs separately, they found pregabalin was associated with a higher risk, but gabapentin was associated with a decreased risk or no change in risk.  In a statement emailed to Reuters Health, Lyrica maker Pfizer said: “When prescribed and administered appropriately as per the approved label, Lyrica (pregabalin) is an important and effective treatment option for many people. The clinical effectiveness of this medicine has been demonstrated in a large number of robust clinical trials among thousands of patients.”  “These medications clearly have a role if they’re used in people who have clear indications for their use,” Fazel agreed. Still, he told Reuters Health in a phone interview, “We need to be more careful about how these medications are prescribed and I think at the very least we should review guidelines about their use just to make sure these guidelines are up to date with the latest evidence.”  In an email interview, Dr. Derek K. Tracy of Queen Mary’s Hospital, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study, said: “This very large trial provides important information that pregabalin - but not gabapentin - increased the risk of a range of adverse outcomes, including suicide thinking and completed suicide, head injuries, and road traffic accidents. The risk was ‘dose-related’ which is to say the more one takes, the more likely such outcomes were, and young people aged 15 to 24 seem particularly susceptible.”  While it’s not clear why prescribing of gabapentinoids has grown so rapidly, Tracy said, “anecdotally it appears that many doctors regarded them as relatively effective and with a low side effect profile. As we accumulated more information over time, it has become clear that this is not the case, and most recently there has been a countering drive to try reduce their usage as their harm profile came more to the fore.”  He added: “It is also becoming clearer with time that some people are becoming dependent (“addicted”) to gabapentinoids, though we still lack good information on exactly how common that is, or which groups of people might be more vulnerable to this.”  The Wellcome Trust helped fund the study.

2019-12-05 00:00:00,2019,12.0,5,Uber takes to streets of Ivory Coast in African expansion,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Uber launched in Ivory Coast’s commercial capital Abidjan on Thursday, part of its expansion into African markets with low levels of car ownership and limited mass transport. The ride-hailing firm is facing competition from Estonia-based Bolt, which takes a smaller cut from drivers and plans to double its service in South Africa. Although Uber, which is also facing regulatory clampdowns elsewhere, operates in 16 cities in sub-Saharan Africa, mostly in South Africa and east Africa, its presence has so far been limited in west Africa, aside from Nigeria and Ghana. Abidjan, a commercial hub of nearly 5 million people, was a “perfect fit”, Uber said in a statement, adding that more than 50,000 people had tried to use its app there in the past year. “This means that for the thousands of taxi operators in Abidjan, there will be new clients for every single driver, in addition to the number they already have now,” Alon Lits, Uber’s general manager for sub-Saharan Africa, said. Uber has experimented with new services in Africa, including ferries across the lagoon in Nigeria’s traffic-clogged megacity of Lagos, in a bid to woo the continent’s fast-growing population. An Uber executive told Reuters in June that it was also in talks with regulators in Senegal about launching services in the capital Dakar.

So, in response, the company is rolling out a pop-up today that’ll provide users with drug addiction resources if they search certain hashtags, like “opioid.” The pop-up reads: “If you or someone you know is struggling with opioid or substance misuse, find ways to get free and confidential treatment referrals, as well as information about substance abuse, prevention, and recovery.” The user can then opt to get support resources that Instagram developed with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, and the Partnership for Drug Free Kids. There will also be advice for family and friends of people with substance abuse problems. Instagram says that while many people use these drug-related hashtags to find support communities, others misuse them to sell drugs. In some cases, Instagram has blocked or limited these hashtags, but this prevents helpful support communities from forming, the company says. There are already similar resources built in to Facebook. If users search for certain drug-related topics, like “buy Xanax,” they’ll get a substance support box similar to Instagram’s. The company also blocks certain searches to prevent drug dealers from reaching people. This new Instagram pop-up attempts to solve some of the platform’s drug issues, even if it doesn’t address the actual substance sales. It does at least give users a place to go if they’re searching for help.

Cuban shared personal anecdotes about his experiences with Trump at a South by Southwest Festival audience in Austin, Texas on Sunday, saying he stopped supporting Trump after he ""got to know him."" ""The economic policies of his that are pretty much traditionally conservative I like.... But in terms of him personally, he's the Zoolander president,"" Cuban said to the audience, referring to a hit film comedy starring Ben Stiller. The audience roared with laughter. Cuban, who called himself a libertarian, spoke on a panel alongside car insurance marketplace The Zebra's Adam Lyons. Lyons scored Cuban as an investor in his company after cold emailing him a one paragraph pitch. Cuban said there would be no appointment from Trump he would ever consider. ""His idea of efficiency is I would send him emails, his assistant would print it, he would write on it, and he would scan it,"" Cuban said. ""He doesn't know how to use email."" The entrepreneur also noted Trump doesn't know how to use Google. ""Just think how efficient he could be if he learned how to use a search engine,"" Cuban said. Overall, however, Cuban wants Trump's presidency to be successful. ""First of all he's our president,"" he said.

2017-12-06 15:14:00,2017,12.0,6,This Is What Facebook Oversharing Does to Your Stress Levels,"Social media makes it easy to share everything from diarrhea to divorce, but how much is healthy? Nine years ago, when I was newly separated and eager for social support, I clicked the post button, meaning to message an old friend about the agony of my failed marriage. Unfortunately, I was also a novice Facebook user. So when my friend called, I thought she was simply offering support, but then she explained that private messages were different from public wall posts. And when I realized I had posted a mass personal communication announcing details of my divorce, my stress levels skyrocketed. It’s healthy to reach for camaraderie during difficult times, and social media makes it easy to recruit support. Pew research notes Facebook users report significantly higher levels of social support, emotional support, and companionship than nonusers. In fact, a 2011 report published by Pew Research states, “Someone who uses Facebook multiple times per day gets about half the boost in total support that someone receives from being married or living with a partner.” (Plus, Facebook doesn’t leave dirty socks lying around.) Social media can be an excellent support resource, but it can be a significant source of stress as well. The problem is during hardship, what we choose to share on social media—and how others respond to it—can seriously impact our stress levels. While my post was a mistake, people sometimes seem to have verbal diarrhea on social media.

The company, one of a handful of startups building fully autonomous systems for cars, also said it had added to its board Andrew Ng, a prominent figure in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. Ng formerly led AI projects at Baidu and Alphabet’s Google. Ng is the husband of Drive.ai’s co-founder and president Carol Reiley, a roboticist. The latest round of funding - led by New Enterprise Associates, Inc, GGV Capital and existing investor China-based Northern Light Venture Capital - came as investor interest in autonomous vehicles continued to intensify. Drive.ai is aiming to build an after-market software kit powered by artificial intelligence to turn traditional vehicles operated by businesses into self-driving models. The company said existing business fleets would deploy its kits in pilot tests by year-end. Drive.ai plans to distinguish itself through the team’s expertise in robotics and deep learning, a subset of AI in which massive amounts of data are fed into systems until they can “think” for themselves. Drive.ai, which received $12 million in an initial funding round last year, also named to its board the head of Asia for New Enterprise Associates, Carmen Chang.

2017-05-01 21:37:00,2017,5.0,1,Barrett Brown Went to Prison Again for Talking to Me," I never would've interviewed Barrett Brown if I'd known it would lead to him being re-arrested.  Brown, of course, is something of a legend in the hacker world as a journalist who broke several of the first high-profile stories about Anonymous and later aligned himself closely with the shadowy, loose-knit hacktivist collective.   Brown was arrested in September 2012 for linking to documents hacked from the security firms HBGary Federal and Stratfor. Legally speaking, the case was pretty convoluted, with many of the initial charges getting dropped and additional ones being added later; Brown later pleaded guilty to three charges. In 2015, he was sentenced to five years in prison including time served. Brown, 35 was released to a halfway house last November.   Brown recently agreed to let me follow him around for two days with cameras to document his post-prison life in Dallas. I wanted to talk to him about America's creeping surveillance state. Clips from our interview are embedded throughout this post.  Last week, the Texas Bureau of Prisons (BOP) arrested Brown after calling him in for a routine drug test. Brown said the BOP took him into custody for doing interviews with various media outlets. Our on-camera interview took place right before he was re-arrested.   ""Last week I was re-arrested by the U.S. Marshals Service on the orders of the Bureau of Prisons, which still technically holds sway over my life until May 25th when my sentence officially ends,"" Brown said in a statement via  D magazine, which Brown has been writing for. ""Contrary to BOP policy, and indeed federal law, I was not provided a written infraction report, much less given the disciplinary hearing that normally precedes punishment.""   Brown says he had been given no written specifics about who he is allowed to talk to. The BOP did not respond to Motherboard's request for comment seeking further clarification. Brown was released again Monday afternoon after spending the weekend at the FCI Seagoville prison in Texas.  This is actually the second time Brown's gotten in trouble for speaking with a VICE reporter (the first time was for a Q&A with Patrick McGuire).   After we spoke last week in various locations all over Dallas, I personally dropped Brown off at his halfway house for a drug test that he told me he had passed. Before that, I witnessed him arguing on the phone with a local politician about a column he's writing and ask the BOP to give him clarity about whether or not he was allowed to speak to the media. It never returned his calls while we were together. A statement published by Brown's mother suggests that Brown was arrested very soon after speaking to me.   ""It's not policy, it's not like there's someone at the national BOP saying 'Oh, Barrett Brown is going to do an interview,'"" Brown told me soon before he was arrested. ""It's more like there's individual people in this institution who have a vague idea of what's wanted of them by their superiors. And so you have policy effectively being made on the ground in ways that don't make a lot of sense.""  Ironically, we were interviewing Brown for a future episode of  Cyberwar about the growing domestic surveillance state and the cyberpower of law enforcement agencies. Brown is highly suspicious of the various companies—namely Peter Thiel's Palantir—hawking wares that enable what he calls the ""cyber-industrial complex."" Our discussions last week, like the hilarious columns Brown wrote for The Intercept while incarcerated, were fascinating and insightful. Brown's is an important voice working to expose problems within the cybersecurity industry—let's hope he's not silenced again for speaking out.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ypya9x/barrett-brown-went-to-jail-again-for-talking-to-me,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,605

2017-06-08 19:32:00,2017,6.0,8,F.D.A. Asks Drug Maker to Stop Selling a Dangerous Opioid,"On Thursday, for the first time in its history, the Food and Drug Administration asked a drug company to take an opioid medication off the market because of concerns about drug abuse. The drug, Opana ER — a form of the painkiller oxymorphone hydrochloride — has been heavily abused and linked to outbreaks of H.I.V., hepatitis C and a serious blood disorder among people who crush the pills into powder and inject it. The move by the F.D.A. may signal a more aggressive approach against prescription opioids that are found to be widely abused. “We are facing an opioid epidemic — a public health crisis, and we must take all necessary steps to reduce the scope of opioid misuse and abuse,” Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the F.D.A. commissioner, said in a statement released by the agency. He added that the F.D.A. would continue to “take regulatory steps” against products fueling the epidemic. The drug’s maker, Endo Pharmaceuticals, responded with a statement saying that it was reviewing the request and “evaluating the full range of potential options as we determine the appropriate path forward.” Endo has global headquarters in Dublin and United States headquarters in Malvern, Pa. If Endo does not take the drug off the market, the F.D.A. “intends to take steps to formally require its removal by withdrawing approval,” the agency said in its news release. Opana ER is an extended-release painkiller that was first approved in 2006. Drug users began to crush it so they could snort it or inject it to get high. In 2012, Endo replaced the original version with a new formulation that was meant to thwart abuse by making the pills resistant to crushing and dissolving in liquid for injection. Users found ways to inject the drug anyway, and the problems worsened after the new formulation was introduced, an F.D.A. spokeswoman said. She said generic forms of the original version were still available, and the F.D.A. is looking at abuse patterns of those drugs to determine whether they, too, should be taken off the market. Dr. Gottlieb said in an interview that trying to end the opioid epidemic “will continue to be one of my highest priorities, if not my highest priority.” An article on June 8 about the Food and Drug Administration’s request that the painkiller Opana be taken off the market referred incorrectly to the action by the F.D.A. This was the first time the agency had requested an opioid medication be taken off the market because of concerns about drug abuse; it was not the first request to take an opioid medication off the market.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/health/fda-opioid-opana-er.html,health,The New York Times,health,433

""At some point your morals and ethics conflict with what the right business logic is."" Palihapitiya, who severed in various management roles at Facebook from 2007 to 2011, came out about two years ago against the direction his former company was taking, saying social media is addictive and bad for society. (Palihapitiya is also a minority stakeholder and board member of the NBA's Golden State Warriors.) Shortly after leaving Facebook, Palihapitiya started Social Capital, raising and investing venture funds in then-startups including Slack and Box. In September 2018, after a tumultuous few months, he closed the firm to outside money. On Monday, in a second act, Palihapitiya saw the merger of his special purpose acquisition company and billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic come to fruition, with the space tourism stock soaring in its New York Stock Exchange debut. Appearing on ""Squawk on the Street"" with Branson to talk about space, Palihapitiya was also asked about Facebook and whether the social network has been moving down a better road lately. Companies have a choice to take a stand or ""just take a hear-no-evil-see-no-evil approach and we're going to maximize business value,"" said Palihapitiya.

2019-02-04 00:00:00,2019,2.0,4,Report shows significant increase in IUDs after Trump election,"The number of privately insured women seeking long-acting reversible contraceptives significantly increased in the 30 days following President Donald Trump's election in 2016, according to a study published Monday. Harvard University researchers said a higher-than-expected number of American women ages 18 to 45 sought intrauterine devices and implants immediately after the election. The researchers, whose study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, looked at women enrolled in commercial insurance during the 30 business days before and after Nov. 8 in 2015 and 2016 and used billing codes to calculate the number of such procedures. The researchers said that if they projected their findings to the 33 million insured women in the age group, the number would rise from an expected 4,716 insertions per day to 5,416, or 700 more per day. ""Our findings could reflect a response to fears of losing contraceptive coverage because of President Trump's opposition to the ACA or an association of the 2016 election with reproductive intentions or LARC awareness,"" study lead author Dr. Lydia Pace said, referring to long-acting reversible contraceptives. Long-term birth control is attractive for a few reasons. IUDs and implants can remain in place for years, meaning some can last longer than Trump's presidency. They're also more effective: IUDs are 99 percent effective compared with 91 percent for the pill, according to Planned Parenthood. Although more costly out of pocket — IUDs range from $500 to $1,000 and the implant Nexplanon can cost $1,300 — some women have 100 percent of costs covered by insurance. Pace noted that the study has limitations because the researchers lacked information on race and ethnicity and studied only women with commercial insurance. Lower out-of-pocket costs for birth control can be attributed to the Affordable Care Act, which mandates that insurers cover birth control. But one of Trump's campaign promises was to repeal and replace Obamacare, and that led many women to fear they'll have to pay for birth control in its entirety. Pace said the findings suggest that women value their birth control coverage, and fear of losing that coverage may prompt a change in contraceptive methods. ""The ACA's contraceptive coverage mandate is an important strategy to reduce unintended pregnancies,"" according to the study. ""The Trump Administration has weakened this mandate."" Doctors and women's health organizations agree. ""At Planned Parenthood, there was a nearly tenfold increase in appointments for IUDs in the first week after the election,"" a spokeswoman for the women's health nonprofit said in an email. ""We also saw an unprecedented surge in questions about access to health care and birth control, both online and in our health centers. People were concerned that they might lose their coverage under a new Administration."" Mara Gandal-Powers, senior counsel of reproductive rights and health at the National Women's Law Center, which runs a birth control hotline, said her organization also noticed an uptick in questions about birth control. Just after the election and the January 2017 inauguration, the hotline noticed a ""significant"" increase in questions about long-term contraceptive methods. Some of the increase is because more health providers are recommending the method. But Gandal-Powers said to see that kind of increase in just 30 days strongly suggests women were seeking out IUDs and implants as quickly as possible.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/04/report-shows-significant-increase-in-iuds-after-trump-election.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,545
2017-02-23 16:04:00,2017,2.0,23,"This Single Vaccine Could Protect Against Zika, Dengue, and Malaria"," The mosquito is regularly crowned the most deadly animal on Earth, and with good reason. Infectious diseases spread by these insects—including malaria, dengue, and Zika—mean mosquitoes are responsible for 725,000 human deaths every year. Rather than looking for a vaccine for each of these different diseases, what if we made a vaccine against mosquitoes themselves? That's exactly what scientists have done, and they're about to test it on humans for the first time. The vaccine, called AGS-v, was developed by researchers in London and is about to be tested through a small trial conducted by the National Institutes of Health. Here's how it works: researchers have learned that mosquitoes' saliva is spiked with a cocktail of proteins that makes it easier for them to feed. When a mosquito bites you, these proteins interact with your body and cause a number of changes that help the skitter to suck up some blood: your blood vessels dilate, your blood thins a little bit, and your body's immune response is disabled very slightly. But the real trouble lies in the pathogenic organisms that a mosquito might carry, such as the Zika virus or the malaria parasite. These organisms take advantage of the mosquitoes' effects on your body after the bite to infect you without immediate detection from your immune system. ""You have to try not to anthropomorphize,"" said Dr. Matthew Memoli, the director of the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases clinical studies unit at the NIH. ""It's not like the mosquito is purposely making saliva that does something to help the organism. It's just a natural relationship that this is happening—it's the way everything evolved."" Watch Motherboard's visit to an underground mosquito lab: The AGS-v vaccine is designed to stimulate an immune response in humans by injecting some of these mosquito-spit proteins, but in a higher level than you would get from a mosquito bite. The idea is that, if your body learns to recognize these proteins as a threat through the vaccine, the next time a mosquito bites you, your body can counteract their effects: ideally, there will be no dilated blood vessels, no blood thinning, and most importantly, no hit to the immune system. ""Because you've been sensitized, you won't respond in the same way and you'll have enough of an [immune] response that you'll stay protected from whatever the organism is that's trying to infect you,"" Memoli told me. The vaccine has been tested on rabbits and mice, with some promising results, but this will be the first time it's tested in humans. The NIH will enlist 60 adults and give them either two doses of the vaccine or two doses of a placebo. About a month after the second dose, the participants will have to come in and offer up their arm to (disease-free) mosquitoes, to see what kind of response their bites provoke. Memoli told me there's a chance the vaccine won't work entirely on its own, but it could be a kind of booster for other disease-specific vaccines. So a malaria vaccine may target the parasite, while this vaccine targets the mosquito, and together they could provide broader protection against infection. ""Mosquitoes that fed on mice that received this vaccine also didn't survive as long as mosquitoes that fed on animals that did not receive the vaccine,"" Memoli said. ""There's potential that this could not only help prevent a person from becoming infected but also prevent mosquitoes from taking good blood meals and surviving to reproduce, which would ultimately be good for reducing spread of the disease."" If even one of these angles for the vaccine turns out to be effective, it could be a real boon to the fight against mosquito-spread infection diseases and may finally knock the world's most deadly animal down a few pegs.

2019-10-25 00:00:00,2019,10.0,25,MrBeast changed YouTube and launched an entire genre of expensive stunt content,"MrBeast has accomplished a feat that no other individual creator has achieved in YouTube history: surpassing 10 million views on every single video he’s posted for more than a year straight. Now people are trying to imitate his rise to the top. In early 2017, MrBeast, real name Jimmy Donaldson, began to skyrocket in popularity, his videos growing bigger and more ambitious alongside the new viewership. Donaldson started publishing 12-hour videos of himself performing lengthy but mundane tasks (like reading every word in the dictionary), and he has progressed into much showier stunt performances. He’s become known for large-scale, exhausting, and expensive challenge videos, with premises that include “Paying People $10,000 To Eat Ghost Pepper,” “I Bought Everything In A Store,” and “Last To Remove Hand, Wins House.” They’ve helped his channel grown from 100,000 subscribers to 25 million subscribers in less than two years. YouTube has shifted under Donaldson’s influence, with grandeur challenges and sponsor-fueled money giveaways becoming an overnight sensation. Other YouTubers, like Azzyland and MindofRez, have also run with Donaldson’s ideas, adding their own takes to some of his more popular videos or sometimes going one step further to parody them. In one instance, the channel Tiana published a video reenacting the exact same challenge Donaldson did five months earlier. The video, “Last One to Leave the Slime Pool,” netted Tiana more than 2 million views. Another YouTuber, Carter Sharer, copied Donaldson’s “Last One to Leave Roof” challenge and pulled in more than 12 million views in the process. Challenges are only one part of the formats Donaldson has popularized. Other videos include buying as much of one product as possible and using it in an absurd way. For example, one of Donaldson’s most popular videos is “I Put Millions of Pennies in my Friend’s Backyard.” This style of video is something longtime YouTuber and Smosh co-founder Anthony Padilla refers to as “junklord YouTube.” Effectively, a creator will spend an exuberant amount of money on an absurd amount of product — 1 million red Lego blocks or 10,000 pounds of dry ice — that’s meant to be used for one video, and the sheer extravagance and oddity pull in curious viewers. “It doesn’t matter what the item is, or the topic of the video anymore, really,” Rob Wilson, a YouTube creator and analyst at VidIQ, told The Verge. “They’re just fascinated in what [Donaldson] does. He has the ideas of a 12-year-old and he turns them into a reality in a way YouTubers haven’t done before.” No one has perfected the model like Donaldson, but that hasn’t stopped others from trying. One creator, in particular — Morgan “Morgz” Hudson — has attracted ire from the creator community because of his attempts to copy Donaldson’s stunts. Hudson has used extremely similar thumbnails while re-creating some of Donaldson’s most viral videos, including spending a night in prison as part of a challenge. Members of popular YouTube collectives like Faze Clan have shouted out Donaldson in their own versions of his videos, including stunts like, “Paying for Everything You Can Carry.” “There’s something in the human brain that is just, ‘Oh my god, there are so many of these things, I have to see it,’” Padilla said in a video examining the rise of MrBeast copycats. “There’s no doubt that watching someone waste a whole bunch of money, doing something ridiculous with a whole bunch of things, is fascinating.” People have an inherent fascination with watching the extreme, Wilson said. While most creators can’t match Donaldson’s spending habits — most of his money comes from brand deals — nor can they pull in the same viewership numbers, there’s enough of an incentive to try, according to Dallas Korol. Korol is a longtime YouTuber who has known Donaldson since 2012 when they played Xbox Live together. While Korol believes YouTubers who try to perform the same stunts as Donaldson do find some joy from producing that specific type of content, he also believes the potential to make money, in the long run, plays a major factor. “If I were to assume what the minds of most YouTubers think, it would be mainly just to get views because I don’t think anyone really likes spending $10,000 on a video,” Korol told The Verge. “But you have to have some passion and want to actually do it because it would reflect off your video if you’re not having a fun time. It’s still definitely 90 percent wanting to get views.” This happens with every burst in popular content, Korol said. Donaldson’s over-the-top-stunt-content-meets-philanthropy is just the latest trend. When Minecraft became a big focus point on YouTube, non-gaming creators found ways to rack in those views. Others have dropped their channel’s mainstay content to focus on becoming drama vloggers or commentators. Borrowing formats isn’t entirely frowned upon, but the YouTube community appreciates it when creators bring enthusiasm and an original approach to the mix so it doesn’t just feel like they’re doing it for the views. “Ultimately, I think anybody can do it because MrBeast has proved that this is a successful model,” Wilson told The Verge. “It’s probably going to be harder to replicate because it’s not a unique idea anymore. No one is doing it bigger or better than him.” Conversation has shifted within the YouTube community away from “who will become the next MrBeast?” into “what comes after MrBeast?” There’s no doubt that YouTube viewers have an appetite for the gargantuan style of videos he makes, but looming concern about burnout, the financial cost of constantly trying to best his most popular videos, and incoming competition all point toward an inevitable change for Donaldson. Many top YouTube creators have felt that same pressure to adapt. Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg went from being a gaming creator to reviewing memes and back to a gaming channel over the last decade. Wilson points out that YouTube, like fashion, is cyclical. “If and when the cycle ends, and if it does become a stale topic, MrBeast is probably intelligent enough to transition,” Wilson said. “He’s survived and thrived on YouTube for years. That’s no coincidence.”",https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20924718/mrbeast-youtube-stunts-challenges-money-philanthropy-creators-morgz,Tech,The Verge,technology,1019
2016-12-22 05:00:23,2016,12.0,22,Your Liver Doesn’t Know It’s the Holidays,"Trilobites Over the holidays, many of us will drink, stay up past bedtime, eat an extra slice of pie and sleep in. Fun as they are, these activities can tamper with our circadian rhythms, the feedback loops that sync our body’s functions to our external environment. The liver, which helps regulate your body’s metabolism, gets thrown off by unhealthy patterns of sleep or by changes in diet or alcohol consumption. If you’re experiencing indigestion or your energy levels are low after too many holiday parties, your liver could be out of sync. In recent years, more and more research in the field of chronobiology, the science of biological rhythms, suggests the importance of maintaining a consistent schedule for the sake of your liver, which has a clock of its own. Circadian rhythms are important for helping the liver anticipate the body’s demands throughout the day, like stockpiling energy after meals and releasing it when we sleep, said Felix Naef, a professor of quantitative biology at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. Recent studies have examined how alcohol affects circadian rhythms. This year, researchers reported that night shift workers given two to four glasses of wine each day for a week had altered circadian rhythms and “leakier” intestinal linings than day workers, which could put them at risk of alcoholic liver disease. Dr. Garth R. Swanson, a gastroenterologist at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago and an author of the study, says he believes this risk applies to any drinkers who frequently shift their circadian rhythms by more than two hours. “People don’t have to be working night shifts for months or years,” he said. “You could potentially put yourself at risk just by doing a series of bad behaviors for a relatively short amount of time.” Other studies in mice have implications for understanding the liver’s cycles. Last month, Dr. Naef and a team of researchers reported finding more than 500 proteins in mice liver cells that shift in abundance over the course of the day. These proteins ultimately help the liver filter blood and process fats and sugars. When they are thrown off their tight schedules, the liver might lag in important processes like detoxification and digestion. Our daily liver cycles are molded by an interplay between sleep, food and alcohol. Sleep affects the master clock in our brain. Like most other bodily organs, the liver is partly governed by this central rhythm. But the liver also has its own internal clock, which can be affected by food and alcohol. In studies with mice, John Y. L. Chiang, a professor of biochemistry at Northeast Ohio Medical University, has found that even short-term changes in either sleep or diet can affect the liver’s ability to contribute to fat digestion. Chronic disturbances, he said, may lead to fat accumulation in the liver, which can cause “many different problems: fatty liver disease, diabetes, obesity, heart disease and even cancer.” Alcohol can also knock a mouse’s liver rhythms out of whack, said Shannon M. Bailey, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Her team recently found that feeding mice moderate levels of alcohol for a month significantly disrupted the functioning of their liver clocks. To keep your liver’s clock consistent this holiday season, avoid extreme behaviors, said Lei Yin, an assistant professor of physiology at the University of Michigan. That means maintaining your central circadian rhythm with a regular sleep schedule. You can stay up a little later, but try to avoid doing so more than two hours past your normal bedtime. A helpful tip is to go on a walk in the mornings. “Light is the most powerful way to reset our internal clock,” Dr. Yin said. It also means staying cognizant of how food and alcohol affect your liver’s timers. Try to stick to normal mealtimes. And it’s fine to drink a little, but avoid binge drinking, which is defined as more than four or five drinks in two hours. In the short term, sticking to these guidelines might ease your transition back to reality, once the holidays are over. In the long term, maintaining a regular schedule and drinking less can safeguard your metabolism and prevent disease.

2020-02-27 00:00:00,2020,2.0,27,BOJ's Amamiya calls for more scrutiny in issuing digital currency,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Central banks must get a better understanding of the benefits and risks of issuing their own digital currencies, and look at ways to mitigate any associated perils, Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Masayoshi Amamiya said on Thursday. By issuing their own digital currencies, central banks can act as a bridge for private sector money flows and streamline settlement, Amamiya said. All the same, such a practice could also stifle private-sector financial innovation and draw money away from deposits at commercial banks if they succeed in issuing low-cost digital currencies, he said. “When countries consider issuing central bank digital currencies, they must conduct a comprehensive study on how it affects their settlement and financial systems,” Amamiya said in a speech in Tokyo on Japan’s settlement system. Some emerging economies are looking seriously at issuing central bank digital currencies (CBDC) because of the need to counter money laundering or to deal with a lack of resilient financial infrastructure. Japan and many other advanced economies do not face such problems that require them to immediately issue CBDCs, he said. “Unlike emerging economies, we cannot and should not jump immediately” towards issuing CBDCs, Amamiya said. The current stance among advanced economies is to deal with money laundering through regulations and oversight - rather than issuing CBDCs, he said. Still, the BOJ will set up a team within the bank looking into CBDCs and work closely with its overseas counterparts on the topic, Amamiya said. Facebook’s (FB.O) push to launch its Libra cryptocurrency has prodded central banks to fast-track reviews of issuing digital currencies. The central banks of Britain, the euro zone, Japan, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland last month announced a plan to share experiences to look at the case for issuing digital currencies, amid a growing debate over the future of money.

2016-12-01 00:00:00,2016,12.0,1,Magic Mushrooms Are Weirdly Effective at Making Cancer Less Miserable,"The active ingredient in magic mushrooms, psilocybin, is remarkably effective at reducing feelings of anxiety, depression, and other forms of mental anguish in cancer patients, according to a pair of new studies. “Our results represent the strongest evidence to date of a clinical benefit from psilocybin therapy.”New research published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology shows that a single dose of mind-altering psilocybin, in conjunction with psychotherapy, reduces depression, anxiety, and other emotional distress in patients with advanced cancer, while increasing feelings of well-being. Importantly, these effects lasted for months. It’s a potent example of how psychedelics could be used to treat various illnesses, and how the medical community’s squeamishness about these drugs—not to mention the various government agencies which have banned them—is in need of a serious re-think. Small trials have shown psilocybin’s promise in treating alcoholism, opiate addiction, and depression. This latest research offers some of the most compelling evidence yet for the use of psychedelics to treat complex and profound emotional disorders, particularly in patients with life-threatening illnesses. Could a notorious party drug be the next psychiatric breakthrough?MDMA is a drug that’s typically associated with youth culture and dance parties — but it’s…Read more ReadResearchers from NYU Langone showed that a one-time treatment with psilocybin quickly brought relief from emotional distress that lasted for more than six months in 80 percent of the 29 study subjects monitored. Participants were evaluated according to standard measures of depression and anxiety, such as  blood pressure, heart rate, clinician-based tests, and self-reported questionnaires.A similar study from Johns Hopkins reached the same conclusion. Because psilocybin is a banned substance, the US researchers had to acquire special federal waivers to conduct the trials.“Our results represent the strongest evidence to date of a clinical benefit from psilocybin therapy, with the potential to transform care for patients with cancer-related psychological distress,” noted Stephen Ross, who led the NYU Langone study, in a statement. “If larger clinical trials prove successful, then we could ultimately have available a safe, effective, and inexpensive medication—dispensed under strict control—to alleviate the distress that increases suicide rates among cancer patients.”During the treatments, half of the patients were given a 0.3 milligrams per kilo dose of psilocybin, and half were given one of two placebos, either a super low dose of psilocybin or the vitamin niacin (which produces a “rush” that mimics a hallucinogenic drug experience). The researchers chose these particular “placebos” because if they hadn’t, it would have been glaringly obvious to the participants that they were being duped with a bona fide placebo, such as a sugar pill (as anyone who has ever done shrooms before would know, the effects aren’t subtle).During each session, participants laid on a couch, wore a blindfold, and listened to music.  The researchers encouraged the patients to focus their attention on their inner experiences. Follow-up analysis showed that the single-dose treatment of psilocybin produced almost immediate results. In addition to quelling feelings of despair, anguish, and depression, the drug boosted measures of the quality and meaning of life, the acceptance of death, and optimism. Several patients reported feelings of spirituality, unusual peacefulness, and increased altruism. Side effects were few and minor, including nausea, headache, and some residual anxiety (many of these patients are dying of cancer, so shrooms shouldn’t be expected to alleviate all emotional  stress). Roland Griffiths, who led the Hopkins trial, said the drug offers patients a sense of unity, and a feeling that everything is connected at some level. “After this kind of experience, people feel that they’ve learned something that’s of deep meaning and value to them,” explained Griffiths in New Scientist. “They attribute changes in how they approach life, interact with people and to their value systems to that experience.”The researchers caution that patients shouldn’t medicate themselves with magic mushrooms without supervision by a physician and a trained counselor. “Psilocybin therapy may not work for everyone, and some groups, such as people with schizophrenia, as well as adolescents, should not be treated with it,” noted Anthony Bossis, a psychiatrist at NYU Langone and co-author of the new study.

2016-09-19 13:00:00,2016,9.0,19,Supermaterials Offer New Means of Searching for Superlight Dark Matter,"No one said detecting dark matter would be easy. We didn't even know about the stuff until a couple of decades ago, after all, despite the fact that it represents some 85 percent of all of the mass in the universe and is what's responsible for giving structure to the cosmos. We see its effects across the universe, but we have yet to see it. We're not even sure what exactly we're looking for—there are many theories as to the exact properties of a dark matter particle. Some aren't even all that dark. The leading candidate for dark matter is a particle known as a WIMP, or weakly-interacting massive particle. These are really heavy, classically ""dark"" particles. They interact with other matter via only the gravitational force, crucially evading electromagnetic interactions, which are what most of the interactions we see out in the world are based on: from a baseball whapping into a catcher's mitt to the nanoscale electrical circuits enabling the machine you are now staring at.  WIMP detection is premised on WIMPs having sufficient mass to smack into an atomic nuclei with enough force to create a bit of light or heat, which can then be registered by the detector. A problem then arises when we start trying to imagine dark matter particles that maybe aren't so heavy and, as such, may result in interactions below the sensitivity of current detectors. This is where the work of Kathryn Zurek and colleagues at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory comes in—bagging superlight dark matter may require supermaterials.  Zurek and co.'s work is described in two papers published last week in the Physical Review Letters. One looks at the possibility of using helium superfluids to detect dark matter while the other considers superconducting metals. Both possibilities offer detector sensitivities below current offerings of around 10 million electronvolts. The lower limit for light, ""warm"" dark matter is around 1,000 electronvolts. The idea behind the helium superfluid detector is that the incoming superlight dark matter particle doesn't just couple to one collision event. Instead, the one incoming particle is able to yield several interactions—enough to be detected. This is part of quirkiness of superfluidic materials, which are able to flow without losing kinetic energy thanks to their complete absence of viscosity. Somewhat famously, superfluidic helium has the bizarre capability of creeping up the walls of its container and leaking away. So, the incoming superlight DM particles can couple to the superfluid without burning off kinetic energy—that is, without stopping. A similar sort of thing happens in a metallic superconductor, which is the basis of the detector described in Zurek's second paper. Here, current is able to flow without resistance in much the same way that the superfluid is able to flow without viscosity. The difference detector-wise is that the superlight dark matter particles interact with pairs of electrons rather than atomic nuclei. The pairs are split and the result are particle-like sound waves called phonons. Because the electrons in a superconductor are already moving at velocities faster than those expected of a superlight dark matter particle, the momentum of the incoming DM particles isn't ""lost"" in the collision event and they can be observed as particles in the superconductor recoil from the collision. The superconductor method will only work with dark matter particles that are able to couple to electrons, which means that they interact to some extent electromagnetically and are thus not so dark. As odd as it sounds, light-based dark matter hasn't been excluded from the hunt. The superfluid-based detector would presumably be bagging more conventional dark-dark matter particles, albeit very light ones. In any case, as dark matter searches across the globe continue to come up dry, it's clear that we need more tools.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pgkx88/supermaterials-offer-new-means-of-searching-for-superlight-dark-matter,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,624
2016-11-21 20:00:00,2016,11.0,21,"We Have Two Record Hot Days For Every Record Cold Day, and It’s Getting Worse","Whenever there's a daily cold temperature record broken someone on the planet, climate change deniers delight in pointing to it as evidence that global warming isn't real. The reality is that even as the planet continues to warm, record cold days will still appear. But if we continue down the path of current global greenhouse gas emissions, those record cold temperatures will be outpaced by record hot days 15 to one, according to a new study. ""You say the temperature's going to warm up two or three degrees and people just shrug their shoulders and say 'so what?'"" said Gerald Meehl, lead author of the paper and a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. ""But in fact, when you look at the extremes, you see how people experience climate change."" Meehl and his colleagues made this prediction by first collecting temperature records from weather stations across the United States from 1930 through 2015, according to the study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. But before we dig into their findings, it's helpful to understand a statistical relationship that occurs with record temperatures. If you imagine placing a weather station in your backyard this January 1, at the end of this year you would have 365 record high temperatures and 365 record low temperatures, because these are the only temperatures you've ever recorded. Statistically, in the second year you'd have half that—182 record cold days, and 182 record hot days—according to Meehl. By year three, you'd have a third as many record days, and so on. With this understanding, the researchers calculated a baseline of expected number of record hot and cold days for a given period of time: they chose to look at averages across ten-year periods, because the numbers can fluctuate a lot from year to year. The data reflected this expectation, until about 1980, when the number of hot days started to outpace the number of cold days. Statistically, the ratio between record hot days and record cold days ought to be 1:1 but by 2000-2009, it was actually 2:1, meaning for every record cold day, we got two record hot days. This decade obviously isn't finished, but the ratio is continuing to widen. Meehl and his co-authors used statistical modeling to project just how wide the ratio would get if we continue along the current path and found that, by about 2065, the ratio would increase to 15:1. That means in less than 50 years, we would be having 15 record hot days for every one record cold day. ""Even with a lot of warming, we still see record minimum temperature,"" Meehl told me. ""Winter still comes. We still have record minimum temperatures being set, but there's many more record highs. But the idea is that we're shifting the odds to a better chance of record heat and a reduced chance of record cold, that's what climate change is like."" The findings shouldn't come as a shock to anyone acutely concerned about the effects of climate change, and the good news is this increased ratio of record-breaking hot days can be slowed if we do literally anything at all to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. But it's yet another stark reminder of the impact a warming planet will have on our lives if we don't act now.

          Britain's prosecution service said it would examine whether criminal charges could be brought following the deaths at Gosport War Memorial Hospital in southern England.
           (Google) More than 450 patients died prematurely in a British hospital after they were given powerful painkillers with no medical justification, in what a damning report on Wednesday found was a “disregard for human life”. Britain’s prosecution service said it would examine whether criminal charges could be brought following the deaths at Gosport War Memorial Hospital in southern England. An independent panel found that between 1989 and 2000, there was an institutionalized regime of prescribing and administering dangerous doses of opioids at the hospital which were not clinically necessary. “There was a disregard for human life and a culture of shortening the lives of a large number of patients,” the report said, adding that warnings from nurses had been ignored and there had been a failure by police and medical regulators to protect patients. WOMAN CLAIMS BOTCHED IMPLANT SURGERY LEFT HER WITH BACTERIAL INFECTION, SEVERE SCARRING “The families, and indeed the nation as a whole, are entitled to ask how these events could have happened,” it added. The 387-page report concluded that 456 patients were given opioids without justification and “probably at least another 200 patients similarly affected but whose clinical notes were not found”. “The events at Gosport Memorial Hospital were tragic, they are deeply troubling, and they brought unimaginable heartache to the families concerned,” Prime Minister Theresa May said in parliament. “The findings are obviously distressing.” Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt apologized in parliament to the families, and said police would work with the prosecutors on possible charges. “Had the establishment listened when ordinary families raised concerns... many of those deaths would not have happened,” he said. MOM WARNS ON VENOMOUS CATERPILLARS AFTER SON&aposS HARROWING MEDICAL SCARE The report noted the Gosport deaths and the concerns raised about them occurred at the same time as it was revealed that British family physician Harold Shipman, dubbed “Dr Death” had been responsible for killing patients in his care with lethal heroin injections. Shipman, convicted in 2000 for murdering 15 patients, killed as many as 250 people in his care according to a later inquiry. But the panel examining the Gosport scandal said the circumstances were different. “We draw a distinction because Harold Shipman acted alone, apparently, whereas what we are describing ... in this report is an institutionalized practice, and that is a significant difference,” Reverend James Jones, the chairman of the independent panel, told reporters.",https://www.foxnews.com/health/unjustified-medication-shortened-456-lives-in-a-uk-hospital-report-says,Health Care,Fox News,health,419

Still, Graham connected with everyone he met, from elderly patients to younger children.  ""He would lend other sick children his toys or act silly to make them laugh,"" Morissette said. ""Graham's special spirit is what kept me going. He helped me have the energy and the strength to fight with him.""  In 1997, when he was 8 years old, Graham passed away.  Inspired by how Graham lived his life caring about others, Morissette founded the nonprofit Grahamtastic Connection in his honor. The organization provides free technology -- including computers, iPads, and now robots -- to children battling cancer and other serious illnesses.  Since 1998, the group has helped more than 1,500 children throughout the country stay connected to the outside world and continue their education.  CNN's Laura Klairmont spoke with Morissette about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation. CNN: How does the technology you provide help these kids? Morissette: (It) keeps children from feeling isolated. It connects them to their family, their friends and their classrooms. It really helps them heal emotionally and physically at the same time. When Graham was home, the computer definitely helped him stay in contact with his school and his medical team and friends. However, that was almost 20 years ago when the internet was really in its infancy. Kids now have the ability to be so much more connected using new technology like FaceTime and social media.  I find that most seriously ill children just want to be normal kids. They want be in school and they want to be with their classmates. So, we're providing the tools that enable that.  CNN: Tools like the robots! What do the robots allow the kids to experience?  Morissette: One of our major goals is to connect kids to their classrooms, which really helps them continue their education despite hospitalizations and days missed from school. We've been providing robots since 2012, and the robot technology is really cool.  The robots transport the child right into the classroom in real time. They can operate the robot right from their hospital bed or home. So, if a child is unable to attend school, they can simply log on to their tablet or laptop and call in to the robot.  They can walk up and down the halls. They can go to lunch with their friends. The real magic happens between classes, when they're walking down the hallway with their friends, by robot, talking about their weekend and their favorite foods and just all the kid stuff. It connects them to their friends, their classmates, and their teachers.  It's neat technology that really gives children the feeling of control, where their world is maybe out of control. CNN: What inspires you to continue this work?  Morissette: My hope is just to make the lives of these children a little bit better, a little bit easier. This work is not even really work; it's my path, it's my calling. I can't imagine doing anything else. I love working with these children.  Every time I can help a child in need, I feel as though Graham is smiling down, I like to say, his angel wings fluttering. It's really important for me to keep my son's memory alive. Graham was such a special boy; he was just beyond his years. He always liked to help other people and do kind and thoughtful things. He was full of love. He had a very special light inside of him; you could almost see it glowing from his heart. I believe that Graham's love lives on in the work that I do. And I'm proud and privileged to be able to do it in his honor.  Want to get involved? Check out the Grahamtastic Connection website and see how to help.

2016-03-17 13:30:04,2016,3.0,17,"Cities to Untangle Traffic Snarls, With Help From Alphabet Unit","Wheels MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — In a world where taxi rides are summoned with a button and where people have become reliant on mapping applications to get around town, a paradox has emerged: Technology companies know a lot more about a city’s traffic patterns than the city officials trying to solve the problem. On Thursday, the federal Department of Transportation announced a partnership with Sidewalk Labs, a unit of Alphabet, the same technology conglomerate that owns Google, that aims to funnel transit data to city officials in hopes of making traffic more bearable and figuring out newer, smarter ways of moving people and goods around the country’s urban areas. The announcement is part of an continuing “Smart City” competition in which the Transportation Department is dangling $40 million in grant money in front of cities to prod them into using more technology. As part of the deal, Sidewalk will work with seven finalists to develop a traffic management system that will be one of the company’s core software products. “We’re taking everything from anonymized smartphone data from billions of miles of trips, sensor data, and bringing that into a platform that will give both the public and private parties and government the capacity to actually understand the data in ways they haven’t before,” said Daniel L. Doctoroff, Sidewalk’s chief executive, who is a former deputy mayor of New York City and former chief executive of Bloomberg. Sidewalk was hatched out of Google last June as an independent company that will use technology to solve urban problems — yet another example of how the Internet giant has strayed far and wide from its initial mission in online search. The company is based in New York and was conceived by Mr. Doctoroff, along with a team of Google employees led by Larry Page, one of Google’s founders and now Alphabet’s chief executive. In June, Sidewalk announced that it would help finance a company called Intersection that is installing thousands of Wi-Fi kiosks across New York City, but the company has otherwise said little about its aspirations or what kinds of technologies it might develop. Thursday’s announcement gave some insights. As part of the Transportation Department competition, Sidewalk will work with the seven finalists to develop a software platform called Flow to help cities diagnose and fix congestion problems. Flow looks a lot like Google Maps, and the search giant’s mapping data is at the core of the product. But the idea is to help cities dive deeper. The Flow system makes inferences about where people are coming from or going, so planners could tap on a congested road segment and find out what kind of traffic — morning commuters, for example, or weekend traffic to a baseball game — was contributing to the problem. They would also be able to run virtual experiments such as how much traffic would be reduced if they added a bus route or car pool lane along the choke point. Sidewalk is still figuring out how it will try to make money from the system, but it is likely to use a subscription-based model in which cities pay for different tiers of data and higher levels of analytic and diagnostic abilities. Mr. Doctoroff said this idea of partnering — with private companies, but also governments — will be central to how he builds Sidewalk. “Our mission is basically to leverage technology to solve big urban problems,” he said. “And often, in fact I would argue most often, the path by which you do that goes through at least one level of government.” The Transportation Department introduced its Smart City Challenge in December, and by February, it had 78 proposals for new ways to use data and technology to improve transportation. Most large and medium-size American cities applied. The winner will receive $40 million to carry out its proposal. The first round of applications was due in February. The Transportation Department announced the seven finalists — Columbus, Ohio; Kansas City, Mo.; Pittsburgh; Denver; Portland, Ore.; San Francisco; and Austin, Tex. — last weekend at the South by Southwest music, film and technology festival. Those finalists will now work with each other and Sidewalk to fine-tune their proposals, which, in turn, will help Sidewalk figure out what kinds of features or analytics to build into the Flow system. In addition to the $40 million check, the eventual winner, which will be announced in June, will receive various perks like use of the Flow system and 100 Wi-Fi kiosks that will provide free Internet in parts of the city. “Empowering disadvantaged communities to take advantage of technology and innovation is a key component of the Smart City Challenge,” Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in an emailed statement.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/18/technology/cities-to-untangle-traffic-snarls-with-help-from-alphabet-unit.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,787

The internet and media holding company reported revenue of $995 million, versus the $935 million analysts expected. (The company also reported GAAP diluted EPS of 71 cents.) ""We respect the power of Facebook's network – as consumers and partners we have been great beneficiaries of their mission to connect the world,"" Levin wrote in the note. ""However, on the long list of things we worry about in our dating business, [Facebook launching a dating app] doesn't top the list. "" His sentiments echoed those of Match CEO Mandy Ginsberg who told investors on a Wednesday morning conference call Match isn't worried about Facebook encroaching on the business. According to Ginsberg, people don't want to mix their online dating life with the friends-and-family-first Facebook. In his note to investors, Levin came across as cautious, but resolved and ready to gear up for a fight to maintain dominance in the space. ""Facebook can give up and scrap their dating project anytime, but that's not an option for us – it's our life. The only option for us is to help more people build relationships. If we continue to do that better every day, and willingly disrupt ourselves...we will win,"" Levin wrote. ""We have a 23-year head start and several months advanced warning, and we're going to take advantage of all of it,"" he added. As Facebook has had an unofficial reputation for bringing people together ""since it was a project in Mark Zuckerberg's dorm room at Harvard,"" Levin said the announcement served as more of a wake-up call to continue to ""delight our users"" and deliver innovative products. ""A single new competitor, even a powerful one cannot just uproot us -- our fate is in our own hands,"" Levin wrote. Shares of IAC and its social business Match Group, tanked earlier this month after Facebook announced it is prepping a separate dating feature to live inside the core Facebook app. The service includes an event-based system for pairing that's unique to the space. Facebook's dating feature will pair users that aren't already friends, while keeping dating profiles private from friends on the larger platform.

Now, Facebook has rolled out a tool that lets users see exactly which third-party apps and websites share their data with Facebook. The tool also includes a toggle to turn this off. To access the new feature: Once in, this page will show you which apps and websites are feeding data to Facebook. You can tap on each app for additional information about how it is sharing data with Facebook, what type of data it is sharing, and what Facebook is doing with that data. These pages will also allow you to download the activity details of what is being shared with Facebook. From the ""Manage Your Off-Facebook Activity"" page, you can delete the third-party websites that have shared with Facebook by simply tapping on the large ""Clear History"" button at the top of the screen. But this will do little to stop the apps from sharing information with Facebook going forward. To prevent future data sharing, you can either turn everything off or you can turn off data sharing app by app. If you want to be selective about which apps you prevent, simply click an app that you want off, scroll down and select ""Turn off future activity."" Repeat this for each website that you want to turn off. To turn off future data sharing in bulk, click on ""Manage Future Activity,"" which will prompt a pop up where you should click ""Manage Future Activity.""

2020-03-27 00:00:00,2020,3.0,27,Abortion provision thrown into doubt by coronavirus pandemic,"London (CNN)As the coronavirus pandemic sweeps the globe, women's access to abortion is one of many healthcare provisions thrown into jeopardy. The UK government caused confusion this week when it first announced that women would temporarily be allowed to access early medical abortion at home, rather than attending a clinic -- and then, hours later, reversed its decision. In the United States, Mississippi, Ohio and Texas are including abortions among nonessential surgical procedures that must be deferred or canceled as coronavirus cases flood the health care system. State officials say the steps are necessary to preserve protective supplies that are becoming increasingly precious as the pandemic worsens. But abortion-rights groups have decried the actions, saying officials are exploiting a public health crisis to advance a political agenda. Abortions are still allowed in Texas during this time if they are ""medically necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother,"" a press release from the state's attorney general said. In Ohio, the deputy attorney general sent letters last Friday and Saturday to three abortion providers, directing them to comply with the state health director's executive order to stop performing non-essential procedures to preserve protective supplies. The governor of Mississippi said he would take action if the state's single clinic was providing elective abortions after the state health department required that non-essential surgery be postponed. More than 5,000 miles away, in Italy's worst-affected region, Lombardy, some struggling hospitals have closed their abortion services and are sending women to other hospitals for care, the head of a gynecologists' association that supports abortion rights told CNN. The move has greatly complicated abortion access for women in those areas, said Dr. Silvana Agatone, president of LAIGA.  Although abortions are considered urgent medical interventions, under Italian law each region is allowed to handle the provision as it sees fit, Agatone said. Her group had not yet been able to speak with the health minister about a national response, she added. The Italian health ministry has not yet responded to CNN's request for comment.  Meanwhile, two abortion rights advocate groups in Germany have warned that women's health and lives are being put at risk as restrictions on movement and counseling center closures limit their access to abortion services. UK reversal Abortion providers pressed the UK government Wednesday to rethink its position.  The UK Department of Health and Social Care had told abortion providers Monday that women seeking an abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy could take both pills needed for a termination at home rather than having to go to a clinic to take the first one. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), a charity which helps nearly 100,000 women a year with pregnancy counseling and abortion care, welcomed the step at a time when UK citizens have been largely banned from leaving their homes to help prevent the virus' spread. But within hours, the government rolled back the change outlined in the letter sent to abortion providers, BPAS said, and the new guidance was removed from the government's website. Asked about the issue Tuesday in the House of Commons, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""We have no proposals to change any abortion rules as part of the Covid-19 response."" BPAS' chief executive, Ann Furedi, tweeted her consternation at what she labeled a U-turn, saying the new measures were needed to keep legal abortion available as Britain responds to the coronavirus threat.  ""Dozens of clinic staff are sick or self-isolating. This is no time to play politics with abortion. Let us provide safe care,"" she said. Her tweet included an image of the letter sent to abortion providers Monday. BPAS said Wednesday that nearly a quarter of its clinics were now closed due to staff sickness and isolation measures.  ""In the next 13 weeks as the pandemic reaches its peak, at least 44,000 women will have to leave their homes needlessly to access care,"" it said in a statement. ""Women with severe health issues who have been told to self-isolate say they are being forced to choose between risking their health by leaving their house and being compelled to continue an unwanted pregnancy that also threatens their health."" Marie Stopes International, another abortion provider in the UK and elsewhere, also condemned the government's reversal of its decision to allow women to access early medical abortion from home, saying it was ""cruel, irresponsible, and puts lives in danger."" Opposition Labour MPs Stella Creasy and Diana Johnson backed the organizations' call for the government to think again. The Department of Health and Social Care did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. UK media reports quoted the department as saying the announcement of the policy change had been published in error. 'Acute risk' Meanwhile, abortions are still happening in Germany, according to CNN's German affiliate RTL, but women face delays in accessing counseling centers -- a requirement there before terminating a pregnancy. Groups including abortion rights advocate organizations Pro Familia and Doctors for Choice wrote an open letter Sunday to doctors performing abortions in which they warned that ""access to abortions is now at acute risk"" because of the restrictions imposed to help contain the pandemic. Closures or reduced opening hours for counseling centers have led to serious delays for women seeking the required in-person counseling appointment before any abortion takes place, the letter warns. They may also struggle to get to clinics providing abortions because of travel restrictions.  These issues mean that women may no longer meet the legal deadline by which a legal termination is permitted, the letter states, and increases the risk that women will resort to ""unsafe abortion methods."" The abortion rights advocate organizations urge federal and state governments and health insurers to make it possible for all women to seek advice by video or telephone, rather than having to attend counseling appointments in person. CNN has reached out to the German government for comment. France commits to access Officials in France and Spain have sought to reassure women that their reproductive healthcare rights will be protected. The head of France's national health agency, Jérôme Salomon, last week insisted that the country's abortion centers would remain open during the crisis despite tight restrictions on people's movements. Salomon again stressed France's commitment to ensuring women retain access to vital services during the country's lockdown in a news conference on Tuesday. ""We want to uphold women's sexual and reproductive rights. Access to the contraceptive pill will be maintained. Medical monitoring for pregnancies must continue to be ensured, including the three necessary ultrasound scans. We are exploring the possibilities of doing this through video calls,"" he said. In Spain, the Association of Clinics Accredited for the Voluntary Interruption of Pregnancy tweeted that its clinics remained open because abortion is part of the country's national health provision. ""It's an urgent resource which cannot be postponed and should be attended to promptly,"" the association said. Other abortion clinics in Spain also tweeted that they were continuing their work.

2016-04-24 21:24:00,2016,4.0,24,NASA Plans a Journey to the Ocean at the Center of an Icy Moon,"Jules Verne enthralled generations of readers with the science fiction classic Journey to the Center of the Earth. In this epic tale, Professor Otto Lidenbrock and crew descend into an Icelandic volcano in the name of science. Now, a team of researchers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory propose that spelunking robots could similarly explore the subsurface oceans of icy moons.  Each year the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts Program (NIAC) reviews visionary ideas that could change the future of space travel. NIAC revises what is possible by using technological developments to transform science fiction into science fact. Recently, NASA announced its 2016 Phase 1 mission concepts.  ""The 2016 NIAC Phase I competition was fierce, as usual. All of the final candidates were outstanding, and limiting the choice to what fit in our budget was difficult,"" said Jason Derleth, NIAC program executive. ""We hope each new study will push boundaries and explore new approaches—that's what makes NIAC unique.""  Mars is traditionally pegged as the best place to look for life beyond Earth as the red planet was once Earth-like. However, there may be better options—such as Europa or Enceladus—further out into the Solar System. The two frosty moons (orbiting the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn respectively), both harbor subsurface oceans beneath a frozen exterior, which could be ideal for hosting life.  With a thick icy crust—as much as 62 miles (100 km) thick—Europa would present some issues for a drilling robot to reach the subsurface ocean. As such, researchers have turned their sights to Saturn's snowball moon, Enceladus. The tiny moon features a tantalizing terrain, with geyser-like plumes and surface scars (known as tiger stripes), which could provide the best point of access for a robotic probe.  Perhaps one of this year's most promising NIAC proposals was submitted by a team of researchers from JPL and proposes using robots to explore one of the icy moons, Jules Verne style. The Icy-Moon Cryovolcano Explorer (ICE, for short) aims to land on one of these moons and send a robotic explorer down the shaft of an ice volcano, where it will ultimately deploy a submersible to explore the ocean below.  Like the nesting dolls of science payloads, ICE would feature three modules, each needing to be deployed by the previous one. A surface module (SM) would land near the south pole of Enceladus and then deploy a descent module (DM) that would act much like a human alpinist. The team analyzed data from the plume and determined that the density of the material spewing out would not prohibit the DM from rappelling into the cavernous fissures. Once it reaches the subsurface ocean, the DM would release an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to explore the salty depths of Enceladus' ocean.  ICE could be the future of exploring ocean worlds as it has unique advantages over drilling proposals. First, it allows for in-situ science within a cryovolcanic vent. NASA's Cassini spacecraft sampled the plumes of Enceladus, but larger material typically doesn't reach orbital height. Mineral grains larger than 1 micron are especially important as they can provide the biggest insight into habitability.  Second, descending into an already open fissure provides easier entry to the ocean below and allows for a higher chance of mission success than those that must drill or burrow through layers of thick ice.  Lastly, the ICE mission concept enables the submersible or AUV to explore the oceans of icy moons unhindered by facilitating communication and power to the AUV. Water interferes with communication and localization (how the submersible knows where it is), so ICE proposes the use of acoustic communication rather than radio waves. The DM will also act as a charging station for the AUV, thus eliminating the need for an RTG or other bulky power source.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/aek3kg/nasa-plans-a-journey-to-the-center-of-an-icy-moon,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,626
2017-04-13 00:00:00,2017,4.0,13,U.S. FDA warns Abbott Labs over heart device problems,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning letter to Abbott Laboratories, citing manufacturing flaws with a range of cardiovascular devices acquired with its purchase of St. Jude Medical in January for $25 billion. The letter, dated April 12 and made public on Thursday, sent Abbott’s shares down 2 percent to $42.61. The FDA, which said the company failed to disclose at least one death associated with one of the devices, said an inspection of the company’s facility in Sylmar, California, raised questions about the safety of several implantable defibrillators and its Merlin@home monitor, which allows doctors to care remotely for patients with cardiac devices. The FDA investigation showed that lithium batteries in the devices were draining prematurely and that the company had “underestimated the occurrence of the hazardous situation.” Abbott said in a statement it has a “strong history and commitment to product safety and quality.” It said the FDA’s inspection took place in February and that Abbott responded on March 13 describing corrective actions it was taking. “We take these matters seriously, continue to make progress on our corrective actions, will closely review FDA’s warning letter, and are committed to fully addressing FDA’s concerns,” the company said. The FDA said Abbott had provided implementation dates for several corrective actions but failed to provide evidence that the actions had actually been implemented. Analysts said the FDA may now delay approval of new devices that can be used inside an MRI machine that the company had expected to see approved by the end of the year. That could help rivals Medtronic Plc, which has such devices on the market and Boston Scientific Corp which expects to launch similar devices in the fourth quarter. “These two companies stand to benefit in the event Abbott’s approvals are delayed,” Glenn Novarro, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note. The affected devices, known as implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators (CRT-Ds) help pace slow heart rhythms and slow dangerously fast rhythms. In October St. Jude said it would recall certain models due to reports of battery failure caused by deposits of lithium forming within the battery and causing a short circuit. In its letter, the FDA said the company repeatedly concluded that the cause of premature depletion “could not be determined” even though the company’s supplier had provided evidence that it was due to lithium deposits, known as lithium cluster bridging.

But on one condition: Drivers, after first coming to a full stop at the light, must believe that the red light is malfunctioning before driving through it. If that sounds like an invitation to roll up to every red light and keep on trucking, that's not the intention. But many worry that's exactly what will happen. ""I don't know if it's the wisest decision. People are already in a hurry going nowhere anyway,"" driving instructor Charlie Allen told CNN affiliate WBNS. Police aren't happy about it either. They've seen more than their fair share of red light crashes, and they don't want to see this new law create a bunch of new ones. ""This is about safety,"" Kettering, Ohio, police officer John Jung told CNN affiliate WHIO.

2016-09-04 18:00:00,2016,9.0,4,The Dark Cloud of High-Energy Physics,"It's been a month since physicists at the Large Hadron Collider dashed the hopes of a great many physicists and physics spotters that a new particle had appeared in collision data collected during the experiment's 2015 run. This was the 750 GeV diphoton resonance, an unexplained spike in the production of photon pairs with energies of around 750 gigaelectronvolts. There, in the particle detritus following the extreme high-energy collisions occurring between pairs of protons, was something unexplained. And, given the current state of particle physics research, something unexplained would have been fucking fantastic. The 750 GeV diphoton resonance would go on to spawn 547 theory papers attempting to explain it. The excitement was justifiable. Physics has hit an uncomfortable impasse. This concerns the Standard Model of particle physics, a handy self-consistent description of the particles and forces that make up much of our reality, but not all of it. While the discovery of the Higgs boson filled in a crucial Standard Model gap—thus reinforcing its predictive value for experimental phenomena—the Model doesn't have much to say about the biggest lingering mysteries of physics today: dark energy, dark matter, gravity, neutrino oscillations, matter-antimatter asymmetry. It's incomplete. This incompleteness is the essence of the hunt for New Physics, or physics that can't be explained by the Standard Model. Physics in 2016 is in dire need of mysterious events, such as the 750 GeV bump. This is why the mood since the August 5 announcement that said bump has not reappeared in 2016 LHC data has been so grim. Everyone went chasing after this (very convincing) mirage of a new unexplained particle only to find just more Standard Model sand. At Backreaction, physicist and writer Sabine Hossenfelder sums it up: As for the authors behind those 547 papers, a research physicist who blogs under the name ZapperZ wrote following the August announcement: ""They had just created an explanation for the existence of the unicorn ... I guess that people would rather be FIRST to be correct rather than be cautious and not appear foolish. After all, how many of us would remember that such-and-such wrote a paper to explain something that never existed in the first place?"" Fair enough. The dark cloud is about more than just some unanswered questions. It's about the thing itself: how we're even supposed to be thinking about fundamental physics. In particular, the ""failure"" to find physics beyond the Higgs boson at the LHC is an affront to something more philosophical and, well, old. This is ""naturalness."" Physics should be natural. Physics should be simple and beautiful. We should find coincidences in the fundamental laws of nature and those coincidences should point toward some satisfying aesthetic order. This is what we're told about the world, generally: That if we can ascribe to a natural, unmessy ordering of things, we will be more healthy and clear-headed. We will travel with the current of something deep and important instead of against it. In elegance, everything will just lock into place. In physics, naturalness takes the form of numerical coincidence. The idea, which relates to quantum field theory, is technical, but the high-level sense is that the various numerical constants governing the universe shouldn't look too contrived. This is the appeal of the Standard Model, where everything just locks together, naturally. Except it doesn't. The mass of the Higgs boson looks really contrived. It's small—despite endowing particles with masses potentially on the order of millions of billions of TeV, the Higgs boson as observed at the LHC weighs in at just .125 TeV. Like, somehow the Higgs boson started out with just enough mass to leave the universe as we see it, but no more. It's not the sort of thing you look at and can imagine ""just happened."" It's unnatural. There must be something else we're not seeing. So, by extending the Standard Model, there's hope for resolving this unnaturalness, but physicists like Hossenfelder think that chasing after ""natural"" explanations is part of the problem. ""That the LHC hasn't seen evidence for new physics is to me a clear signal that we've been doing something wrong, that our experience from constructing the standard model is no longer a promising direction to continue,"" she writes. ""We've maneuvered ourselves into a dead end by relying on aesthetic guidance to decide which experiments are the most promising."" That is, attempting to resolve the Standard Model in accordance with some illusory nature will only make our problems worse. We're not quite at a dead end, however, when it comes to the Standard Model. The LHC is producing statistics about a parameter relating to the Higgs boson known as tth production. This has to do with coupling between the Higgs and a particle known as the top quark. Current data shows this to be quite a bit out of whack with what's predicted by the Standard Model, though, as noted last week at the Résonaances blog, this, like the 750 GeV bump, is likely to be a statistical smudge as well. Still, it might soon become fodder for the next barrage of speculative physics papers. Dark clouds portend rain, which washes things away, I guess. ""Failures"" as are they've always been in physics and science in general. By saying what something isn't, you're that much closer to saying what it is. The only real failure is not doing the experiment in the first place.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wnx45q/the-dark-cloud-of-high-energy-physics,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,899

If a Facebook page is found to be repeatedly sharing false stories, the company will ban the page from advertising on Facebook. The company uses third-party fact-checking organizations to flag stories that are false. Under Facebook’s rules, advertisers are already not allowed to run ads that link to false stories, but this new update takes that ban a step further. In a blog post, the company says it is cracking down on the “instances of Pages using Facebook ads to build their audiences in order to distribute false news more broadly.”  This latest effort is aimed at keeping these false news pages from making money. But if an offending page stops sharing false stories, Facebook says the page may become eligible to run ads again. Since the 2016 US presidential election, Facebook’s various initiatives combating fake news have included monitoring suspicious accounts that spread fake news and taking out prints ads in the UK advising people how to spot fake news. In today’s announcement, Facebook says misinformation is harmful, and calls out Pages who spread fake news for making the world “less informed.”",https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/28/16215780/facebook-false-viral-hoaxes-trump-malicious-suspicious,Tech,The Verge,technology,198
2017-09-29 17:00:00,2017,9.0,29,"Once I Stopped Using Drugs and Alcohol, I Sought the High From Sex","I have been in and out of 12-step programs for the last 20 years. My road to any lasting sobriety has been rough and unpaved, to say the least: six rehabs, four psych wards, four suicide attempts, multiple ER visits, endless therapy, a slew of sponsors.  Much of these adventures as a ""relapse queen"" I used as material on stage as stand-up comedian (as the saying goes ""tragedy plus time equals comedy""). However, when I really bottomed out in 2011, I began chronicling my trials and tribulations in real time as an irreverent addiction journalist for The Fix. Looking back over my career as a struggling sober person, I began to notice a pattern: Once I put down the drugs and alcohol, I'd become fixated on sex and love.  The first two years of this last sobriety, starting in 2013, proved to be no different. I really went down a sexual rabbit hole in a compulsive and terrifying way I never had before. I had been arrested while high for felony domestic violence and the aftermath of that delightful event was a really messy divorce and a criminal trial (thanks a lot, OxyContin!).  While I was going through all of that, (enter nervous breakdown number three), the feelings and desires that once had me drinking Four Lokos or smoking meth now had me boning random 20-somethings in the backseat of my Passat. I hoped it was just divorce backlash or the steroid version of that classic ""seeking love and validation,"" but I could feel in my junkie heart that it was that old primal desire to ""get out.""  My lifelong operating system of checking out and muting my feelings didn't suddenly go away because I got sober. Without my ""medicine,"" I quickly found new ways to avoid myself and muzzle the inner voices that told me I was a loser, unlovable, a fuck-up. To somebody who's accustomed to high highs and low lows, new sobriety can feel well, boring and uneventful, and more than that, extremely uncomfortable. Feelings I'd ducked or anesthetized for decades with substances suddenly started to surface with an overwhelming ferocity. Sex was my go-to but I certainly didn't hesitate to use/abuse caffeine, nicotine, shopping, or food. In my new memoir, My Fair Junkie, I write, ""All my addictions have the same formula: I put something in my body, and I change my feelings. It doesn't matter if it's a donut or a Xanax or a cock."" I was so ill at ease in my own skin and so horrified at the charred remnants of my life, I sought solace in the arms of strangers on Tinder as well as B, C, and even D-list actors. If that didn't work, I always hit the jackpot with fellow horny AA'ers who were more than willing to bang the crazy new chick. A lot of them had the same void after putting down the needle or bottle. I desperately missed the rush of the scheming and sneaking, the lying and hiding, the buzz of scoring the drugs or ingesting the booze. Being sober felt bland, and moreover it allowed me no exciting distraction from, well, everything.  I rationalized all of my incredibly promiscuous behavior with ""at least I'm not using."" But as my lecherous ass soon landed me in Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous and even Sex Addicts Anonymous (yay, me and 12 guys in a church basement!), I began to understand why they referred to other people as ""2-legged dope."" The fleeting high of sexting with a new potential beau and the breathless trembling anticipation of driving to a rendezvous felt awfully similar to that high I'd get when on my way to meet the dealer. And of course, the day after, just like with drugs and booze, there was the comedown, filled with shame and remorse and confusion. Watch More From Tonic: I'm not the only one I've seen try to fill the gaping hole left by active substance abuse with sex and love (um, hello rehab romances). I asked Howard Wetsman, chief medical officer at Townsend Addiction Treatment Centers in Louisiana, whether there might be a biological component to this substitution behavior—or, as it's known in the program, ""whack-a-mole syndrome."" ""Since the 1930's when Dr. Silkworth included his opinion in Alcoholics Anonymous, we've known that people with addiction have a base state characterized by the words 'restless, irritable, and discontented,'"" Wetsman says. What we've only discovered more recently is that those symptoms map to lower levels of dopamine-receiving cells of the brain's reward center, he explains.  ""Whatever raises dopamine—drugs, alcohol, food, a hard job finished, sex, gambling, power over others—can be called on to fill the void when we stop using a drug,"" Wetsman says. ""At some point in recovery, because we no longer feel isolated or less than others, we gain enough dopamine receptors that many can avoid falling into this trap. But until that time, everyone is at risk for finding something else to take the place of the drug we just put down. But in addiction, there's no safe drug.""  That feeling I talked about getting on my way to the dealer has a biological explanation as well, Wetsman says. ""When we get any reminder of a reward, the amygdala—the part of the brain that remembers emotions—sends a signal to the reward center that [releases] dopamine,"" he says. ""We usually call that euphoric recall, but it's a real euphoria followed by a real crash that increases craving, just how everyone with addiction feels as they approach their high."" I was heartened to hear that there was a real biological component behind my substitutive behavior and not just a half-assed attempt at sobriety (or worse, some gruesome childhood wound of neediness). Now at four and a half years sober, I try to move myself toward the ""healthier"" highs: service, laughter, writing, exercise. And if I just can't muster the strength to do any of those and need an escape, I nap. But then again, I could be pathologizing: Maybe napping is just part of being in your 40s.  So while there are an abundance of 12-step programs focused on your problem of choice, they all stem from the same source: addiction. As I've worked on myself and stayed sober, many—dare I say most—of my compulsive behaviors have fallen away on their own. Except for binge-watching Ozark or The Handmaid's Tale. That's still a problem. Amy Dresner is a stand-up comedian and author of the new book My Fair Junkie: A Memoir of Getting Dirty and Staying Clean. Follow her on Twitter @AmyDresner.

2018-05-09 00:00:00,2018,5.0,9,China's Leshi questioned by bourse over trade suspension risk,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp Beijing has been formally asked whether its assets, which have fallen 98 percent over the past year, are at risk of turning negative and triggering a share trading halt and possible eventual delisting. The Shenzhen Stock Exchange’s website on Wednesday showed the bourse had sent Leshi 33 questions, including about its assets. Under its rules, a year of negative net assets results in “suspension from being a listed company”, with two years ending in delisting. Leshi, a video-streaming company that also makes internet-connected television sets, has seen revenue and profit dwindle since mid-2017 amid a funding crisis involving parent conglomerate LeEco and its founder Jia Yueting. Net assets attributable to shareholders stood at 304 million yuan ($47.70 million) at the end of March, from 13.6 billion yuan a year earlier. It reported a net loss of 307 million yuan for January-March 2018 and a loss of 13.9 billion yuan for all of 2017. The Shenzhen bourse also questioned Leshi about its operations, asset impairment and auditing. It asked the firm to detail its debts, explain slumping performance at subsidiaries, and disclose ownership relations with other companies as well as whether units conduct transactions with other group companies. It also asked for an update on Jia and his related parties’ repayment of debt to Leshi, and whether there has been a change in the company’s decision-making personnel. Leshi, which since July has been managed by second-largest shareholder Sunac China Holdings Ltd, in January said Jia and LeEco owed it 7.5 billion yuan. LeEco disputed the figure. Jia, who remains Leshi’s largest shareholder, has been residing in the United States to work on his electric vehicle start-up company, though Chinese regulators have requested his return. The Shenzhen exchange has also asked Leshi to explain how its salary expense rose in 2017 though headcount dropped. It has requested a reply from Leshi by May 18. A Leshi spokeswoman said the company had no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. Leshi’s shares were down 2.6 percent in morning trade in a flat broader market.

2016-07-07 00:00:00,2016,7.0,7,How HIV spread across the West," (CNN)In the 1980s, HIV took the world by surprise. The infection feigned a role as new and unknown but had established itself as a pandemic in other parts of the world, without anyone realizing.  Though the roots of the virus were soon discovered to lie in Africa, where a range of subtypes exist, one in particular -- subtype B -- was spreading rapidly around the globe, particularly in the West, and just how it spread was largely unknown -- until now. Scientists at the University of Oxford recently solved part of this mystery by analyzing thousands of genome sequences from viruses isolated in different parts of the world. Their study revealed North America to play an influential role in the pandemic and Europe to have been influenced, with the virus arriving in droves from other regions. ""Europe was absorbing the virus,"" said Gkikas Magiorkinis, a medical virologist at the University of Oxford who led the study. ""North America was actively letting the virus out."" Creating a flow North America was seen to be spreading the virus much more than importing it by transmitting it out of the continent and into Western Europe on multiple occasions. ""It wasn't just a random transition or single point of introduction; it was happening constantly,"" Magiorkinis said. He stressed that these are movements of the virus, not migrants. ""It's not immigrants causing this, as people going on holiday can get infected."" This continuous flow is, in part, thought to be due to certain countries being more influential than others, such as those in North America. A country is considered influential by having many connections to other parts of the world, as once any virus enters, it can then easily spread.  ""It was only when it entered the USA that it became a pandemic,"" Magiorkinis said. Internal travel In contrast, Europe was found to have absorbed constant flows of the virus from multiple regions of the world, including the United States. ""Within Europe, three countries had higher connections: the UK, France and Switzerland,"" Magiorkinis said. These connections saw these countries both releasing and absorbing the virus, but with greater numbers coming in, including from the United States. ""The critical issue is population-mixing and the fact people acquire, or spread, viruses associated with travel,"" said Chris Beyrer, professor of public health and human rights at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""There's a long history of blame for the spread of the epidemic ... but you have to improve control and treatment."" Multiple studies have shown the benefits of antiretroviral treatment in preventing transmission of HIV as levels of the virus can become undetectable once on treatment.  After arriving in Europe, the virus soon spread within the continent but with a clear segregation between Eastern and Western Europe as each side evolved its own pockets of the epidemic.  In Western Europe (as well as North America), HIV mainly affects gay communities, causing concentrated epidemics. In the UK, more than half of new HIV infections occurred among gay men in 2014, despite them making up an estimated 2% to 3% of the male population. But in Eastern Europe, the virus mainly infects injecting drug users, and transmission dynamics are quite different, as the virus is not spread sexually. This segregation of epidemics occurred until the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, when movement  -- and transmission --promptly changed. ""When the Soviet Union fell, we can see the virus in that area spilled over into Western Europe, probably due to migration,"" Magiorkinis said.  What it means The study was hypothetical and based on genetic analysis, so they cannot be proved. Beyrer also stresses that the Oxford team's findings have their limitations: ""It's a huge pandemic, and huge numbers are not provided in these samples. You couldn't infer much about the rest of the world from this study."" But the burden in Eastern Europe today has public health teams concerned, as this is one of only two regions in the world today where numbers infected with HIV are rising, and any insight into transmission can be used to better target resources. ""The future of HIV transmission in Europe is the East,"" Beyrer said. The study also reveals the ease with which HIV and other viruses can spread across the world, calling for more global solutions to the problem. ""Public health responses to HIV must be thought of as a global response, because you cannot stop movement between countries,"" Magiorkinis said. ""It's crucial to build health systems that provide access to treatment faster and reduce transmission.""

2019-04-03 00:00:00,2019,4.0,3,One in five deaths worldwide linked to unhealthy diet,"LONDON (Reuters) - Eleven million deaths worldwide in 2017 were linked to people eating poor diets high in sugar, salt and processed meat that contributed to heart disease, cancer and diabetes, a global study found. The research, published in the Lancet medical journal, found that among 195 countries studied, the proportion of diet-related deaths was highest in Uzbekistan and lowest in Israel. The United States ranked 43rd, while Britain was 23rd, China 140th and India 118th. Consumption of healthier foods such as nuts and seeds, milk and whole grains was on average too low, and people consumed too many sugary drinks and too much processed meat and salt. This led to one in five deaths in 2017 being linked to bad diets. The Global Burden of Disease study tracked trends from 1990 to 2017 of consumption of 15 dietary factors. Chris Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington which led the work, said it “affirms what many have thought for several years”. “Poor diet is responsible for more deaths than any other risk factor in the world,” he said. “Our assessment suggests the leading dietary risk factors are high intake of sodium, or low intake of healthy foods, such as whole grains, fruit, nuts and seeds and vegetables.” The study found people ate only 12 percent of the recommended amount of nuts and seeds - an average intake of 3 grams a day, compared with the recommended 21 g - and drank more than 10 times the recommended amount of sugary drinks. Diets high in sugar, salt and bad fats are known risk factors for heart disease, stroke, diabetes and many types of cancer. The global diet also included less than a quarter of the recommended amount of whole grains - at 29 g average intake a day compared with the recommended 125 g - and almost double the recommended amount of processed meat - at around 4 g average intake per day compared with the 2 g recommended. A study published in January suggested an “ideal diet” for the health of people and the planet would include a doubling of consumption of nuts, fruits, vegetables and legumes, and a halving of meat and sugar intake. In a breakdown of diet-related deaths, the study found that of the 11 million in 2017, almost 10 million were from cardiovascular diseases, around 913,000 from cancer, and almost 339,000 from type 2 diabetes. Annual deaths related to diet have increased from 8 million in 1990, but the researchers said this was largely due to increases in populations and populations aging.

2016-02-17 00:00:00,2016,2.0,17,Factbox: Why the Zika virus is causing alarm,"(Reuters) - Global health officials have said that the Zika virus, which has been linked to severe birth defects in thousands of babies in Brazil, is rapidly spreading in the Americas and could infect up to 4 million people. The race is on to develop a Zika vaccine. The following are some questions and answers about the virus and the current outbreak. How do people become infected? The virus is transmitted to people through the bite of infected female mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same type that spreads dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said Aedes mosquitoes are found in all countries in the Americas except Canada and continental Chile, and the virus will likely reach all countries and territories of the region where Aedes mosquitoes are found. How do you treat Zika infection? There is no treatment or vaccine available for Zika infection. Companies and scientists are racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine for Zika, but the World Health Organization said it would take at least 18 months to start large-scale clinical trials of potential preventative shots. How dangerous is it? The PAHO said there is no evidence that Zika can cause death, but some cases have been reported with more serious complications in patients with pre-existing medical conditions. The virus has been linked to microcephaly, a condition in newborns marked by abnormally small heads and brains that have not developed properly. It also has been associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks part of the nervous system. The suspected link between the Zika virus and the two conditions could be confirmed within weeks, the WHO said. How is Zika related to microcephaly? Much remains unknown about Zika, including whether the virus actually causes microcephaly. Brazil is investigating the potential link between Zika infections and more than 4,400 suspected cases of microcephaly, a condition marked by abnormally small head size that can result in developmental problems. Researchers have confirmed more than 500 of these cases as microcephaly and identified evidence of Zika infection in 41 of these cases, but have not proven that Zika can cause microcephaly. It is unclear whether in pregnant women the virus crosses the placenta and causes microcephaly. Research in Brazil indicates the greatest microcephaly risk appears to be associated with infection during the first trimester of pregnancy. What are the symptoms of Zika infection? People who get Zika virus disease typically have a mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and fatigue that can last for two to seven days. But as many as 80 percent of people infected never develop symptoms. The symptoms are similar to those of dengue or chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same type of mosquito. How can Zika be contained? Efforts to control the spread of the virus focus on eliminating mosquito breeding sites and taking precautions against mosquito bites such as using insect repellent and mosquito nets. U.S. and international health officials have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to Latin American and Caribbean countries where they may be exposed to Zika. How widespread is the outbreak? Zika outbreaks have been reported in at least 40 countries or territories, according to the WHO. Brazil has been the nation most affected. (bit.ly/20TLUlG) Africa (2): Cape Verde and Gabon Americas (26): Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Curaçao, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, Suriname, U.S. Virgin Islands and Venezuela Asia (12): American Samoa, Cambodia, Fiji, Indonesia, Maldives, Philippines, Malaysia, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Thailand, Tonga and Vanuatu What is the history of the Zika virus? The Zika virus is found in tropical locales with large mosquito populations. Outbreaks of Zika virus disease have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Southern Asia and the Western Pacific. The virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys and was first identified in people in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania, according to the WHO. Can Zika be transmitted through sexual contact? Two cases of possible person-to-person sexual transmission have been described, but the PAHO said more evidence is needed to confirm whether sexual contact is a means of Zika transmission. British health officials reported Zika was found in a man’s semen two months after he was infected, suggesting the virus may linger in semen long after infection symptoms fade. The WHO has advised women, particularly pregnant women, to use condoms. The PAHO also said Zika can be transmitted through blood, but this is an infrequent transmission mechanism. There is no evidence the virus can be transmitted to babies through breast milk. What other complications are associated with Zika? The WHO says because no big Zika outbreaks were recorded before 2007, little is known about complications caused by infection. During an outbreak of Zika from 2013-2014 in French Polynesia, national health authorities reported an unusual increase in Guillain-Barre syndrome. Health authorities in Brazil have also reported an increase in Guillain-Barre syndrome. Long-term health consequences of Zika infection remain unclear. Other uncertainties surround the incubation period of the virus and how Zika interacts with other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue.

2016-07-15 15:41:00,2016,7.0,15,Photos from the Frontlines of Fracking,"Improvements in hydraulic fracturing, popularly known as fracking, made previously hard-to-extract natural gas economically viable. Drill rigs sprang up across the Marcellus Formation, a shale deposit that lies beneath almost all of West Virginia and Pennsylvania as well as large swaths of Ohio and New York. Boosters trumpeted a cheap energy source that was cleaner than coal and created good-paying jobs; detractors warned of air and water pollution and the industrialization of rural America. Photographer Brian Cohen watched gas-extraction operations springing up in the countryside surrounding his home of Pittsburgh. ""This is a historic story, particularly in Pennsylvania, certainly the biggest shift in the energy landscape in Pennsylvania in multiple generations,"" Cohen said in an email. ""It is a story where you can see very clearly how the implementation of policy affects the lives of real people, regardless of whether you think it is for better or for worse."" Cohen formed the Marcellus Shale Documentary Project (MSDP) in 2011 with local photographers Lynn Johnson, Scott Goldsmith and Martha Rial, as well as Philadelphia-based Noah Addis and New Yorker Nina Berman, to investigate the contentious drilling practice. After touring in 2012, the group is back with a new member, documentary filmmaker and multimedia producer Joe Seamans, and another exhibition, expanding into Ohio and West Virginia and the geological neighbor of Marcellus, the Utica Shale.  With the help of environmental advocacy nonprofit FracTracker Alliance, the resulting work has become an exhibition of 80 prints, a screen for videos shot by Berman, three map visualizations and two multimedia presentations. Marcellus Shale Documentary Project: An Expanded View runs through the end of the month at Pittsburgh Center for the Arts and Cohen is optimistic that, just as it did last time, the exhibition will tour in the near future.

The government had provisionally agreed a $5.5 billion loan deal with the IMF in December but the money has not been disbursed yet and is contingent on Ukraine passing reforms and taking steps to tackle corruption. The turbulence from the coronavirus epidemic has dragged down the hryvnia currency and prompted the government to ask the IMF for additional emergency assistance. The government has not disclosed how much more money it would like. A previous crisis, triggered by Russia’s annexation of the Crimea peninsula in 2014 and the outbreak of conflict in the eastern Donbass region, prompted Ukraine to last restructure its debts in 2015. “As for today, questions about the restructuring of the commercial, interstate, internal, external, any debts are not discussed and have not been initiated,” Umansky told Reuters by phone early on Tuesday morning. In December, Kiev and the IMF reached a preliminary agreement about an Extended Fund Facility programme. Umansky said the government also discussed expanding the IMF’s financial assistance. “We are now talking about the main EFF programme. But within the framework of this programme, we are certainly holding discussions ... taking into account what is happening in Ukraine and the world, including the coronavirus.” (Reporting by Natalia Zinets; writing by Matthias Williams; Editing by Andrew Heavens)",https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-economy/ukraine-close-to-finishing-imf-loan-talks-but-wont-restructure-debt-finance-minister-idUSL8N2BH19K,Healthcare,Reuters,health,253

2018-09-24 00:00:00,2018,9.0,24,"Electrode treatment, physical therapy combination lets two paralyzed people walk again","(Reuters Health) - Doctors in Kentucky reported Monday that two of four paralyzed patients were able to walk again with limited assistance after treatment with electrical stimulation to the portion of the spinal cord cut off from the brain, combined with intense physical therapy. The technique is still experimental and relies in part on implantation of electrodes that seem to prime the largely-dormant part of the spinal cord to listen to faintly-echoed commands by the brain to walk. “We all walk independent of the brain in a sense because the human spinal circuitry is the primary controller of walking,” said Susan Harkema, a leader of the team from the University of Louisville whose report appears online in The New England Journal of Medicine. Below the level of a spinal cord injury, hundreds of thousands of nerve cells “are still alive and healthy and still connected in a network that controls movement” and allows walking with minimal input from the brain, she told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. The technique being used by her team re-energizes the walking function, although the patients still need some support because all the information needed to maintain balance — sensory information processed by the brain — still has trouble getting through. Like the other 1.27 million people paralyzed by a spinal cord injury in the United States, all four volunteers described in the new report were unable to walk or stand. All had been unable to move their legs for at least 2.5 years, although they did have some sensation below the site of their injury. For at least eight weeks, each volunteer spent two daily one-hour sessions, five days per week, on a treadmill with their weight supported in a harness as physical therapists moving their legs and feet in a walking motion. They were also trained to stand. That therapy alone did not allow them to stand or walk. A 16-electrode device used for pain control and not designed to help paralyzed patients walk was then implanted between a bone in their spine and the spinal cord, below the damaged area. After about 20 days to recover from surgery, the researchers worked to find the right pattern and intensity of electrode stimulation to activate standing and stepping movements as the volunteers focused on trying to perform those tasks. The third and fourth patients they enrolled, who received a combination of electrical stimulation and gait training for 85 weeks and 15 weeks respectively, could not only walk on a treadmill, they could walk on a regular surface assisted by a walker or horizontal poles to compensate for their residual balance problems. All four were able to stand independently with a walker and regained trunk stability. They lost those abilities as soon as the stimulator was turned off. Dr. Harkema, who is with the university’s Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center, said one problem is that the electronic stimulator was never designed for this purpose, so it is difficult to adjust on the fly to find the correct frequencies and intensities to sensitize patients to the faint signals coming from the brain. Medtronic, which makes the stimulator to combat pain, provided the equipment, but no additional support. The technique does not work in people whose spinal cords have been completely severed, she said.

2018-09-20 00:00:00,2018,9.0,20,FDA may accelerate review of e-cigs with features to prevent teen use,"The Food and Drug Administration is considering fast-tracking the review process for e-cigarettes that include features that make the products less likely to be used by kids, Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told CNBC on Thursday. Gottlieb last week announced a historic crackdown on e-cigarettes after reviewing unpublished federal data he's reviewed showing teen use has reached ""epidemic"" levels. The FDA ordered five brands — Juul, British American Tobacco's Vuse, Altria's MarkTen, Imperial Brands' Blu E-cigs and Japan Tobacco's Logic — to submit plans within 60 days detailing how they will prevent teens from using their products. Some manufacturers have said the agency's requirement that any new e-cigarettes must undergo review before entering the market prevents them from introducing new products that could curb youth use, including bluetooth features that could disable them near schools. Yet Gottlieb said while companies have talked about these ideas with reporters and politicians, they haven't raised them with the FDA. He said the door is ""very open to that kind of discussion."" ""I think if someone came to us with a good idea about how a product could be modified to be less appealing to kids or less prone to misuse by children, we'd be very interested in that product, and we'd be very interested in having a discussion around that and how we could put that through an efficient regulatory process,"" he said. Juul, the brand that dominates nearly 73 percent of the e-cigarette market, said it ""believes technology is absolutely part of the solution."" The company plans to launch bluetooth-enabled devices internationally next year, according to a person familiar with the matter. Products that were on the market before Aug. 8, 2016, were supposed to start undergoing review this year until Gottlieb extended the deadline until Aug. 8, 2022. He said Thursday that the FDA is actively considering reinstating the original deadline, meaning companies may soon be required to submit applications. It may also pull flavored e-cigarette products from the market until those applications are reviewed and cleared. Critics have scolded Gottlieb for ever giving e-cigarette companies more time. He said it was necessary because it wasn't clear what the FDA wanted from manufacturers. Now, a year later, the FDA has issued some guidelines and plans to soon release more. If he had kept the original date, companies would have started sending in applications and wouldn't have received a decision until next year. ""What we couldn't anticipate, and what we didn't anticipate, in all fairness, was how fast the youth use would accelerate,"" Gottlieb said. In his defense, Gottlieb said, if the agency hadn't done anything differently and kept the original application deadline, the growth of youth e-cigarette use in 2018 still would have happened. ""We'd still be where we are right now, which is having to contemplate what we're going to do to stem that use,"" he said.Since last week's announcement, the FDA has started reaching out to the five manufacturers to schedule meetings with Gottlieb and the agency's Center for Tobacco Products. While the companies put together their plans, Gottlieb said, the center will also create a comprehensive set of proposals for addressing youth use.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/20/fda-may-accelerate-review-of-e-cigs-with-features-to-prevent-teen-use.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,523

2017-05-19 17:00:00,2017,5.0,19,A Medieval Cow Bile Stew Could Teach Us How to Fight Modern Infections," Everything old is new again. Nowhere is that more true than in the research of a multidisciplinary team of scientists and medieval scholars who discovered that by replicating a treatment for a sty (an eyelash follicle infection) from a medical text from Anglo-Saxon times, they created a potent antibiotic for Methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).   Christina Lee, a professor of Viking studies at the University of Nottingham in the UK, never thought she would be part of a team that discovered a new antibiotic. ""Never in my wildest dreams,"" she says, with a laugh. The formula in the 10th century medical text, called ""Bald's Leechbook,"" involves mixing garlic, onion, wine, and cow bile in a brass vessel before letting the mixture sit for nine days to ferment. The resulting concoction, brewed up by the researchers in a modern glass container with a brass square placed in it to replicated a brass vessel, proved 90 percent effective in killing MRSA in laboratory testing, says Kendra Rumbaugh, a professor at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. Rumbaugh, who was part of the scientific team testing the formula the medieval scholars concocted, noted that vancomycin, the current treatment for MRSA, proved to be less effective a treatment in the team's experiment in a mouse chronic wound model.   While Lee was surprised by how well the recipe worked, she was not surprised that a medical text written well before the Enlightenment would prove useful. ""I have always believed in people being rational. I have always believed that people in the Middle Ages were far more rational than we think,"" she says. While recipes involving virgins gathering water at dawn exist in medical texts from the time, they are far less common than people think, Lee points out. Most medieval recipes involve carefully selected ingredients mixed in a very logical and deliberate manner.   The research made a splash when it was published in 2015, but work has not progressed as fast as Lee would like since. The next steps would involve identifying the active ingredients in the leechbook formula for modern medical use. Rumbaugh thinks the formula's efficacy can be improved from 90 percent, bringing it closer to the accepted 99 percent effective standards for an FDA approved antibiotic. 'What we were dealing with in these first experiments was a very crude solution, yet it still did better than vancomycin,"" Rumbaugh says. Identifying the active ingredients and creating an optimal formulation could create a new antibiotic for hospital use that would save lives.   MRSA, which is resistant to most antibiotics, can cause skin and bloodstream infections, pneumonia, and sepsis. It is often acquired in hospitals but has increasingly also been seen outside a hospital setting. In addition to MRSA, years of overuse of antibiotics have created a number of drug-resistant bacteria which doctors are now struggling to treat. At the same time, drug companies have not made major strides in discovering new antibiotics. While some new antibiotics have entered the market, a new class of antibiotics has not been discovered since 1987. This year, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for renewed research into antibiotic-resistant bacteria, listing MRSA as a ""high"" priority. ""We are in such dire need for new antimicrobials that thinking outside the box is exactly what we need to do,"" Rumbaugh says.   The next step is to do clinical trials, Lee tells me. But thus far funding for continuing the research has proven elusive. The research of the interdisciplinary team, made up of microbiologists and medieval scholars, does not fit perfectly into any one category of funding. While they keep applying for new grants, Lee has gotten emails asking if she can provide people with the antibiotic remedy the team made from the leechbook. She sadly can't share the concoction, as ""it is unethical, we say 'don't try this at home,'"" Lee says. Watch More From VICE: Why the Deadly Asbestos Industry is Alive and Well In fact, trying it at home might not be very feasible even with the exact recipe listed in the team's study. The same formula was previously tested in 2005, and failed to yield anything useful. To test it again, Lee and her colleagues sought to replicate the recipe as exactly as possible in modern times. ""Agriculture is very different from the Anglo-Saxon period,"" Lee says. The exact translations of some of the ingredients were also lost to time. The type of onion used in the recipe was unclear, so after many long discussions around alliums, they made several batches, some of which used leeks, while others used onion, both of which, interestingly, worked. Finding wine made in the same methods, with the same grapes as used in medieval times was another challenge. The researchers lucked out and found a vineyard with a charter from the 10th century, whose wine they used for their formula. In an effort to at least somewhat minimize modern pollutants, the researchers used only organic produce for their medieval antibiotic. Not exactly something you can whip up on the weekend.  While the team tries to secure more funding for their leechbook antibiotic, only time and more research will tell if there are other useful drugs hiding in surviving medieval medical texts. One of Lee's former PhD students, Ellen Connolly, is currently working on creating a database from a later medical work, called the ""Lylye of Medicynes,"" from the 15th century. The book contains 360 recipes for medications. By creating the database and examining the relationship between ingredients and the diseases they treat, Connolly hopes to find other antibiotic candidates for testing.   There is every indication that it is possible that more useful recipes are waiting to be discovered. A pharmacist in China, Tu Youyou, won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2015 for her work on a treatment for malaria that used an herbal medication from a Chinese medical work written in 340. Medieval medical practitioners ""were much more meticulous and better practitioners of scientific method than we previously thought,"" Rumbaugh says. ""The formulation loses efficacy if it does not steep for as many days as they specify, or if you remove some of the components. This suggests they were performing empirical tests, recording results and systematically improving their recipes."" It would be a shame to let all of their careful years of research go to waste.

2016-04-13 00:00:00,2016,4.0,13,"CDC: Zika virus causes birth defects, microcephaly"," (CNN)The Zika virus causes microcephaly and other birth defects, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday.  ""This study marks a turning point in the Zika outbreak. It is now clear that the virus causes microcephaly,"" CDC director, Dr. Tom Frieden said.  Previously, the agency said it's likely the virus in pregnant women was the cause of the rare birth defect that results in an underdeveloped brain and that the evidence was mounting. However, they maintained that more research was needed before they could conclusively say it is causal.  There was no smoking gun that lead to this proclamation, according to a special report detailing the evidence published online by the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday.   Based on all of the available evidence, the CDC said two separate sets of criteria to determine a pathogen or environmental exposure causes a birth defect have been met.  ""We started using criteria about a month ago to see which ones had been met and which ones had not been met. We wanted to do this in a systematic and calculated way."" said Dr. Sonja Rasmussen, lead author of the report and editor-in-chief of CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. There was also no alternative explanation to account for the increase in these congenital defects among women who had the Zika virus during pregnancy. Frieden said it's like putting a puzzle together. Last week the World Health Organization said the mosquito-borne virus causes microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. The CDC however, said they are not yet ready to conclude the virus causes Guillain-Barré syndrome. More than 1,000 cases of microcephaly and other fetal malformations believed to be Zika-associated have been reported from six countries, according to the WHO. Rasmussen cautioned that there are still many unanswered questions.  For example, not all babies born to mothers who had Zika virus while pregnant will have babies with birth defects, but the amount of risk is still unknown. Another outstanding question: Does the stage of pregnancy at the time of infection impact the risk or outcome? ""We have studies that are ongoing that we hope will answer these questions as soon as we possibly can,"" she said.  Also unknown is the full range of health problems that can result from the virus. Cases of Zika-related microcephaly and congenital birth defects appear to be more severe than what pediatricians see from non-Zika related microcephaly based on clinical reports.  These include smaller head measurements than expected and a condition called fetal brain disruption sequence in which the virus has a destructive effect on the brain.  Reinforcing the CDC announcement, researchers released a new study looking at brain scans of babies born with suspected Zika related microcephaly in Pernambuco, Brazil, between July and December of last year. They looked at MRI and CT scans of 23 babies and found most of them had severe brain damage they characterized as ""extremely severe"" and an indication of ""poor prognosis of neurological function.""  The study is published in BMJ, the British Medical Journal.  Earlier outbreaks of the Zika virus, in the Pacific Islands, did not result in adverse reports related to pregnancy. More than 50 years ago, the rubella virus was identified as the cause of an epidemic of congenital defects but no other infectious pathogen has been linked this way since then, which is why the CDC said their approach was ""cautious.""  ""This is an unprecedented situation,"" Frieden said. ""Never before in history has there been a situation when a bite from a mosquito can result in such a devastating scenario.""  This does not change any of the recommendations or guidance previously issued by the CDC.  ""We know mosquito bites spread other diseases as well, so it's important for pregnant women, and everyone, to not get bitten by mosquitoes,"" Rasmussen said. That means wearing long pants and long sleeves when outside, using mosquito repellant and removing any standing water from around homes and throughout communities.   CDC teams have been proceeding as if this was the case even without the official conclusion, but now Rasmussen hopes this will not only raise awareness about prevention but also add focus to ongoing Zika research.  Earlier in the day, the White House said President Barack Obama will sign a bill that offers incentives to companies working on Zika treatments and vaccines. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the bill is positive but meager, in reference to the pending request to Congress for $1.9 billion in emergency Zika funds.  ""In some ways, it's akin to passing out umbrellas in the advance of a potential hurricane. An umbrella might come in handy, but it's going to be insufficient to ensure that communities all across the country are protected from a potentially significant impact.""

But as noted by Zatz Not Funny, TiVo seems to be okay with the idea of running ads before those shows begin. The company is testing pre-roll video ads that start playing when customers view a recording. The ad spots are noticeably low-res and worse quality than the DVR’d content that starts playing afterward, according to one TiVo owner who has been served spots for Amazon, Keurig, and Toyota. It sounds like the users can fast-forward through the ads, but doing so is “not that seamless.” There are several potential reasons for TiVo ramping up advertising. Maybe the company plans to offer an ad-supported subscription with lower (or no) monthly fees compared to what regular customers are paying (similar to Amazon’s Kindle devices with ads). No one who has paid for a lifetime subscription or even a monthly plan will be pleased to see pre-roll ads. TiVo also handles DVR functionality for many midsized and international cable providers. Squeezing in ads wherever possible could be something that those companies are pushing for as more of their customers spend increased time streaming shows and movies elsewhere. CNN just ran a story on TiVo’s upcoming 2019 plans. The company is currently splitting into two businesses — one focused on patents, the other on actual products — and it will launch a TiVo Plus service next month. TiVo Plus will be free for TiVo hardware owners, and it will aggregate and recommend content based on your current subscriptions (similar to the Apple TV app). There could also be free ad-supported content a la The Roku Channel. New devices are also coming, with TiVo aiming to release a $50 dongle that runs Android TV to expand upon its base of DVR customers.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875613/tivo-ad-tests-pre-roll-dvr-recordings,Tech,The Verge,technology,312
2017-04-20 00:00:00,2017,4.0,20,Germany's Lilium says successfully tests 'flying taxi' prototype,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A Bavarian start-up is developing a five-seat “flying taxi” after successful test flights over Germany of a smaller version of the electric jet, the company said on Thursday. Munich-based Lilium, backed by investors who include Skype co-founder Niklas Zennstrom, said the planned five-seater jet, which will be capable of vertical take-off and landing, could be used for urban air taxi and ride-sharing services. In flight tests, a two-seat prototype executed manoeuvres that included a mid-air transition from hover mode - like a drone - to wing-borne flight - like a conventional aircraft, Lilium said. Potential competitors to Lilium Jet include much bigger players such as Airbus, the maker of commercial airliners and helicopters that aims to test a prototype self-piloted, single-seat “flying car” later in 2017. Slovakian firm AeroMobil said at a car show in Monaco on Thursday it would start taking pre-orders for a hybrid flying car that can drive on roads. It said it planned production from 2020. But makers of “flying cars” still face hurdles, including convincing regulators and the public that their products can be used safely. Governments are still grappling with regulations for drones and driverless cars. Lilium said its jet, with a range of 300 km (190 miles) and cruising speed of 300 km per hour, is the only electric aircraft capable of both vertical take-off and jet-powered flight. “We have solved some of the toughest engineering challenges in aviation to get to this point,” Lilium Co-founder and Chief Executive Daniel Wiegand said in a statement. The jet, whose power consumption per km is comparable to an electric car, could offer passenger flights at prices comparable to normal taxis but with speeds five times faster, Lilium said. Lilium, founded in 2014 by four graduates from the Technical University of Munich, is unusual on the German start-up scene, which is dominated by ecommerce firms largely based in Berlin and self-financed, engineering firms dotted around the country. It raised $11.4 million (10.6 million euros) in 2016 from Zennstrom-led venture firm Atomico Partners and e42, the investment arm of entrepreneur Frank Thelen, a juror on the German of investment reality TV show “Lion’s Den”. Other potential rivals include crowd-funded eVolo, a firm based near Mannheim that has said it expects to receive special regulatory approval for its two-seat “multicopter” with 18 rotors to be used as flying taxis in pilot projects by 2018. Terrafugia, based outside the U.S. city of Boston and founded a decade ago by MIT graduates, aims to build a mass-market flying car, while U.S.-Israeli firm Joby Aviation has said it is working on a four-seater drone. Google, Tesla and Uber [UBER.UL] have also reportedly shown interest in the new technology.

2018-11-12 23:24:00,2018,11.0,12,Judges Are Forcing People to Get Mental Health Treatment But We Still Don't Know if It Works,"When mental illness hijacks Margaret Rodgers’ mind, she acts out. Rodgers, 35, lives with depression and bipolar disorder. When left unchecked, the conditions drive the Alabama woman to excessive spending, crying, and mania.  Last autumn, Rodgers felt her mind unraveling. Living in Birmingham, she was uninsured, unable to afford treatment and in the throes of a divorce. Although Rodgers traveled south to her brother’s house in Foley, Alabama, for respite, she couldn’t escape thoughts of suicide, which one day led her to his gun.  “I hit bottom,” she recalls. But she didn’t pull the trigger. Rodgers told her brother about the close call. News of the incident reached her mother, who then alerted authorities to Rodgers’ near attempt.  Within days, Rodgers was handcuffed and hauled in front of a judge who ordered her to undergo mental health treatment—but not a hospital commitment. Instead, the judge mandated six months of care that included weekly therapy sessions and medication, all while Rodgers continued living with her family.  Rodgers entered assisted outpatient treatment (AOT), also known as involuntary outpatient commitment.  Since its inception, the court-ordered intervention has generated controversy. Proponents say it secures the comprehensive care that people with severe mental illnesses might not recognize they need. Yet other health experts question the effectiveness of the intervention and suggest it represents a quick fix in a mental health system that is not adequately serving patients.  “It’s a stopgap measure that works in the short term,” says Annette Hanson, director of the University of Maryland Forensic Psychiatry Fellowship who co-authored a book on the intervention. “But it’s not a good long-term solution because you still have lots of people who need voluntary care who can’t get it.” Assisted outpatient treatment requires a judge’s order. While the eligibility requirements and compliance standards vary by state, participants typically have a history of arrests and multiple hospitalizations. They stay in their communities while undergoing treatment. Watch More From VICE News: The American Psychiatric Association (APA) endorsed its use in 2015, saying assisted outpatient treatment has generally shown positive outcomes under certain circumstances. To effectively treat patients, the position paper said, the APA recommends that the intervention be well-planned, “linked to intensive outpatient services,” and last for at least 180 days, or six months.  A key advantage to assisted outpatient treatment, supporters say, is that it provides care for people who might not recognize the severity of their illness. A court’s involvement also increases the likelihood of a participant complying with the program, a phenomenon called the “black robe effect,” they add.  ""That is really what we've found to be the secret sauce” for success, says John Snook, executive director of the nonprofit Treatment Advocacy Center.  But many areas do not have the necessary community mental health services to provide assisted outpatient treatment effectively, says Ira Burnim, legal director for the Judge David L. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.  He also says the law already provides options for hospital treatment for people considered a danger to themselves or others. Any person recommended for assisted outpatient treatment for these reasons should be in a hospital receiving intensive inpatient care, Burnim says, not in the community.  ""You know, when people don't take their medication,” he says, “that’s a clinical problem, not a legal problem.”  Assisted outpatient treatment gained popularity after Andrew Goldstein, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia but wasn’t taking his medication, pushed Kendra Webdale in front of an oncoming train in New York City in 1999, killing her. Webdale’s family fought for a change in the law after learning that Goldstein had repeatedly refused treatment while living on his own.  Today, 47 states and the District of Columbia have versions of Kendra’s Law allowing localities to set up assisted outpatient treatment, according to the Treatment Advocacy Center, a nonprofit group that strongly supports assisted outpatient treatment.  Yet, there is no tally of the number of programs or the number of people involuntarily placed in one, said David DeVoursney, chief for the Community Support Programs Branch at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).  There is also little research on its effectiveness. Two randomized studies produced contradictory results about the intervention’s effect on hospitalization rates and the number of arrests afterward. However, other analyses have shown improved outcomes, particularly among participants in New York.  Despite the ambiguity, Congress created grants in 2014 that made up to $60 million available over four years to new assisted outpatient treatment programs. Additionally, the 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016 to accelerate drug development, allowed some Department of Justice funding for the intervention.  Experts acknowledge that the scarcity of mental health providers and treatment options causes many patients to go without care. Instead of doctors’ offices, many people with mental illnesses end up in jail—an estimated 2 million every year, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness.  ""What we say very often is basically we have a system that allows people to have heart attacks over and over again,” Snook said. “And then once they have that heart attack, we take them to jail. And then we wonder why the system isn't working."" One recipient of federal funding for assisted outpatient treatment is AltaPointe Health Systems Inc., a community health center that provides services to residents—including Rodgers—in two Alabama counties. The program has received nearly $1.1 million in federal funds, according to Cindy Gipson, assistant director of intensive services. She said the center applied for the federal grant to reduce the number of hospitalizations among residents living with severe mental illnesses. “We were having a lot of people who would go to the hospital, then be discharged,” she says. “And they’d do well for a couple of weeks—maybe even a month. Then, they’d go right back in.” The program, which began in 2017, has served 71 patients, Gipson says. On average, patients stay about 150 days. And roughly 60 percent of referrals come from family members, she said. The majority of people entering have a history of multiple hospitalizations and arrests.  Rodgers says she had never been in handcuffs before the day the Alabama police officer came to her brother’s home and awakened her around 7 AM. The sheriff gave her five minutes to change and brush her teeth. He then cuffed her wrists, placed her in the back of his car and drove her straight to court. After she was asked a few questions about how she was doing, Rodgers says, she sat down in front of a judge and learned about assisted outpatient treatment for the first time. Despite how she entered care, Rodgers says the mandated treatment has brought her stability. She sees a therapist once a week, and once a month a nurse at the community health center administers a shot of the antipsychotic drug Abilify. She now is working part-time cleaning condos and lives with her mother. She said she has learned strategies to not dwell on the past.  After her first six months of treatment, Rodgers and her care team decided to continue care through the rest of the year. She plans to return to Birmingham and find a better job after completing the program.  Right now, she says, “staying positive is the main thing I want.”  Kaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

2018-09-11 17:27:00,2018,9.0,11,Doctor Who Treated Celebrities Disciplined for Controversial Menopause Therapy,"A Santa Monica doctor who touted a controversial menopause therapy and received testimonials for her work from such celebrity patients as model Cindy Crawford and actress-author Suzanne Somers has been disciplined by California’s medical board for gross negligence. In a settlement approved late last month, the Medical Board of California put Dr. Prudence Hall on probation for four years, faulting her for being “unaware” of potential risks posed by the plant-based hormones — including cancer — and failing to monitor her patients properly. Hall used numerous hormones to treat two women, according to the board, missing an aggressive uterine cancer in one patient and treating the other based on an “incorrect diagnosis in a manner such that [Hall] stood to gain financially.” “My jaw was on the floor. This is just egregious,” said Dr. Jen Gunter, a San Francisco Bay Area OB-GYN who reviewed the medical board’s report. “You hear about all these self-described functional medicine doctors providing these treatments. Never in my wildest dreams did I think it would be in this ballpark.” Hall’s publicist, Bette Light, said in a statement that “Dr. Hall continues to devote her career and life to helping patients achieve optimal health and wellness.” “She utilizes advances in modern medicine plus proven natural therapies. Safely incorporating results of the latest medical research has allowed her to achieve exceptional results for her patients.” The statement added that Hall “joins respected physicians worldwide who are also using” this type of hormone therapy. The hormone therapies prescribed by Hall are supposedly customized to individual patients’ needs and are generally not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. They are known as “bioidentical” because their molecular structure is the same as the natural hormones found in a woman’s body, including estrogen and progesterone. Hall has claimed to have treated more than 40,000 patients with them over 30 years. Under the terms of her settlement with the board, she is no longer allowed to promote herself as a specialist in hormone therapy, an OB-GYN or an endocrinologist, and she must submit her medical practice to oversight by an outside physician who will report to the board. She is allowed to continue treating women for menopause management and other health issues. Her case stands as a possible warning to many other physicians and providers who have embraced such unproven hormone treatments. Popularized by testimonials from celebrity women, these made-to-order hormones are used by up to 2.5 million women in the United States, according to one study. Crawford and Somer’s representatives told PEOPLE they chose not to comment at this time. Hall has been hailed by supporters as a “pioneer” in this type of personalized bioidentical hormone therapy, appearing on national television and infomercials and promoting such treatments as a virtual fountain of youth. In her appearances, Hall offers an appealing message to women entering their 50s and 60s who are looking for “natural” relief from hot flashes, night sweats, loss of libido, aging skin or other concerns. The hormone treatments she provides are “like water to a plant,” Hall told Somers on an episode of Somers’ television program, “The Suzanne Show.” “How could water be bad for a plant? … Hormones do not cause cancer.” Dr. David Gorski, a surgical oncologist, professor of surgery at Wayne State University School of Medicine and a longtime critic of unproven alternative medicine, rejected Hall’s analogy. “I’m not a gardener by any stretch of the imagination,” he said, “but even I know that too much water can kill a plant.” Many other clinicians and researchers say there’s no evidence to back up the claims by Hall and other doctors that these customized treatments are more effective or safer or that they act any differently in the body than FDA-approved hormone replacement therapies. Some bioidentical hormones, unlike the ones primarily used by Hall, are FDA-approved. They are manufactured in pharmaceutical plants using standard formulas and have been shown to relieve menopausal symptoms — though they have not been tested in large, long-term trials — according to a report in Harvard Women’s Health Watch. The customized therapies used by Hall and other doctors are mixed in compounding pharmacies and generally are not tested for safety and efficacy, according to Harvard Women’s Health Watch and other reports. Compounded bioidenticals are big business. In 2013, U.S. sales of these products were estimated in one study at $845 million, compared with a $3.7 billion market for traditional, FDA-approved hormone replacement medications. “There’s a definite concern that for some women they may be dangerous,” said Dr. Janet Pregler, director of the Iris Cantor-UCLA Women’s Health Center. “Often these [hormones] are presented as risk-free, when we as physicians know that nothing you put in your body is risk-free.” Women flocked to bioidentical hormone treatment after the Women’s Health Initiative, a massive federally funded study on a widely used hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women, was halted prematurely in 2002 over concerns about an elevated risk of breast cancer, heart disease and stroke. Hall, according to medical board investigators, put a patient with a family history of uterine cancer on a regimen of bioidentical hormones after the woman complained of “zero libido” and menstrual migraines. She also prescribed iodine and two adrenal hormone supplements. The patient started to bleed — a potential warning sign of uterine cancer — but Hall prescribed her more hormones, according to the medical board. Ultimately, the patient developed a cancerous mass in her uterus — but board investigators alleged that Hall failed to detect it, after performing ultrasounds on the patient that she was not certified to analyze. She charged the patient $7,000 over three years for the treatment, according to the board. In the two cases for which she was disciplined — which occurred between 2011 and 2015 — the medical board found that Hall treated women who were not yet in menopause but whom she incorrectly diagnosed as being in perimenopause. Those are the years immediately before menopause that can create uncomfortable symptoms such as hot flashes and low libido. Their lab tests showed hormone values within normal limits, the board said. The second patient had numerous other conditions including diabetes and a history of psychiatric disorders, according to the board. The board said Hall diagnosed the patient with hypothyroidism when no clinical evidence supported such a diagnosis — and that later aberrations that surfaced in lab testing had actually been caused by the physician’s treatment. Hall presented herself to patients as a specialist in “hormone balance,” or endocrinology,” but does not have any post-medical school training by an accredited fellowship in either medical or reproductive endocrinology, according to the board. It’s not the first time California’s medical board has disciplined a doctor for prescribing such bioidentical hormones. In 2009, the board put Dr. Michael Platt of Rancho Mirage on five years’ probation after charging him with negligence and incompetence for his treatments of several patients. The doctor, author of “The Miracle of Bio-identical Hormones,” later was forced to surrender his license. Experts say such doctors take advantage of patients’ vulnerability as they age. “We all fear getting older and loss of sexuality, and the way society makes women feel, women are more vulnerable to it, for sure,” said Gunter, the Bay Area OB-GYN. “I don’t blame the patients for going to the doctor and putting trust in them. I blame the doctors for saying this can somehow help them.” This story was produced by Kaiser Health News (KHN), which publishes California Healthline, an editorially independent service of the California Health Care Foundation.

2017-07-26 22:53:00,2017,7.0,26,Hacker Says He Broke Through Samsung's Secure Smartphone Platform," Beyond your normal Apple and Android devices exists a lively trade of specialized, security-focused smartphones. From the BlackPhone to custom BlackBerrys, these companies often promise more robust message communications and hardened devices. That doesn't mean these phones are immune to hackers, however. In a presentation this week at Black Hat, one researcher will present how he thwarted the extra security mechanisms of Samsung's security-focused mobile platform KNOX. Although the vulnerabilities have already been fixed, the news still acts as a reminder that issues will likely exist in all pieces of software, even those designed specifically to be harder for hackers to penetrate. Di Shen, a senior security researcher from research group Keen Lab, told Motherboard he started working on KNOX after discovering vulnerabilities that affected loads of Android devices, including Google Nexus, Huawei, and HTC phones back in 2016. The exploit also worked on a Samsung Galaxy S6, but curiously failed on the S7 Edge version. ""So I want to know why, and I believe there are some new exclusive kernel mitigations from Samsung KNOX. That is why I start to look at KNOX,"" he told Motherboard in a text message. KNOX is a security platform available on Galaxy devices. It detects any tampering and provides more assurance that data is secure, according to Samsung's website. KNOX products are certified by 29 governments, and are also marketed towards business and enterprise customers, the website adds. In short, Shen's exploit is a jailbreak, which removed the normal restrictions over installing new software or features. All a user needed to do was to download Shen's app, called KingRoot. Shen said Samsung contacted him and asked for some technical details about the exploit, and asked whether the vulnerabilities have been fixed. Shen says Google fixed the issues in December.

Britain has so far confirmed 273 cases of the virus and three deaths. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is chairing a meeting of the government’s emergency committee on Monday to discuss possible measures to try to delay the spread.

It will then aim to identify and respond to disinformation where necessary. “Defending the country from misinformation and digital interference is a top priority,” Digital and Culture Minister Oliver Dowden said in a statement. “This work includes regular engagement with the social media companies, which are well placed to monitor interference and limit the spread of disinformation, and will make sure we are on the front foot to act if required.” (Reporting by Kylie MacLellan; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-britain-disinformatio/britain-sets-up-team-to-tackle-coronavirus-disinformation-idUSL8N2B10WC,Healthcare,Reuters,health,181

2018-12-10 00:00:00,2018,12.0,10,How to check your medical records for dangerous errors,"When Liz Tidyman's elderly parents moved across the country to be closer to their children and grandchildren years ago, they carried their medical records with them in a couple of brown cardboard folders tied with string. Two days after their arrival, Tidyman's father fell, which hadn't happened before, and went to a hospital for an evaluation. In the waiting room, Tidyman opened the folder. ""Very soon I saw that there were pages and pages of notes that referred to a different person with the same name -- a person whose medical conditions were much more complicated and numerous than my father's,"" she said. Tidyman pulled out sheets with mistaken information and made a mental note to always check records in the future. ""That was a wake-up call,"" she said. Older adults have cause to be careful about what's in their medical records. Although definitive data aren't available, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology estimates that nearly 1 in 10 people who access records online end up requesting that they be corrected for a variety of reasons. In the worst-case scenario, an incorrect diagnosis, scan or lab result may have been inserted into a record, raising the possibility of inappropriate medical evaluation or treatment. This, too, is something that Tidyman's father encountered soon after moving from Massachusetts to Washington. (Her parents have since passed away.) When both his new primary care physician and cardiologist asked about kidney cancer -- a condition he didn't have -- Tidyman reviewed materials from her father's emergency room visit. There, she saw that ""renal cell carcinoma"" (kidney cancer) was listed instead of ""basal cell carcinoma"" (skin cancer) -- an illness her father had mentioned while describing his medical history. ""It was a transcription error; something we clearly had to fix,"" Tidyman said. Omissions from medical records -- allergies that aren't noted, lab results that aren't recorded, medications that aren't listed -- can be equally devastating.  Susan Sheridan discovered this nearly 20 years ago after her husband, Pat, had surgery to remove a mass in his neck. A hospital pathology report identified synovial cell sarcoma, a type of cancer, but somehow the report didn't reach his neurosurgeon. Instead, the surgeon reassured the couple that the tumor was benign. Six months later, when Pat returned to the hospital in distress, this error of omission was discovered. By then, Pat's untreated cancer had metastasized to his spinal canal. He died 2½ years later. ""I tell people, 'Collect all your medical records, no matter what' so you can ask all kinds of questions and be on the alert for errors,"" said Sheridan, director of patient engagement with the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine. In less dire scenarios, a patient's name, address, phone number or personal contacts may be incorrect, making it difficult to reach someone in the event of an emergency or causing a bill to be sent to the wrong location. Or, your family history may not be conveyed accurately. Or, you may not have received a service recorded in your record -- for instance, a stress test -- and want to contest the bill. Dave deBronkart, a 68-year-old cancer survivor and patient activist, recounts mistakes he and his family have experienced. Once, he checked a radiology report through a Boston hospital's patient portal. It had his name on it but identified him as a 53-year-old woman. In another instance, the records that accompanied deBronkart's mother to a rehabilitation center after a hip replacement incorrectly identified her as having an underactive thyroid when in fact she had an overactive thyroid. DeBronkart's sisters, who asked to look at their mother's chart, discovered the mistake and had it fixed on the spot, so she wouldn't get potentially harmful medications. ""It's important for people to realize how easy it is for mistakes to get into the system and for nobody to know it. And that can cause downstream harm,"" deBronkart said. The law that guarantees your right to review your medical record, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, offers some recourse: If you think you've discovered an error in your medical record, you have the right to ask for a correction. (For more information about how to obtain your record, see my earlier column here.) Start by asking your doctor or hospital if they have a form (either a paper or electronic version) you should use to submit a suggested change. A simple error such as a wrong phone number can be corrected by drawing a thin line through the material and writing a suggested change in the margins or making an electronic note. A more complicated error such as incorrect description of your symptoms or a diagnosis that you're contesting may require a brief statement from you explaining what material in the record is wrong, why and how it should be altered. Physicians and hospitals are required to respond in writing within 60 days, with the possibility of a 30-day extension. (Some states set shorter deadlines.) But medical providers are not obligated to accept your request. If you receive a rejection, you have the right to add another statement contesting this decision to your medical record. You can also file a complaint with the government office that oversees HIPAA or a state agency that licenses physicians. Devin O'Brien, senior counsel with The Doctors Company, the largest physician-owned medical malpractice firm in the U.S., notes that rejections can be warranted when facts or medical judgments are in question. An example might be a patient who wants a doctor's notes about potentially excessive opioid use eliminated from the record. ""The patient may say I don't have a problem, I don't know what you're talking about, but the physician may think the patient has an issue,"" O'Brien said. Another example might be a patient who wants a diagnosis eliminated from a medical record, because it might compromise her ability to get insurance coverage. That wouldn't be an acceptable reason for making a change, experts said.

2018-06-19 21:35:00,2018,6.0,19,Deepfakes Were Created As a Way to Own Women's Bodies—We Can't Forget That,"  This story appears in VICE magazine and Broadly's 2018 Privacy and Perception Photo Issue. Click HERE to subscribe to VICE magazine. When we first found Reddit user “Deepfakes”—a play on deep machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, and fake photos—he was in a celebrity doppelgänger porn forum quietly going about his hobby: creating the videos that would eventually take on his name and become a symbol of Truth’s deterioration. There he was, out in the virtual wide open, diligently cranking out fictional footage of women through a machine-learning meat grinder and posting them to public porn forums. And holy shit did they look believable. For the blissfully uninitiated, deepfakes are AI-generated videos in which a person’s face is attached to someone else’s body. They began as Frankenporn made from mash-ups of celebrity faces and porn performer bodies, creating pretty realistic videos of people having sex that never happened. Deepfakes first posted his creations to Reddit toward the end of 2017, and by December, my editors at Motherboard, VICE’s science and tech outlet, and I tracked him down and published the first in-depth article on the phenomenon. Come mid January 2018, people in deepfakes-focused subreddits had made a user-friendly application called FakeApp for running the algorithm the job required. Soon, it seemed like every fake porn enthusiast was making their own AI-generated sex tapes with varying success.

2016-02-23 00:00:00,2016,2.0,23,Female genital 'nicks' should be legal: gynecologists,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Countries that have banned female genital mutilation (FGM) should allow less invasive practices such as small surgical nicks to girls’ genitalia as a compromise, two American gynecologists said on Monday. But campaigners against FGM strongly criticized the proposal, saying it would undermine global efforts to eradicate the internationally condemned ritual. At least 200 million girls and women have been subjected to FGM in over 30 countries, according to U.N. estimates. The ancient practice usually involves the partial or total removal of a girl’s external genitalia. In some cases the vaginal opening is also sewn up. But some communities practice less invasive rituals such as pricking or nicking the clitoris. The U.S. gynecologists, writing in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that permitting more minimal procedures could allow families to uphold cultural and religious traditions while protecting girls from more dangerous forms of cutting. Communities which support FGM often consider it a prerequisite for marriage. Many also see it as a religious obligation although it is not mentioned in the Koran or Bible. But FGM can cause a host of physical and psychological problems. Gynecologists Kavita Shah Arora and Allan Jacobs said procedures that slightly changed the look of a girl’s genitalia without damaging them were comparable to male circumcision or cosmetic procedures in Western countries like labiaplasty. Laws against mild modifications were “culturally insensitive and supremacist and discriminatory towards women”, they wrote in the specialist journal, which is published by the British Medical Journal. FGM is practiced in a swathe of African countries, pockets of Asia and the Middle East, as well as by diaspora communities living in the West. The gynecologists suggested that global attempts to stamp out FGM with legislation had failed and may by driving the practice underground. “We are not arguing that any procedure on the female genitalia is desirable,” they said. “Rather, we only argue that certain procedures ought to be tolerated by liberal societies.” They said the term “female genital mutilation” should be replaced with the less emotive “female genital alteration” (FGA) to avoid “demonizing important cultural practices”. But experts on medical ethics, commenting on the proposal, said procedures to modify girls’ genitals could not be compared to male circumcision because they are designed to control women and curb their sexual desire. They also predicted that legalizing more minimal procedures would generate a litany of legal, regulatory and medical problems. Global campaigners against FGM said doctors should challenge harmful social norms, not condone them. “Any form of FGM is a violation of a child’s rights,” said Adwoa Kwateng-Kluvitse, head of global advocacy at the charity FORWARD which campaigns against FGM in Africa and Europe. “Why would you put a little girl through that? There should be no medicalization of FGM. They (the gynecologists) are completely behind the times. “This is very different to male circumcision. With male circumcision there is no intention to attenuate sexual desire, control sexuality or enforce chastity.” Rights group Equality Now said the “medicalization” of FGM remained one of the biggest threats to its elimination. It said FGM prevalence rates had fallen significantly in many countries and that properly implemented laws had been very effective in countries like Kenya.

2016-05-24 00:00:00,2016,5.0,24,"Toyota, Uber latest to join forces in ride-hailing rush","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) said on Tuesday it would invest in on-demand ride-hailing company Uber, the latest in a wave of high-profile moves by automakers to embrace their potential upstart rivals as partners, customers and sources of valuable data. Toyota and Uber will create new leasing options in which Uber drivers can lease vehicles with flexible terms from Toyota Financial Services and cover their payments through their Uber earnings, the companies said in a joint statement. Toyota and Uber did not disclose the size of the investment, but the alliance will go beyond just vehicle sales. The companies said they would be “sharing knowledge and accelerating their respective research efforts.” Both Toyota and Uber are researching self-driving cars and other technology that connects travelers to different modes of transportation. Traditional automakers are racing to ally with ride-sharing partners to avoid becoming bystanders if a significant number of consumers around the world choose to forego vehicle ownership and buy transportation by the mile or the minute. Technology companies such as Apple (AAPL.O), Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O) and startups such as Uber have attracted significant investments, and in Uber’s case, a valuation estimated to be higher than General Motors Co’s (GM.N), by positioning themselves as a threat to the vehicle market status quo. Moreover, both carmakers and mobility upstarts are investing in autonomous vehicle technology which they believe will power fleets of self-driving cars in future. Uber is investing in autonomous technology, including mapping, while Toyota has been opening research labs in the United States, spending $1 billion through 2020 in research and develop for artificial intelligence and robotics to help develop self-driving cars. Earlier on Tuesday, German automaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) announced a $300 million investment in Gett, a smaller ride-sharing company. Earlier this year, GM invested $500 million in Lyft, Uber’s main U.S. rival, to develop an on-demand network of self-driving cars. GM executives have said Lyft could serve as a platform to launch the automaker’s Chevy Bolt, an electric car slated to hit the market late this year. Uber’s alliance with Toyota also follows hard on the heels of Apple’s $1 billion investment in Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing, which was seen as a political move by the technology giant to cement its presence in the crucial Chinese market. Apple is also believed to be studying the development of a car. Ford Motor Co (F.N) is looking at partnerships to expand beyond manufacturing and selling cars, with Chairman Bill Ford saying on Monday that “you’ll hear more from us” as the year progresses. On Tuesday, startup NuTonomy, backed by Bill Ford’s venture capital arm Fontinalis Partners, raised $16 million in extra funding to help develop self-driving taxis in Singapore. Toyota is making the Uber investment through its unit Toyota Financial Services Corporation and Mirai Creation Investment Limited Partnership.

2017-10-05 12:00:00,2017,10.0,5,Everything You Need to Know About Zika,"Zika has been in the news a lot over the past few years—during the recent outbreak of 2015-2016, the virus infected thousands of people in 60 countries throughout the Americas. You've probably heard about its most devastating effect: That the children of infected pregnant women are more likely to be born with microcephaly, a condition that causes the brain to develop abnormally. As the disease spread, researchers hustled to learn more about it. There are still questions, but they've found a lot of answers, too. Why did I only hear about Zika a few years ago? Is it new? Nope. Zika was first discovered in 1947 in Uganda. In the decades since, there have been a few outbreaks, mostly in Africa. Between 2007 and 2014, however it spread to Asia, causing outbreaks on a some islands in the Pacific. Its genes indicate that it is most similar to the version that was circulating around the south Pacific, so scientists are pretty sure that's where it came from, though there are a few theories about how exactly it came to South America (one of them involves a canoeing competition). How do you get zika?The most common way to get Zika is through bite of an infected female mosquito from the Aedes family. The mosquito—which is common as far south as Argentina and as far north as the southern US—gets the virus into its system after feeding on the blood of an infected person. The virus then enters its saliva, which infects the new victim when he or she is bitten. There's also evidence that Zika can be transmitted sexually, even when people don't have symptoms. Because Zika hangs out in bodily fluids like blood and vaginal secretions (and stays the longest in semen), it can be passed through vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Scientists don't know how commonly this happens, or how long the virus is transmissible from an infected person. Zika can also be passed from a pregnant mother to her child. What does it do to you? Four times out of five, it does nothing to adults—no symptoms. For those who do experience symptoms, they're not unlike the flu, or dengue—fever, rash, headache, pain in the joints and muscles. They usually clear up within a week or so. Some people develop a rare condition called Guillain-Barré syndrome, in which the immune system attacks the body's nerve cells, causing muscle pain and paralysis. A handful of Zika patients have died, but usually from concurrent illnesses affecting the immune system (such as Guillain-Barré syndrome). For babies, the effect can be much more profound and long-lasting—the some 2,300 babies born with microcephaly from this outbreak will be affected for their whole lives. That number may even rise, as there have been some cases of babies born to Zika-infected mothers who initially didn't have microcephaly, but developed it as infants just a few months old. How do you get rid of zika? Because it's a virus, you kind of just have to let Zika run its course. People who experience symptoms should see them clear up in about a week. But because the virus can stay in bodily fluids a lot longer, and because of its effect on fetuses, the CDC recommends that men infected with Zika wait six months after exposure before they start trying to have a kid, and women should wait eight weeks before trying to conceive. There is an upside in all this: Once you have it, you're immune to future infection. Since there's no treatment, prevention is the name of the game when it comes to Zika. If you're having sex with someone who has Zika, or has had Zika, or recently traveled to an area where Zika-carrying mosquitoes live, use protection. If you are traveling to a region where there's Zika, do your best to prevent mosquito bites by wearing long sleeves and insect repellant. Pregnant women, or women planning to become pregnant soon, should not travel to areas affected by Zika. Last November, the World Health Organization declared the end of the Zika outbreak. But that doesn't mean the disease is no longer a threat; these prevention tactics are still useful, especially for pregnant women. For some, including the parents of children who developed microcephaly as a result of the virus, the impact of the outbreak will last a lifetime.

2019-07-23 00:00:00,2019,7.0,23,"Beaches across America showed unsafe levels of pollution last year, a study finds"," (CNN)Before you head to the beach this summer, you might want to double-check the water conditions. Last year, nearly 60% of 4,523 beaches tested across the United States demonstrated unsafe water pollution levels on at least one day, according to a report released Tuesday by the nonprofits Environment America Research & Policy Center and Frontier Group. These 2,585 beaches had bacteria levels that exceeded the US Environmental Protection Agency's ""Beach Action Value"" threshold, which it recommends states use to provide an early alert to beachgoers who may be particularly sensitive to contaminants.  On the higher end of the scale in the new report, Inner Cabrillo Beach in Los Angeles County had 85 potentially unsafe days out of 175 days sampled. By contrast, Bethany Beach in Delaware's Sussex County tested potentially unsafe on one of 33 sampled days. The report compiled data from sampling conducted by local, state and federal agencies submitted to the National Water Quality Monitoring Council's Water Quality Portal. It warned that sewage and fecal contamination of swimming areas pose a public health threat. Humans who come into contact with it can develop gastrointestinal illness, respiratory disease, infections and skin rashes, the report said. Sources of pollution at beaches include urban runoff, sewage overflow and failing septic systems, and concentrated livestock manure, according to the report. The number of reported recreational water illnesses has steadily increased over the past few decades, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. About 90 million illnesses occur from water recreation events annually, according to a 2018 study published in the journal Environmental Health. ""Swimming at the beach is a prime summertime joy for millions of Americans, but clearly we have more work to do to make sure water at all our beaches is safe,"" John Rumpler, director of Environment America's Clean Water Program, said in a news release. ""We must invest in water infrastructure that prevents pollution to ensure that America's waterways are safe for swimming."" Staying safe at the beach ""When it gets hot, it gets easy for bacteria to grow in the ocean,"" said Dr. Alison Huffstetler, a physician at the Georgetown University School of Medicine. However, most bacteria dissipate quickly, she said. ""There has to be a lot of contamination to have a real impact on people going to the beach,"" she said. ""There's absolutely bacteria in the water every time you get in."" Huffstetler recommends taking general precautions like washing hands and feet after getting out of the water and avoiding swallowing ocean water.  The EPA also suggests that beachgoers avoid swimming at beaches where they can see discharge pipes or at urban beaches after a heavy rainfall. This story has been updated to reflect that the Environment America Research & Policy Center and Frontier Group changed the number of beaches with high bacteria levels in the report.",https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/23/health/us-beaches-pollution-study-trnd/index.html,health,CNN,health,472
2017-05-02 12:00:00,2017,5.0,2,What It's Like to Come Out as a Gay Football Player," American football and homosexuality haven't historically gone hand in hand. In my grade school, a football-based game called ""Smear the Queer"" was popular among boys on the playground. As a former player who lived in a conservative religious town, my ignorance back during my playing days was an accurate reflection of the overall perception of gay males athletes.  I was consumed by the hyper-masculinity that still pervades football, as were other young male athletes. ""American football is a metaphor for war and American world dominance,"" Sara Crawley, associate professor of sociology, said in her exploration of masculinity in football. She asserted that the heteronormative sport is deeply intertwined with sexuality, and the iconic status of male athlete ""heroes"" implies that they take whatever they want—which, Crawley specified, are ""beautiful female bodies."" So what happens when a football player doesn't fit this caveman image?  In my mind then (ten years ago), gay men didn't make sense in my favorite sport because of what Crawley observed: They didn't fit into what I perceived as the culture of being a tough-minded competitor. At that point, not one professional football player had ever come out. There were no conversations being had about homosexuality in sports.   In the last few years, thankfully, things have changed—but not by much. Former defensive lineman Michael Sam became the first openly gay college football player when he came out to his teammates at the University of Missouri in August 2013. Nine months later, he became the first openly gay player to be drafted into the National Football League, and then played in the CFL before retiring due to mental health concerns in 2015. Since then, a few other players have put their sexual identity into the spotlight.  For Sam and those who followed, their actions shifted the conversation, but how much have we progressed? Just this past week, the media have been speculating that New England Patriots' Aaron Hernandez's sexuality could have been a motive in his decision to murder his friend, Odin Lloyd. Hernandez, who killed himself in jail on April 19th, was at the center of what the New Yorker is calling ""worrisome reporting"" that included jokes about him possibly having relationships with men.  Darrion McAlister is an offensive lineman on the Marian University football team who came out in February after battling depression and anxiety for years. ""Before I came out, I was in really bad depressive stages a few times a month,"" McAlister says. ""I would constantly think about how my family, teammates and coaches would react. I would sleep for days at a time. I would be at work, crying for thirty minutes straight. It definitely affected how guarded I was when I played and it still affects me now. Some guys will question my toughness and sometimes I have to be more masculine just so they don't see me differently.""  Imagine coming out to 80 young men and/or coaches whose stance on homosexuality you're unsure of. The United States already has a reputation for having the worst sports-related homophobia. ""Young athletes tend to use sports to understand themselves better,"" says Carlton Green, a staff psychologist at University of Maryland, where he's counseled many athletes. ""So when we teach these young boys that being a man is about being aggressive, violent and dominating other people, we are denying them certain aspects of their own humanity. Sometimes when you don't get to experience all of who you really are, that can lead to this level of social incompleteness and even depression. Whether it's their coaches, teammates, the institution or their own families, if these gay athletes don't feel these relationships will survive this disclosure of their identity, then they likely will not come out and will possibly have a mental health crisis."" A huge responsibility falls on teammates and coaches especially, it seems, and whether they channel their energy in a way that creates a comfortable enough environment for a man to come out. Why would you want to lose out on a great player and teammate just because of their sexual preference? Michael Sam was a unanimous college All-American, conference player of the year and was known to be a great teammate on and off the field, but he left the sport. I can't help but wonder how his teammates did or didn't support him.  ""These gay athletes tend to struggle with being able to relate with their heterosexual teammates on various levels,"" Green says. ""When you aren't able to relate to your teammates, especially when you are trying to come out, that stress immediately can turn into anxiety or depression. As that stress manifests itself, it stops these young gay men from being who they are and that anxiety and depression will continue to build.""  ""Before I came out, I felt like I had society coming down on me and I had to conform to being a heterosexual male, but the hyper-masculinity of the sport never really affected me, honestly,"" says Kyle Kurdziolek, a starting linebacker at the University of St. Francis football team in Illinois. ""I don't expect a bunch of men to watch what they say just because of one guy. I understand the demographics of the room, I have a great sense of humor and I know I can rely on them.""  He has a point. Changing the entire psychosocial aspect of the sport is not exactly the easiest option. Asking a bunch of college football players to suddenly be LGBTQ-friendly—refraining from using the word ""fag"" for one—on and off the field is an uphill battle. But it's a battle that both McAlister and Kurdziolek at least seems to be winning.  ""I don't go through those depressive stages anymore, since coming out,"" McAlister says. ""I definitely see myself more of an advocate for gay rights then I was before....I am definitely more vocal and confident about calling out teammates on their insensitivity to certain things.""

2016-02-16 13:00:00,2016,2.0,16,"The Life of Pablo, the Death of Streaming Music as We Know it","The release of Kanye West's new album was a monumental event, but not because of the fashion show, the Twitter controversy or the insane level of anticipation. The Life of Pablo has hastened the death of the first golden era of music streaming. The music streaming landscape is now effectively segmented to the point where, as a consumer, it's inconvenient to have just one streaming service. Having to pay for more than one streaming service is of course par for the course in video—long gone are the days where it makes any sense to make do with just Netflix. Likewise, gone are the day where you can fire up Spotify and play basically any song. Spotify has no Taylor Swift albums and only a handful of songs from various soundtracks she's done. Some of the Taylor Swift albums are on Tidal, but not 1989. All of her albums are available on Apple Music. Prince's new single (but almost nothing else) is available on Spotify, all of his music is available on Tidal, and a random smattering of his songs are available on Apple Music. Long the butt of jokes for its lackluster interface and over-the-top, star-studded launch, Tidal is now the only place you can listen to West's TLOP or Beyonce's ""Formation"". After a period of Tidal exclusivity, Rihanna's Anti is now finally available on Apple Music and Spotify. These exclusives (or maybe just the spectacle that is TLOP) has catapulted Tidal to the number one spot on the App store for the first time ever. That doesn't mean Tidal wins or is the best music service. And it doesn't mean that you're going to have to subscribe to Tidal and Apple Music and Spotify, all while remembering which songs from which artists are on which specific streaming service (the playlist-obsessed of us are horrified at the prospect). Instead, this is likely an untenable situation. Apple can weather the heavy economic losses usually associated with music streaming, but it's hard to imagine a scenario in which Tidal and its 1 million-ish subscribers—TLOP or not—can make ends meet for much longer. By all accounts, it's losing lots and lots of money and it's paying more for its music than Spotify or Apple is. Even if some Spotify users jump ship for Tidal's better library, how is the company going to become profitable in an industry in which likely no streaming service is (Spotify, Pandora, and Tidal all lose money; Rdio was bought out; Google Play and Apple Music numbers aren't known)? So what's next? Music streaming seems to be an industry in which competition is bad for the consumer. As long as Tidal and Apple Music and Spotify manage to all stay afloat and continue to woo exclusive albums, we're going to keep seeing this fragmentation. And with that fragmentation likely comes a return to the old days of piracy. It's impossible to stream TLOP on Spotify, for instance, but as some are quick to point out, it is possible to torrent it, import it into Spotify, and make it available offline on your phone. As long as Spotify or Apple Music or Tidal have most of what you want, you'll probably see people make do with whatever is available and augment their downloaded libraries with purchased or pirated music. Eventually, when a clear winner emerges, we'll see consolidation once again. Whether that's a good or a bad thing, well, that depends on whether the company that emerges is willing (and able, financially) to treat both consumers and artists fairly. Update: This article has been updated to note that Rihanna's Anti is now available on Apple Music and Spotify. These exclusivity periods are maddening, right?",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wnxdj4/kanye-west-the-life-of-pablo-and-tidal-have-killed-music-streaming,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,614
2016-12-13 16:27:00,2016,12.0,13,Flint Is Going Into Its Third Year Without Clean Water,"The water crisis in Flint, Michigan, over two years old now, has been widely regarded as one of the worst public health disasters in American history. The Virginia Tech researchers, who first confirmed Flint residents' fears that their water was tainted over a year agoo, published their latest round of tests this week announcing another remarkable drop in lead levels. It's an amazing feat considering where things stood almost a year ago. But while significant progress has been made in cleaning up the tap, many lead pipes still need replacing, many Flint residents still must use bottled water, and Flint residents are still not being included in discussions of the solutions going forward. First, some background. Flint used to get its tap water from the city of Detroit, who sourced theirs from Lake Huron. Then in a cost-cutting move in April 2014, officials in Flint opted out of Detroit's water supply and instead began drawing water from the Flint River. The river water was highly corrosive, and as it pumped through the city's many old lead pipes, it slowly ate away at the metal. As a result, the corroded pipes leached high amounts of lead into the water, and flowed into people's faucets. The number of children in Flint with elevated lead levels in their blood doubled, even tripled, in some parts of the city. Lead poisoning in children can lead to cognitive impairment, behavioral disorders, lower IQ, and decreased hearing ability. After a year of pleas about the acrid, discolored water that was being pumped into their homes, Flint's residents, with the help of some Virginia Tech researchers, convinced the state government that there was a problem. In October, 2015 the city switched it's water back to the Detroit supply. The hope was that with time, the leaching pipes would eventually subside after being flushed with the less corrosive water. Lead filters and bottled water were distributed en masse by National Guard soldiers. Despite the cleaner water source and the lead filters, the corroded service pipes running into people's houses can still leach lead, so the city is currently going through the arduous process of removing and replacing all of the lead-pipe service lines attached to Flint residents' homes. Over 200 have been replaced so far—out of thousands. It's an effort likely to takes months, or years, to complete and comes with a $234 million price tag.  After all of this clean up work, Flint's drinking water and the livelihoods of its citizens stand in perpetual limbo.  As the treated water from Detroit flows through the city's water systems, the levels of lead continue to fall. In spite of this progress, however, residents must still rely on lead filters and bottled water—perhaps for as long as there are still lead pipes in the ground. In fact, amid concerns that there are still residents without lead filters, a district court judge in Michigan recently ruled that the city was obligated to provide every household with bottled water. There are about 34,000 households in Flint.  ""There are some outcomes that are less than optimal, packaged with some outcomes that have been incredibly good. The story is more complicated than I think is often times portrayed,"" medical anthropologist Yanna Lambrinidou told Motherboard. Lambrinidou has studied lead contamination in drinking water for years and was on the Flint Water Interagency Coordinating Committee put together by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder to develop long term solutions to the problem. She also lived through one of America's worst drinking water crises in the early 2000's when lead contamination was discovered in the nation's Capital. Lambrinidou pointed out that noticeably absent from any deliberations or efforts to find long-term solutions to the problem are the people of Flint—who have suffered through it all. ""As somebody who has studied this policy quite extensively and as somebody who has lived through a similar crisis, I can tell you that I am deeply concerned about the fact that to this day Flint residents do not have the type of participation that I would expect, given the knowledge and experience they have amassed and continue to gather."" Isaiah Glover, a resident of Flint and father of two daughters, told podcast Tiny Spark in an interview that early on in the crisis he made a decision to trust the government when they were telling residents that the water was safe. ""And I'm going to have to deal with that for a long time,"" he said. ""As a parent you never rid yourself of that guilt.""  ""One of the tragedies of this crisis,"" Glover lamented, ""is the erosion of trust in our community—trust in government, trust in systems. And that's something that's going to take a long time to heal."" Unless residents are part of the discussions on long term solutions, it might never. After being called upon for almost a year now to deliver aid to Flint, Congress appeared to have come to some kind of a compromise earlier this week that would authorize giving the beleaguered city $170 million. But last minute squabbling over details of the bill unrelated to the aid money could result in disappointment for Flint residents yet again.  The aid is packaged in a much larger, almost unwieldy, bill that also addresses drought relief in California and revamping waterways infrastructure around the U.S. Eleventh hour changes in wording, however, has upset some of the bill's original backers. There still has yet to be a vote on the matter, and Congress could be closing up shop for the year's end as early as this weekend.

2018-12-17 00:00:00,2018,12.0,17,South Africa's Naspers leads $540 million investment in Indian tech startup,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Naspers and Canada’s state pension fund have invested $540 million in Indian educational technology startup Byju’s, the South African internet giant said on Monday. Bengaluru-based Byju’s launched a learning app in 2015 that offers tools for school students in India, a country with the world’s largest number of children in primary education. The latest investment values the firm at around $3.6 billion, Indian media reported. “The investment will drive the Byju’s team to further innovate, explore and set new benchmarks for tech-enabled learning products,” Naspers said in a statement. “The company has plans for international market expansion and will make bold investments.” Byju’s has over 30 million registered students, Naspers said, without giving details of the company’s financial performance. Founded more than 100 years ago, Naspers has transformed itself from a newspaper publisher into an $87 billion empire, thanks to its one-third stake in Chinese tech giant Tencent. Naspers shares weren’t trading on Monday due to a public holiday in South Africa. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), one of the world’s biggest investors, is expanding its interests in India due to the country’s young population and growing middle class, its chief executive said last week. Other investors in Byju’s include Tencent and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a charity founded by Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan.

2016-09-09 00:00:00,2016,9.0,9,"Use statins? They do you more good than harm, says study","The risks surrounding the use of cholesterol-control drug statins have been exaggerated and users should be aware of the ""devastating"" consequences for those that have stopped using them, a study has found. A major review of the use, safety and efficacy of statins, which are used to reduce ""bad"" cholesterol and anyone at risk of developing cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes, found that the absolute benefits of statin therapy outweighed the risks of any adverse side effects of the drugs. ""Statin therapy has been shown to reduce vascular disease risk during each year it continues to be taken, so larger absolute benefits would accrue with more prolonged therapy, and these benefits persist long term,"" the review, authored by Professor Rory Collins from the University of Oxford's Nuffield Department of Population Health, said. ""The only serious adverse events that have been shown to be caused by long-term statin therapy—ie, adverse effects of the statin—are myopathy (defined as muscle pain or weakness combined with large increases in blood concentrations of creatine kinase), new-onset diabetes mellitus, and, probably, hemorrhagic stroke,"" the study noted, adding that the number of people potentially affected by adverse side effects was small. ""Statin therapy may cause symptomatic adverse events (that is, muscle pain or weakness) in up to about 50–100 patients (ie, 0•5–1•0 percent absolute harm) per 10 000 treated for five years."" The medical review, published in The Lancet medical journal on Thursday, stated that other scientific studies into statins had overlooked their positive effects: ""Claims that statins commonly cause adverse effects reflect a failure to recognize the limitations of other sources of evidence about the effects of treatment."" Statins work by inhibiting the production of an enzyme involved in cholesterol production in the liver which can lead to a hardening and narrowing of the arteries and cardiovascular disease (CVD) which can include heart attacks, angina, strokes and coronary heart disease. The U.S.' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that 73.5 million adults in the U.S. have high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or ""bad"" cholesterol and that fewer than 1 out of every 3 adults (29.5 percent) with high LDL cholesterol ""has the condition under control."" People with high total cholesterol have approximately twice the risk for heart disease as people with ideal levels, the center added. Statins have been the go-to tablet of choice to treat or prevent cardiovascular diseases associated with bad cholesterol, as well as doctors advising patients to make healthy lifestyle changes. Statins have received some bad press in recent years, however, with reports of side effects, ranging from muscle pain and memory loss to severe effects such as kidney failure, being reported by the media and attributed to statin use. However, the study found that placebo-controlled randomized trials ""have shown definitively that almost all of the symptomatic adverse events that are attributed to statin therapy in routine practice are not actually caused by it (ie, they represent misattribution)."" ""Consequently, any further findings that emerge about the effects of statin therapy would not be expected to alter materially the balance of benefits and harms,"" the study continued. In fact, the team behind the study found that the bad reputation of statins could be responsible for unnecessary deaths among people who have stopped using statins because of erroneous reports on their safety. ""It is, therefore, of concern that exaggerated claims about side-effect rates with statin therapy may be responsible for its under-use among individuals at increased risk of cardiovascular events. For, whereas the rare cases of myopathy and any muscle-related symptoms that are attributed to statin therapy generally resolve rapidly when treatment is stopped, the heart attacks or strokes that may occur if statin therapy is stopped unnecessarily can be devastating.""

2019-11-26 00:00:00,2019,11.0,26,Microsoft's holiday ad shows off language translation technology,"Microsoft's new holiday ad will promote the company's voice language translation technology, highlighting an area where the software giant is going head to head with Amazon and Google. The ad, which premieres Thursday during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, touts Microsoft Translator, a cloud service that can translate dozens of languages. In the commercial, a six-year-old girl watches as her mother takes part in a conference call from home as her colleagues speak in Japanese and uses her Surface tablet to translate for her. The ad was made with Microsoft's ad agency, Interpublic Group's McCann. The girl later takes the tablet outside into the snow to try to talk to two reindeer. Once she realizes she's able to translate their snorts into English using the Surface device, she fires off a number of questions like, ""What does Santa do in the summer?"" and ""Is Mrs. Claus a good cook?"" Real-time language translation has been an area of research at Microsoft, Amazon and Google, the three leading U.S. providers of cloud infrastructure. All three companies operate speech assistants that can translate spoken words and sentences and offer text translation technologies for other businesses to weave into applications. Kathleen Hall, Microsoft's corporate vice president of brand, advertising and research, told CNBC that this year's holiday ad follows a theme from recent years focusing on how technology can bring people together instead of creating barriers. In a previous spot, musician Common showed how Microsoft uses artificial intelligence to analyze camera-trap images for snow leopard sightings to help conservation efforts. In Microsoft's Super Bowl ad this year, called ""We All Win,"" the company focused on a child, Owen Sirmons, with a rare genetic disorder called Escobar syndrome, which limits physical movement. Owen is shown using an Xbox Adaptive Controller to play with his friends. The boy also starred in the company's holiday ad from last year, which shows his friends running through the neighborhood to watch him win a game using the controller. ""I think the theme was really building off last year: What does technology do to make the world better for people, or bring them together?"" Hall said. Microsoft's market cap topped $1 trillion this year, and the stock is up 49% in 2019 as of Monday's close. While language translation is a potentially lucrative business for Microsoft, Hall said regardless of how the company is performing it thinks about campaigns like this the same way. ""If you're making a lot of money or you're not, you should have the same basic values,"" she said. ""The DNA of the company doesn't change."" The commercial, which will run across TV, cinema, digital and social channels through December, finishes by saying, ""Happy Holidays in 60+ Languages. Reindeer isn't one of them.

2016-07-25 00:00:00,2016,7.0,25,Colombia declares end to Zika epidemic inside country,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian health officials declared on Monday that the worst of a Zika outbreak in the Andean nation had passed just 10 months after its arrival, raising questions about how the virus is affecting parts of Latin America differently. Vice Health Minister Fernando Ruiz told journalists that the number of infections in Colombia has been falling by 600 cases a week. While Zika is still circulating in the country, Colombia considers the drop-off sufficient to say it has moved into an endemic phase from the epidemic phase. “We can declare that the epidemic is ended. Colombia is the first country on the American continent to declare an end to the epidemic,” Ruiz said. Zika has struck hardest in Brazil, where the outbreak was first detected last year, and has since spread rapidly through the Americas. The disease can cause the devastating birth defect microcephaly, a condition defined by abnormally small head size which can lead to severe developmental problems in infants, as well as other neurological problems. Brazil has reported more than 1,600 cases of microcephaly linked to Zika, a spike not replicated elsewhere to date. Colombia’s Zika outbreak has been closely monitored by infectious disease experts to understand whether the virus will affect other countries in a similar manner to Brazil. Colombia has reported nearly 100,000 cases of infection, with 21 cases of Zika-related microcephaly. Some disease experts say they are reluctant to say the worst of the outbreak has passed in Colombia, particularly with mosquito season due to resume in the country within a few months, and the many unknowns surrounding the first mosquito-borne virus that can also be transmitted through sexual contact. “It’s difficult to make predictive statements on an epidemic when the vast majority of cases go unreported,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. About 80 percent of Zika infections are believed to be asymptomatic. “There is a possibility that it has not taken hold in Colombia as it has in Brazil and Puerto Rico, but we’re not going to know the full impact of this epidemic for several more months until we see whether additional waves of microcephaly cases are born,” Hotez said. British scientists predicted earlier this month that it will take two to three years for the current Zika outbreak to come to an end in Latin America, assuming that enough people have been infected and become immune to the virus. Colombia’s Health Ministry has also lifted its recommendation that women delay pregnancy because of the virus, Ruiz said, though there may be new outbreaks of the disease in future. Colombia expects that there will be an uptick of cases of microcephaly in September and October, Ruiz said, when pregnant women infected during the peak of the epidemic will give birth. The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults. Colombia has reported 350 cases of the condition connected to Zika. There is no vaccine or treatment for Zika, which is a close cousin of dengue and chikungunya and causes mild fever, rash and red eyes in cases with symptoms.

2017-06-20 00:00:00,2017,6.0,20,Tencent-backed Indian messaging app Hike rolls out payments services,"India's home-grown instant messaging service Hike on Tuesday announced wide-ranging updates to its app, including a new mobile wallet that lets users send and receive money instantly. The Hike Wallet has several features, including a linkage to the government-backed unified payments interface that allows free and instant bank-to-bank money transfer, even if the recipient does not use the Hike app. UPI is a system that was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India which allows a single mobile application to access different bank accounts in a safe and secure environment. Users can also use the Hike wallet to recharge prepaid phones and pay postpaid bills from within the app. Additionally, Hike is introducing Blue Packets, which are personalized digital envelopes that can be used to send monetary gifts for various occasions — the money will be transferred to the recipient's Hike wallet. ""It's one step further in our vision to make Hike a messaging platform that will change the way people interact with content and services,"" Kavin Bharti Mittal, founder and CEO of Hike Messenger, told CNBC about the new features. Mittal is the son of Sunil Mittal, founder and chairman of Bharti Enterprise, which owns one of India's largest telecommunication networks, Bharti Airtel. The concept of a Blue Packet is very similar to WeChat's electronic red packets, which represent the traditional practice of giving red packets filled with cash during Lunar New Year. Users can put money into these electronic packets, personalize it with a message and send it to their friends or family for various occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries or just to thank them. To make it more entertaining, users have the option to send a select number of packets to a group chat, which would work on a first come, first served basis, with the packets expiring in 24 hours. ""We believe money can be the latest form of expression,"" Mittal said. He also acknowledged some of the new payment features were inspired by WeChat's parent company Tencent, which led a $175 million funding round in Hike last year along with Foxconn, that valued the company at $1.4 billion. Tencent also owns the other hugely popular messaging service in China — QQ. ""Some of the features we talked about in payments today have been inspired by Tencent and China. No doubt about that,"" said Mittal. ""We talk to them very often, we visited their offices multiple times to get a sense of what's happened in the last six to seven years in China."" He added, ""It's a very important thing because we still believe India's about four to five years behind China."" India is an attractive test bed for many technology companies because of its demographics: It has a young and growing population, and many people are connecting to the Internet for the first time — usually through a smartphone. Local media reported that research from Internet and Mobile Association of India and IMRB International found the number of Internet users in the country is expected to reach 450 million to 465 million by June, registering a 4 to 8 percent jump from December 2016. The report indicated internet penetration is currently around 31 percent. The smartphone market is also growing at a much quicker pace than the global average and, according to the June Ericsson Mobility Report, India added about 43 million mobile subscriptions in the first quarter of 2017. The report attributed the strong subscription growth in India to an attractive offer of free voice and data services by one of the local telco operators. This provides scalability: Hike, for example, was founded in 2012, but has already amassed more than 100 million registered users, which is nearly a tenth of India's population. Mittal said the average user spends about 24 minutes a day on Hike, but he declined to disclose Hike's number of monthly active users. The market's lucrative prospects mean competition is stiff. Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Messenger are two of the most-downloaded non-gaming apps on Google's Play Store, according to data compiled by U.S. venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers. Earlier this year, WhatsApp announced it hit 200 million monthly active users in India. Mittal, however, pointed out the big market size in India leaves room for more than one instant messaging service: ""We've seen globally that we have multiple messaging apps that are very big in multiple countries like China, Japan — even the U.S. and Europe."" ""For us to win, other messengers don't have to lose,"" he said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/20/tencent-backed-indian-messaging-app-hike-rolls-out-payments-services.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,750

The drug competes with Merck & Co’s Keytruda and belongs to a class of treatments that work by activating the immune system to attack tumors. Both treatments have racked up approvals for indications, including melanoma, lung cancer and head and neck cancer. Sales of both the drugs are neck and neck, with Opdivo generating $1.63 billion in the second quarter and Keytruda $1.67 billion. Bristol-Myers said Opdivo is the first immunooncology treatment approved for patients with small cell lung cancer, which accounts for about 10 to 15 percent of all lung cancers.

2016-04-27 00:00:00,2016,4.0,27,Uber's new policy fines riders who are two minutes late,"Ride-sharing giant Uber is piloting a new cancellation policy in New York City, New Jersey, Phoenix, and Dallas, TechCrunch reported. The policy reduces the amount of time riders have to cancel trips and the amount of time drivers have to wait before charging tardy passengers. The pilot began two days ago, but was soon paused due to a bug. Uber expects to relaunch it today, and run it for several weeks. If the policy becomes permanent, it will change two things: first, riders will have two minutes, rather than five, to cancel a trip without incurring a penalty. Second, if drivers wait more than two minutes for passengers to arrive, they can charge the city's per-minute rate for every minute waited. In other cities where the pilot program is not launching, passengers still have five minutes to get to their Uber before they are charged a no-show fee, and drivers cannot start the trip until they have arrived. After two minutes, riders are charged for every minute they're late As Uber explained in an interview with The Verge, this new policy doesn't change when riders are charged a cancellation fee. Drivers are free to cancel a trip at any point before a rider shows up, but even under the new policy they must still wait five minutes before charging a no-show fee. If drivers leave after waiting for four minutes, they will receive neither the cancellation fee nor the money accrued for two minutes of wait time. The feature was built in response to drivers' complaints about waiting for passengers, Uber said. In a statement released to The Verge and TechCrunch, Uber said that these updated terms would ensure that ""the whole system runs more smoothly and the Uber experience improves for everyone."" Reduced wait times and the ability to charge for idle time, as well as compensation if riders cancel after two minutes, obviously benefit drivers, earning them a few extra dollars and allowing them to move onto the next fare sooner. But how this will make the passenger experience smoother is unclear. Traffic, wrong turns, and faulty GPS all contribute to making pick-up times unreliable. This can leave passengers out in the cold, waiting for drivers to arrive. Uber explained that if a driver is more than five minutes late for an estimated arrival, users can cancel the ride with no penalty. Unreliability can swing in the other direction, too. Drivers may arrive sooner than anticipated, which could lead to passengers being charged extra wait time. TechCrunch included a screenshot from an UberX that arrived two minutes ahead of schedule; theoretically, a rider could have missed the two-minute window and incurred fines. The whole system runs more smoothly and the Uber experience improves for everyone The new policies seem to be aimed mostly at keeping drivers happy — a big problem for Uber. The company recently settled a class action lawsuit with drivers in California and Massachusetts. While the settlement may bring drivers as much as $100 million in compensation and give them the right to request cash tips (tipping isn't built into the app), it does not address their main grievance of being independent contractors rather than employees. How passengers will respond to this pilot program remains to be seen. Uber does not anticipate that the new policies will encourage drivers to ditch riders who don't show up promptly more than they already do. The $5 or $10 fee charged after five minutes of waiting still exceeds the per-minute rates in each city, so it is to a driver's advantage to wait five minutes before moving onto the next fare. And Uber hopes that this policy will encourage riders to call a car when they're actually ready — and hustle to the curb when their ride arrives.",https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/27/11520076/uber-late-rider-fee-each-minute-new-policies,Tech,The Verge,technology,630

""They've got to embrace this company as a media company,"" he said. ""I want to believe that if Yahoo had fully embraced media, it [could have] had a real place over the last four years in that space,"" said Levinsohn. A big part of Twitter's problem is the that the company's leadership is not focusing on its strengths — which is delivering real-time information and breaking news, Levinsohn said. ""It is a delivery mechanism and a distribution mechanism,"" he said. Twitter beat Wall Street's expectations on Wednesday by posting better than expected earnings. But Levinsohn says while the company did a good job of shaping its narrative it isn't out of the woods yet. ""The best thing they did here was manage expectations.

Still, Levinsohn sees value in the company especially if it shifts its strategy and focuses on things like scaling video content on the platform. ""There are hundreds of millions of people around the world who use it, and embrace it,"" he said. If Twitter can't pull this off, Levinsohn said there are plenty of companies that would want to buy it. ""I could list four our five. , , , and , "" he said.

2020-01-14 00:00:00,2020,1.0,14,"Climate crisis, epidemics among next decade's urgent health challenges, WHO says"," (CNN)Climate change, infectious diseases, anti-vaxxers and antimicrobial resistance all made their way onto the World Health Organization's list of health challenges facing the next decade. The list, published on Monday, was developed with input from experts around the world and presented ""urgent, global health challenges,"" according to WHO, the United Nations' public health agency. ""The list reflects a deep concern that leaders are not investing enough resources in core health priorities & systems, putting lives & economies in jeopardy,"" WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote in a Tweet on Monday. ""We need to realize that health is an investment in the future. Countries invest heavily in protecting their people from terrorist attacks, but not against the attack of a virus, which could be far more deadly & far more damaging economically & socially,"" he wrote. ""We face shared threats & we have a shared responsibility to act."" Last year, WHO published a list of 10 global health threats for the year 2019, which also included climate change, antimicrobial resistance, weak primary health care and vaccine hesitancy.  WHO noted that the challenges listed for the next decade are urgent, many are interlinked and none take higher priority than another.  WHO also noted that all of the challenges demand a response from not just the health sector, but governments, communities and international agencies working together.  Here is the WHO's list of health challenges for the next decade, along with a snapshot of what each challenge involves. Climate crisis as a health crisis WHO called the current climate crisis ""a health crisis"" on its list, noting, for instance, that air pollution kills an estimated 7 million people every year. Climate change also has been linked with more extreme weather events, malnutrition and the spread of infectious diseases, such as malaria. ""Leaders in both the public and private sectors must work together to clean up our air and mitigate the health impacts of climate change,"" according to WHO. Health care amid conflict and crisis Meanwhile, a troubling trend continued in 2019 in which health workers responding to medical needs in areas of conflict were targeted with violence. Last year, WHO recorded 978 such attacks on health care in 11 countries, with 193 deaths. When an Ebola outbreak hit the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018, conflict between militant groups and government forces made it difficult for health workers to access some of the hardest hit areas. ""Ultimately, we need political solutions to resolve protracted conflicts, stop neglecting the weakest health systems, and protect health care workers and facilities from attacks,"" according to WHO. Making access to health care fairer for everyone The WHO list also focused on significant health disparities, including persistent and growing gaps in who has access to quality health care based on income and other socio-economic factors. Overall, WHO noted that there is an 18-year difference between rich and poor countries in life expectancy -- and, as a separate challenge, about one-third of the world's people lack access to medicines, vaccines, diagnostic tools and other essential health products.  ""Low access to quality health products threatens health and lives,"" according to WHO. The organization called for all countries to allocate 1% more of their gross domestic product to primary health care, to give more people access to services they need close to home. Stopping infectious diseases, preparing for epidemics Infectious diseases -- such as human immunodeficiency virus or HIV, tuberculosis, viral hepatitis and malaria, among others -- will kill an estimated 4 million people around the world this year, most of them poor, according to WHO. To stop the spread of infectious diseases, WHO said that greater political will and increased funding is needed for health services, routine immunizations, improvements in the quality and availability of data and increased efforts to mitigate the effects of drug resistance. Separately, WHO noted that the world spends more responding to disease outbreaks, natural disasters and other health emergencies, than it does preparing for and preventing them -- and that needs to change. Unsafe food and tobacco products Lack of food, unsafe produce and unhealthy diets are responsible for nearly one-third of the current global disease burden, according to WHO, and while hunger and food insecurity pose significant health challenges, so do obesity and unhealthy diets. WHO added to its list that ""tobacco use is declining in a few but rising in most countries, and evidence is building about the health risks of e-cigarettes."" In general, WHO said that it has been working with countries to help reshape food systems and to build political commitment and capacity to strengthen the implementation of certain tobacco control policies. Investing in health workers and teens  The world will need 18 million additional health workers by 2030 in low- and middle-income countries -- and that includes 9 million nurses and midwives, according to WHO. WHO said that it has been working with countries to stimulate new investment to ""train health workers and pay them decent salaries.""  As a separate challenge, WHO pointed to a global need to invest in the safety of teens and adolescents too. More than 1 million adolescents ages 10 to 19 die every year, according to WHO. The leading causes of death among that age group include road injury, HIV, suicide, lower respiratory infections and violence. This year, WHO said that it will issue new guidance for policymakers, health practitioners and educators to help promote adolescents' mental health and prevent the use of drugs, alcohol, self-harm and interpersonal violence. The guidance will also provide young people with information about preventing HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, as well as information about contraception use and care during pregnancy and childbirth, according to WHO. Anti-vaxxers and new technology The public's trust in doctors can influence whether they follow recommendations around vaccinations, taking medicines and even using condoms, according to WHO. WHO has worked with social media platforms, such as Facebook and others, to help ensure that social media users receive accurate health information and not misinformation. ""Public health is compromised by the uncontrolled dissemination of misinformation in social media, as well as through an erosion of trust in public institutions,"" according to WHO, which noted that the anti-vaccination movement has played a role in that. As a separate challenge, WHO also pointed to how new technologies, such as human genome editing, can be used to prevent diseases, as well as diagnose and treat many illnesses. WHO said that it has been working with countries to help enable them to plan, adopt and benefit from new technologies while also supporting better regulation for their development and use. Medicines and clean facilities WHO also noted that antimicrobial resistance could reverse advancements made in medicine.  Antimicrobial resistance refers to the ability of bacteria, viruses and some parasites to develop ways to block medicines used to fight them, so that the medicines may no longer work.  Among myriad factors, sometimes that resistance can occur when antibiotics or other medicines are used unnecessarily, allowing for bacteria or other microorganisms to develop resistance. In response, WHO said that it not only has been working with national and international authorities to reduce the threat of antimicrobial resistance but also has advocated for research and development into new antibiotics. Separately, WHO also has advocated for improvements in water, sanitation and hygiene conditions, specifically in health facilities. Roughly one in four health facilities globally lack basic water services, according to WHO. The health organization has set a global goal for all countries to have water, sanitation and hygiene services included in plans, budgets and implementation efforts by 2023, and, by 2030, all health care facilities around the world should have basic water, sanitation and hygiene services, the agency said.

2017-01-18 00:00:00,2017,1.0,18,Pangea196 lets millennials travel the world and work while doing it,"Digitally-connected millennials looking for adventure can now use startups to facilitate their travels from Bali to Bulgaria while simultaneously working remotely. Nomads are described by PSFK, a consulting firm, as being driven by productivity, connectivity and global utility. Put plainly, digital nomads are location-independent workers who use technology to eke out a living while simultaneously working remotely and travelling. One of the businesses capitalizing on this trend is Pangea196. Based out of Houston, Texas, the company arranges a year-long sojourn for participants across 12 countries. Among the countries traversed are Ecuador, Uruguay, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Thailand and China. Pangea196 charges a fee for settling travel logistics and participants also have to foot the bill for living expenses. What the start-up doesn't do: Find employment for those who want to participate in the journey. Lawrence Kalinov, the co-founder of Pangea196, says that aspiring digital nomads first have to apply and pass a screening process in order to be a part of the action to ensure that they will a good fit with the group. ""We're looking for high-achieving people in a variety of industries and (from) a variety of backgrounds,"" he said. ""The idea came from a friend who had lost their job in the oil and gas industry, and was looking for a way they (could) do consulting but travel the world at the same time. It could actually be cheaper while you're in other parts of the world rather than living in the United States,"" Kalinov explained. ""Instead of hanging out at the local Starbucks, they can actually be travelling the world during this time. And we also think it's really important that when people are working independently, that they still have some sort of structure in their day. By having the shared office spaces and the other people in the group, we're trying to provide that so that they can still be productive,"" Kalinov added. Remote workers who prefer greater spontaneity can also turn to the many blogs and online resources set up by members of the digital nomad community to plan their own work and play itineraries. One of these resources is Nomad List, a platform that provides reviews on the best cities for people to work remotely in. Factors ranging from cost of living to racial tolerance are taken into consideration when ranking the cities and while the site began as a crowd sourced spread sheet, city editors now vet information for accuracy. Chiang Mai currently takes the crown on Nomad List as the most ""nomad friendly"" city, with Austin, Miami and Canggu (Bali) and Dallas rounding up the top 5 cities. ""I think with the increased ease and decreased cost of travel, people will continue to be more mobile … Working remotely is not niche anymore. It's becoming an employee benefit that companies need to offer to keep attracting high-skilled talent,"" Pieter Levels, the founder of Nomad List, told CNBC in an email. Currently, 1,500 paying users access Nomad List daily. A majority of users are aged between 25 and 35, and work as software developers or designers, a Nomad List spokesperson told CNBC. In addition, most users tend to be from the U.S., the UK, India and Germany. The increasing popularity of digital nomadism could potentially be psychologically beneficial for the workforce. In a survey conducted by TINYpulse, a human resource solutions firm, remote workers in the U.S. reflected feeling happier and more valued at work when compared to the average of workers across all work arrangements.

2020-02-11 00:00:00,2020,2.0,11,U.S. lawmakers hear arguments for new safeguards for self-driving cars,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House panel on Tuesday heard from advocates of imposing stricter safeguards for self-driving cars as part of any effort to speed the adoption of the vehicles on U.S. roads. At the same subcommittee hearing, groups representing automakers and tech companies touted benefits of autonomous vehicles and warned the United States risks falling behind China and other countries without new legal backing. U.S. lawmakers have been divided for years over what consumer and legal protections should be added to any self-driving legislation. Significant divisions emerged at Tuesday’s hearing and officials say the effort faces tough odds to win approval before the end of 2020, even as aides plan to release additional discussion drafts of self-driving legislative proposals. Automakers are eager to deploy commercial robotaxi fleets without human controls but none are expected until 2021 at the earliest. Representative Frank Pallone, the Democrat who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee, said at the hearing “appropriate safeguards must be in place — protections to ensure self-driving cars operate safely and adhere to state and local law.” Republicans argue autonomous vehicles are coming “and the question is whether we develop them here or not,” Representative Greg Walden said. Jeffrey Tumlin, a San Francisco transportation official, testified Congress should require manufacturers to include event data recorders in autonomous vehicles to “preserve all information from sensors before a collision” and ensure “every safety incident involving an autonomous vehicle is documented in a national database.” California requires companies testing self-driving cars to disclose all crashes involving the vehicles on public roads, even when under manual control. Those reports are made public as is data on disengagements of self-driving cars. Other states do not require disclosures. John Bozzella, who heads an auto trade association representing General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and others, said “the worst outcome would be for Congress to delay the enactment of meaningful legislation that would establish the needed federal framework to realize these safety and mobility solutions.” Current regulations essentially bar deployment of vehicles without human controls. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) last week granted its first-ever temporary exemption for a fleet of delivery vehicles from SoftBank Group Corp backed Nuro Inc. Automakers oppose requiring airplane-style certification of new autonomous vehicle technologies before they are deployed on U.S. roads. Daniel Hinkle, a counsel at a trial lawyers group, testified “those who are injured or harmed by automated driving must be able to hold the driver manufacturer accountable.” Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the top Republican on the subcommittee, cast the issue in geopolitical terms, noting Chinese self-driving car developers in 2019 “logged the second-most miles of any country testing” in California. Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, urged Congress to require tests for self-driving cars to ensure they can properly detect other vehicles and hazards and call for a mandatory manual override in all self-driving cars. Chase said in the “absence of federal regulation it’s the duty of states and localities” to ensure that self-driving vehicles are safe.

The decision was made at a meeting of national experts on Wednesday, the official said, adding that this position will be reviewed weekly.

2017-06-14 00:00:00,2017,6.0,14,Climate change in schools where it's 'fake news'," (CNN)Eric Madrid teaches advanced sciences, including topics on climate change and evolution, to high school students in the deep-red Texas Hill Country.  As one might expect in this conservative bastion of the nation, some of the students say it's all lies or fake news. ""But that's usually in the beginning of the semester,"" said Madrid, who left a Ph.D.-level research gig to go into public education. ""As I show them data and evidence, that tends to go away."" In fact, Madrid isn't so worrieed about his students. It's the other teachers who concern him: ""I get much more pushback from other teachers than students. Adults have already pretty much made up their minds, and we also don't have the time to sit down and discuss the issues.""   Madrid's situation underscores the confusion that the climate change issue has presented to many schools across the country. Although 97% of climate scientists agree that global warming is linked to the burning of fossil fuels, a majority of middle and high school teachers are not aware of this consensus.  Many of these teachers teach climate change as if it were an ongoing debate within the scientific community. This disconnect between scientists and educators was captured in a recent survey (PDF) by the National Center for Science Education, a nonprofit that works to promote science over ideology. ""Our survey found that relatively few teachers had even a college course that devoted as much as a single class to climate change,"" said Glenn Branch, the center's deputy director, who notes that many teachers present misinformation about climate change or avoid teaching it entirely.    ""Scientists believe that (climate change) is a really big issue, and it's really inconsistent in terms of how it's being taught,"" explained Gerald Lieberman, director of the California State Education and Environment Roundtable, which works closely with the California Department of Education on instructional strategies related to the environment.   Nationally, there continue to be tensions surrounding climate change, with the Trump administration expressing doubts about its validity and seeking cuts in climate research programs. This conflict has trickled down to the state level too -- even in the schools. A bill in the Texas House of Representatives would allow science teachers to teach ""the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of existing scientific theories,"" namely theories around subjects such as climate change, evolution, the origins of life and cloning.  The bill maintains that ""the protection of a teacher's academic freedom is necessary to enable the teacher to provide effective instruction."" The Texas measure mirrors efforts in Idaho and West Virginia, where objections to the inclusion of climate change in state education standards have met with varying degrees of success. There is also a bill in Florida that would make it easier for residents to challenge school textbooks, including those that discuss topics such as climate change and evolution. ""That class of bill is couched in the language of academic freedom,"" said David Evans, executive director of the National Science Teachers Association. ""But teachers shouldn't be permitted to teach things in class that aren't science."" Most of these bills in other states have been defeated. In Iowa, legislators canned a measure that would have prohibited the state Board of Education from adopting the Next Generation Science Standards, which include climate change in the curriculum.   This year, 11 bills designed to alter science education standards have been unsuccessfully introduced across the United States, by sponsors who perhaps have been encouraged by the Trump administration's stance on climate change. Meanwhile, 18 states and the District of Columbia have approved the Next Generation Science Standards, which were developed with the help of several national science organizations and unveiled in 2013. The main critique of these standards is that climate change instruction is largely relegated to Earth and life science classes, not so much to biology, chemistry and physics -- the science subjects that most students focus on in high school. ""Classes where it's natural to discuss climate change have been neglected,"" Branch said. But Evans disagrees, saying that lessons around climate change are in ""appropriate places in the curriculum, based on what kids can learn when."" Ann Akey, who teaches Advanced Placement environmental science and environmental chemistry at Woodside High School in California, concurs with Branch, though in her school they are working on weaving climate change into the bio-chem-physics curricula, taking it further than the science guidelines suggest.   ""California just adopted (the standards) in the last year, so it won't be fully implemented"" for a few years, she said. Lieberman is less sanguine about the speed of implementation, saying it will take seven to 10 years for California to fully execute the standards and a decade or two for the rest of the nation to follow suit. ""These are gigantic (educational) systems,"" he said, ""and that is the core of the problem."" Evans sounded a more positive note, saying he thinks some school districts will adopt the standards before their own state legislatures do. He cited Wisconsin, where the vast majority of school districts seem to have adopted the science standards, even though the state hasn't done so.   ""When we do climate science sessions at our conferences, it's standing-room only,"" Evans said. ""Teachers are anxious to learn the science so that they can take it to their kids."" But in the interim, those on the front lines stress the need for professional development and support. Some are lucky in that department, like Chris Geerer, who teaches sixth-grade general science at Parcells Middle School in Grosse Pointe Woods, Michigan. ""I took a (climate change) class at Michigan Tech a few years ago, but not everybody does that,"" Geerer said. ""Hopefully, as we roll out (our new) middle school curriculum, we will provide teachers with resources and background information, and force them to think about climate change and digest it and be on board and comfortable teaching it, too.""   Madrid adopts a ""show, don't tell"" approach when teaching his Texas students about climate change. He has them track data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. ""I don't tell them anything, just tell them to get the data,"" he said. ""Any location they choose data from will show that it's real."" Branch added that ""state science standards do make a difference, as they influence what's in textbooks, what's in local curricula, and they influence statewide testing, too.  But at the end of the day, when the classroom door closes, it's really going to be the individual teacher who determines whether or not climate change is going to be properly presented or not.""

Google often stops operating online services, including the Inbox email app and the Google+ social network. What makes this one notable is that it ties back to Diane Greene, a former Alphabet board member. Some of the first work on Hire happened at Bebop, a start-up where Greene was founder and CEO. Google bought Bebop for $380 million in 2015, and as part of the acquisition, Greene was brought in to be head of Google's cloud business. That operation includes G Suite, the cloud productivity app portfolio that competes with Microsoft Office, and the Google Cloud Platform, which competes with Amazon Web Services and other offerings. Google's cloud grew under Greene, a former co-founder and CEO of enterprise software company VMware. In 2018 Google announced that it was bringing in more than $1 billion in revenue per quarter. Google announced her departure in November and said that she would be replaced by Thomas Kurian, a longtime Oracle executive. Greene left Alphabet's board earlier this year. Last month Google said that its cloud business is now generating more than $8 billion in revenue on an annualized basis. Google announced Hire in 2017. Cloudera, Dandelion Chocolate, Prosperworks and SADA Systems are among the companies listed on Google's website as users of Hire, which integrates with services like Google Calendar and Gmail. On Tuesday the company informed Hire administrators that it would stop running the service on Sept. 1, 2020. ""While Hire has been successful, we're focusing our resources on other products in the Google Cloud portfolio,"" the company said in the message.  Some people said they were sad to see the announcement.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/27/google-shuts-down-hire-the-product-it-acquired-with-diane-greene.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,297

AT&T’s service hadn’t magically gotten faster, and all the other carriers cried foul. But only Sprint had the guts to sue AT&T over its misleading claims. Now it appears AT&T and Sprint have “amicably resolved” their legal battle, and while the terms have not been fully disclosed, there’s one thing we do know: AT&T will be allowed to continue with its 5G E nonsense.The original suit filed by Sprint back in December alleged that AT&T’s use of 5G E was confusing to the public. Sprint even conducted a survey that showed that 54 percent of consumers thought 5G E was as good or better than true 5G service. But in reality, that perception could not be further from the truth as AT&T’s 5G E is really just a collection of LTE Advanced Pro technology already available on  4G networks. These new features include things like 4X4 MIMO, 256QAM, and new carrier aggregation techniques that allow cellular providers to boost the performance of existing 4G  LTE service. As an example of the difference between 5G E and real 5G, about a month ago, mobile analytics firm OpenSignal discovered that the average download speed for 5G E capable phones on AT&T’s network was around 28.8 Mbps. That’s not bad compared to today’s standards, but when you compared that to the 400 to 500 Mbps speeds I encountered while testing a real 5G network in Chicago, we’re talking about more than a 15x discrepancy. That’s not even close. To further highlight the confusion over 5G E, just yesterday Salesforce founder and CEO Mark Benioff tweeted a message that made it seem like he wasn’t sure if AT&T’s 5G E service in San Francisco was real 5G or not. Now there’s a chance Benioff was being sarcastic and clowning on AT&T, but if he wasn’t, confusion from someone in his position who has actual experience using a real 5G network only further reinforces how misleading AT&T’s 5G E branding is. In a just world, AT&T would not be allowed to display the 5G E icon on devices connected to a 4G network. But sadly, it seems that’s not the case.

2016-09-15 00:00:00,2016,9.0,15,Poll shows 66 percent of California voters favor drug price initiative,"(Reuters) - An initiative on California’s November ballot aimed at reining in prescription drug prices is favored by 66 percent of state voters, according to a new poll released on Thursday. The California Drug Price Relief Act, also known as Proposition 61, seeks to restrict state-run health programs from paying more for medications than prices paid by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which is billed about 25 percent less for drugs than other government agencies. The poll of more than 1,900 registered voters conducted by the University of Southern California (USC) and the Los Angeles Times found that 23 percent opposed the measure. It was conducted in early September, amid a surge in public scrutiny of price hikes for Mylan NV’s EpiPens, the emergency allergy injections. Mylan is the latest company to be caught up in the growing outrage at big drug price hikes. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc and Turing Pharmaceuticals have both been publicly criticized for price increases. On Thursday, a bipartisan group of U.S. Senate and House members, including Arizona Senator John McCain, introduced legislation that would force drug makers to justify to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Resources price increases of more than 10 percent. Opponents of the California measure, led by pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer Inc, Merck & Co Inc and Amgen Inc, have raised $87.5 million to try to stop the measure. Proponents, led by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and the AARP, have raised around $10 million. The Yes on Prop 61 coalition estimates that its plan would save California taxpayers and consumers billions of dollars and “ultimately force the drug companies to moderate price increases across the board.” But opponents, which include some labor unions and patient advocate groups like the California Chronic Care Coalition and the Lupus Foundation of Southern California, worry that a new price system could result in a long bureaucratic process, limiting patient access to vitally needed medications.     Most participants in California’s low-income health program, known as Medi-Cal, are covered through private insurance plans that are paid a fixed fee for individual enrollees.     That means that Proposition 61, if approved, would apply to around 4.5 million Californians, including Medi-Cal fee-for-service, state employees, university teachers and prisoners. It would not affect private employer-sponsored insurance plans, Medicare, or insurance sold on Obamacare exchanges.

2016-01-24 00:00:00,2016,1.0,24,Senior lawmaker urges UK banks to invest in IT to prevent failures,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s banks need to dedicate far greater resources toward securing their IT infrastructure and should have a designated board member overseeing the issue, a senior lawmaker said, following a string of high-profile technology failures. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of parliament’s Treasury Committee, also suggested that Andrew Bailey, the deputy governor of the Bank of England who heads its banks supervisory arm, should be tasked with ensuring the banks develop more resilience. Britain’s retail banks have been hit by a number of technology failures in recent years, causing inconvenience for hundreds of thousands of customers and prompting lawmakers to call for more investment in financial technology. “Every few months we have yet another IT failure at a major bank,” Tyrie said in a statement on Sunday. “These IT blunders and weaknesses are exposing millions of people to uncertainty, disruption and sometimes distress. Businesses suffer, too. We can’t carry on like this.” Tyrie said someone, probably Bailey, the head of the BoE’s Prudential Regulation Authority supervisory arm, needed to take “a leadership role” over an issue that poses systemic risk to the banking system. “Currently, no one group seems to be directly responsible for developing a full understanding of the risks carried,” Tyrie said in a letter to Bailey dated Jan. 22 and published by the committee. “A group of this type should now be formed with the primary task of ensuring that the banks develop more robust resilience to protect banking and payment systems. The head of the PRA may be best suited for the leadership role.” HSBC suffered an online and mobile banking blackout in January while in 2015 thousands of Britons failed to receive their wages when some HSBC business customers were blocked from making payments. State-backed Royal Bank of Scotland has promised to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in its computer systems after a series of high-profile glitches. Some customers at Barclays have also endured problems.

2019-06-28 00:00:00,2019,6.0,28,A Frightening Number of Americans Have Never Gotten Tested for HIV,"Photo:  Getty ImagesFewer than 40 percent of Americans have ever gotten HIV testing, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These rates are even lower in states with rural areas where the  disease is disproportionately more common.The report is based on two years (2016-2017) of national survey data of adults living in areas where the majority of new HIV cases have been diagnosed in recent years. These areas include 50 counties across 20 states and Washington D.C., as well as seven states where rural rates of HIV have been especially high, including Alabama and Missouri. As part of the survey, volunteers were asked if they were screened for HIV in the past year as well as in their lifetime.From there, the authors estimated that only 10 percent of Americans had gotten HIV testing in the past year, while 38 percent had gotten it in their lifetime. Testing rates were higher among some groups thought to be higher risk for HIV, such as men who have sex with men. Counties where HIV was diagnosed more often generally had higher testing rates, too. But the lifetime rate was lower (35.5 percent) in the seven states with higher rural HIV prevalence.For the Second Time, Doctors Say They&aposve Cleared an HIV Infection Using Stem CellsDoctors in London, UK have seemingly accomplished a momentous feat in HIV treatment. They claim to…Read more ReadThe study is all the more sobering because it’s these same areas that are being targeted by the federal government’s upcoming health initiative to dramatically reduce, if not fully eliminate, new cases of HIV by 2030. So right now, the outlook isn’t looking too rosy. “These findings demonstrate missed opportunities to fully implement HIV screening recommendations in the 57 jurisdictions that will serve as the initial geographic focus of the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative,” the authors wrote.HIV, of course, is no longer the death sentence it once was. We’ve gotten to the point that people with the disease live as long as everyone else, so long as they have access to antiretroviral therapy; these drugs can also drive levels of the virus so low as to make the disease impossible to transmit to others. And there have even been promising efforts in finding ways to fully cure the chronic disease in some people.When it comes to ending the epidemic, though, finding a cure to HIV isn’t as impactful (or realistic right now) as simply preventing new cases. And we already have the tools well in hand to accomplish that feat in the near future. Safe sex practices, like condoms, are obviously important, but there’s also pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a medication that can significantly protect people at high risk for HIV from catching it.If people aren’t  vigilant in testing themselves for HIV, though, efforts to contain and prevent the disease will remain undercut. It’s estimated that 1.1 million Americans over the age of 13 may have HIV currently, with as many as 14 percent of HIV-positive people unaware their status. Though untreated HIV can eventually lead to serious complications like AIDS and rare infections, many people initially have few or no obvious symptoms of the disease, which can often resemble the flu at first. You don’t even need to be having sex to catch HIV. Because of that reality, the CDC recommends that people get regularly tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections if they’re between the ages of 13 to 64. People at higher risk for HIV, such as those who have had multiple or recently untested sex partners since their last HIV test, should get tested more often.",https://gizmodo.com/a-frightening-number-of-americans-have-never-gotten-tes-1835955128,Health,Gizmodo,health,604
2017-07-15 00:00:00,2017,7.0,15,Ex-Union Square analyst Joel Monegro starts crypto fund Placeholder,"When cryptocurrency investors talk of influential work in the space, they often point to an August 2016 blog post titled ""Fat Protocols,"" written by an analyst at Union Square Ventures. That analyst, Joel Monegro, is now getting out of the traditional venture world to invest solely in crypto assets. Monegro recently left Union Square to start a crypto fund, joining forces with Chris Burniske, a blockchain expert formerly at ARK Investment Management, according to sources familiar with the matter. The firm—Placeholder Capital—is being structured using the venture model with a 10-year commitment from investors, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the founders haven't publicly talked about their plans. Most sources wouldn't divulge the likely size of the fund, but one said the partners are targeting about $100 million. Crypto funds are opening by the week as investors look to bet on the wild fluctuations in the prices of cryptocurrencies bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin, while also getting stakes in new projects being built on blockchain. Yet, it's a challenging market for venture capitalists. Cryptocurrency projects are not like typical companies with a founder or two and equity to sell. Rather, they're made up of disparate developer teams building blockchain technology and, instead of selling stock for financing, they're distributing tokens or coins through what's called initial coin offerings (ICO). The new currency allows buyers to participate in their network, whether it's buying storage or paying for transactions, and also serves as an investment opportunity. But unlike investing in a company, there's no board seat to be had or preferred shares to own. VCs, who are used to proprietary deal flow and access to non-public information, are now just like everyone else. Furthermore, the assets can be viewed as unregulated securities. ""This is new territory,"" said Nicholas Chirls, a partner at venture firm Notation Capital in New York which is putting a small percentage of its money into crypto investments. ""This ecosystem and market is still so early that the structure of these crowd sales look very different from project to project."" Among traditional venture firms, Union Square has been at the forefront of the crypto movement, investing in crypto hedge funds run by Polychain Capital and MetaStable, and providing early capital to Coinbase, an exchange for buying and selling cryptocurrencies. Union Square is now gearing up to invest directly in ICOs or crypto token sales as soon as this year, said Albert Wenger, a partner at the New York-based firm. ""We do many different things because we don't yet know what's going to work,"" Wenger told CNBC. ""This is a fundamental innovation and a lot of interesting things will get built over time. A lot of other things are unclear, to put it mildly."" Wenger confirmed that Monegro has left Union Square to start his own fund, but he declined to provide any details. Monegro didn't respond to a request for comment. Burniske declined to comment on the new fund except to say that he's not working on a hedge fund as ""some have speculated."" Last week, Burniske tweeted that he's left ARK to ""create something of my own in #cryptoland."" ARK was the first public fund manager to invest in bitcoin, and Burniske held the title of blockchain products lead. In an interview with CNBC last year following the Brexit vote, Burniske called bitcoin a ""disaster hedge,"" due to its low correlation with other assets that sink in periods of uncertainty or crisis. Monegro, meanwhile, was influential in the blockchain space at Union Square. His widely cited post from August argued that the lion's share of the value in crypto is being captured by the major protocols -- bitcoin and ethereum -- as opposed to the applications running on top. That's in contrast to the internet, which saw applications like Google and Facebook attract much more valuable than the web's building blocks. ""Tokenized protocols become 'fat' and its applications 'thin,'"" Monegro wrote. Placeholder won't be the first crypto-specific venture fund. Blockchain Capital and Pantera Capital were both founded in 2013 and invest in a combination of blockchain-based start-ups and crypto tokens. Other investors are diving into cryptocurrency in a big way. Forbes published a piece this week highlighting 15 new crypto hedge funds that are launching between this summer and the end of the year. On Wednesday, Ari Paul, who previously managed money for the University of Chicago and regularly blogs and tweets about crypto, said on Twitter that he's getting ready to launch a new hedge fund called BlockTower Capital. And some of the companies involved are raising IPO-sized rounds even as their technologies or networks are still in the early stages of development. In the past month, crypto projects Tezos, EOS, Bancor and Status have raised over $660 million combined, according to Smith + Crown, a blockchain research, data and consulting group. By way of comparison, ICOs brought in $101 million in all of 2016. That kind of growth is hard to ignore. But traditional VCs are split over whether crypto is worth the risk. Like Union Square, Andreessen Horowitz has invested in Polychain after backing Coinbase, and Bessemer Venture Partners has spent this year studying the market, putting money into some funds and exploring potential coin investments. Ethan Kurzweil, a partner in Bessemer's Silicon Valley office, is working with his New York-based colleague Alex Ferrara to develop the firm's roadmap. ""Our goal is to invest in emerging technologies as early as we can,"" Kurzweil said. ""This started out as a topic in January and February, and we're at a point where we can invest equity in tokens."" Other venture investors don't want to touch this stuff. David Golden, a partner at Revolution Ventures in San Francisco, referred to the ICO phenomenon as a ""house of cards"" and said there's a ""Las Vegas speculative run"" taking place. Roger Lee of Battery Ventures is highly skeptical of ICOs because ""there's not a lot of disclosure or regulation around these offerings right now,"" he said. In other words, they look a lot like securities but they're not registered with the SEC. One thing virtually all tech investors acknowledge is that blockchain, the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies, is here to stay. The digital ledger is already being used for real-world applications like payments, mortgages, legal files and incorporation documents. While the structure may be uncomfortable for venture capitalists, they've seen how much money is potentially at stake. The price of ethereum is up 200-fold since the end of 2015, even after plunging 45 percent in the past month. VCs have to figure out how to add value in a world without board meetings and where Silicon Valley connections carry much less weight. Union Square's Wenger said that investors engaged in these projects can provide the same sort of help they do with start-ups, by promoting them, recruiting talent and providing technical feedback. ""It's many of the same questions,"" Wenger said. ""How do we get people excited about it, make people know it exists, foster adoption of it? If you were able to help companies figure out answers to these questions, you should be able to figure out how to help teams with the same sets of questions.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/13/ex-union-square-analyst-joel-monegro-starts-crypto-fund-placeholder.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,1200

2019-04-17 00:00:00,2019,4.0,17,Xbox to partner with ELEAGUE for Gears of War series,"Microsoft said on Tuesday its Xbox Game Studios will partner with Turner Sports' ELEAGUE to produce a documentary series about ""Gears of War"" players in conjunction with a new version of the video game launching later this year. The series will feature six hour-long programs focusing on the new game, called Gears 5, and the lives of its star players from around the globe. It will debut June 14 on Turner's TBS network. ELEAGUE produces content about esports and live tournaments. It is a partnership between Turner Sports, a unit of AT&T's WarnerMedia, and entertainment talent agency IMG. Esports fans watch live video game tournaments online as well as in packed stadiums. In July, ELEAGUE will also host the first-ever Gears 5 esports tournament and reveal its first multiplayer mode in action, with coverage streamed on Twitch and Bleacher Report Live. Financial terms of the partnership were not disclosed. For Turner, the partnership is another opportunity to serve its sports and entertainment audience while also reaching new segments of the ballooning gaming viewership. ""The audience is the most coveted demographic in the media landscape,"" Craig Barry, chief content officer for Turner Sports, told Reuters. ""We know they're out there, we know they're engaged. No one's really cracked the code yet."" Esports fans are younger, more interactive and often more affluent than other sports audiences. Global esports revenues will grow nearly 27 percent to $1.1 billion this year, according to Newzoo research. Those numbers include all aspects of the industry, so ELEAGUE is targeting a smaller slice with Gears. Gears — developed by The Coalition, a studio within Microsoft's gaming business — has particularly impassioned fans, said Rose Gunson, program manager for Gears of War at Microsoft. ""Our players are very engaging, they have huge personalities.

2020-02-18 16:11:00,2020,2.0,18,A Tech Social Experiment: Calling the Random Saved Numbers in Your Phone,"This article originally appeared on VICE UK. “Omg let’s swap numbers!” you say to the girl in the club toilet who, in passing, said that she liked your fluorescent fanny pack. “Sarah Toilet” you name her, then never think of her again. “Yes, we must hang out,” you nod enthusiastically to the guy in the Uber pool, punching his number into your phone. Again, you forget he exists a mere ten minutes later. “I would love to collaborate with you on a zine,” you say to someone, somewhere. Sophia something? You add her number to your contacts list. Three months later, still no zine. If you own a smartphone, chances are you’ve had the same contact list for a number of years. As time goes on, the names stack up, but still you just DM the same few friends on Instagram/WhatsApp/whichever platform you hate the least. And God forbid you’d ever use your phone to actually call anyone other than your mother. Back in the day, exchanging numbers might have meant something. You might have actually called someone’s house phone for a 30-minute conversation. But in the era of social media, phone calls to people you barely know are almost considered a faux pas. But all of this got me thinking: Social norms are there to be broken. And who knows? Maybe all these names in my phone—“Esme Tinder,” “Kaya Club,” the vague and innocuous “Em”—shouldn’t be viewed as strangers but opportunities for friends I haven’t made yet. There must have been a reason I added them to my phone in the first place. And so, one afternoon, I decide to give a bunch of them a call so we could “chat” in order to “reconnect.” What could go wrong? First, I whittle it down to a shortlist. As someone who uses their phone a lot for work, I have to be careful not to call “Este Haim,” “Jamie Klaxon,” or “Lindsay Lohan PR” because that would be unprofessional. Instead, I go for the names that I have literally no recollection of adding. The names that I cannot for the life of me conjure up a face for. To begin with, I pre-warn a few of these people with a message, but this doesn’t go too well. A few of them have obviously changed numbers because my WhatsApps don't go through. Others ignore me. And one contact, “Emma Gemini,” literally blocks me without replying. So then I go straight for the jugular. The first person I call, “Chris,” picks up after two rings. “Hello?” they ask, with the confident tone of someone who actually uses their phone. I explain that I’m calling people on my contacts list, people I don’t remember, and does he happen to know how we met? “Er, no mate sorry. Daisy did you say?” There’s a pause. “Camden?” I haven’t been to Camden in years, but it’s a possibility. “Sorry I’m at work and there are customers, but... good luck!” he hangs up before I have a chance to piece anything together. Even in that brief 30-second conversation, I cannot imagine why me and Chris would have swapped numbers. I call a few others. They don’t pick up. The next person who does is someone called “Alex T.” I mentally scan all the Alex’s I know. Did I live with an Alex T? Hook up with an Alex T? Have me and any Alex T ever been friends? “Ha, I think we swapped numbers on Tinder but, like, ages and ages ago,” she says (that must account for the “T”). “I remember you because you were really forward, also I follow you on Instagram so…” Why did we stop speaking? “Well I've got a girlfriend now. But also I think that happens a lot on Tinder. You give your number to someone then it just fizzles out when neither of you make the first move.” I like the sound of Alex; we could have been friends. You never know, we could have been lovers in another life, had things worked out differently. But they didn’t, and when we say our goodbyes after exactly one minute and 16 seconds, I get the feeling we won’t speak on the phone again. Next up is “Carter,” which sounds like someone in an American high school rom com from the 2000s. How could I ever know a “Carter?” But just as he picks up, a few vague memories start swimming back. Stoke Newington? 2011, 2012? Did we… did we sleep together? For a moment I feel bad, like what if someone I’d slept with couldn’t remember me? “Daisy… Daisy…” he says, as if racking his brains after I explain why I'm calling. Wow he really can’t remember me, can he? “Were you friends with Rachel?” I was friends with Rachel. I make my excuses and hang up. Fuck you, Carter. By this point I’m getting tired. People don’t seem to want to speak to me, and when they do, it doesn’t really add anything to either of our lives. The last person I try is someone called “Spinner,” who I wish I remembered but honestly I don’t. They sound like the type of person who might send me 3 a.m. WhatsApps about 2-for-1 deals on Stardawg. “Yeah?” They pick up. I explain what I’m doing. “How did you get my number?” they reply cagily. I explain again. They hang up. I wish I could say I learned something valuable and life-affirming from this experiment—that my worldview had expanded a little, that I forged meaningful connections with people who nearly passed me by. If this was a TV show, maybe I'd become best friends or lovers with one of these forgotten contact names. People at parties would ask how we got together and we'd look at each other knowingly and laugh. I'd start by going “Well...” But none of that happened. The phone conversations mainly felt brief—a touch uncomfortable. And if anything it made me realize that the friends you make are the ones you make an effort with, and who make an effort with you. It's good to have a filtration system. Anyone who gets through that filtration system should be there, and vice versa. I'm not suddenly going to get back into having intense phone calls either. They're long. See you in the DMs, or, you know, in real life.

Shares of the company rose 6.4% to $127.70 in extended trading and were on track to open at a record high on Wednesday. The company had previously warned that the slowdown may last a few more quarters, as China's economy cools and manufacturers face the fallout of a prolonged U.S.-China trade dispute. When asked whether the trade dispute was impacting the company's ability to conduct business in China, Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi said, ""No, not at all."" The market was also encouraged by the numbers from one of the first chipmakers to report earnings for the quarter, as there were uncertainties around demand due to higher tariffs and the fallout from China's Huawei Technologies. Texas, whose broad lineup of products makes it a proxy for the chip industry, said it expected third-quarter revenue to be between $3.65 billion and $3.95 billion. The company also estimated a profit of between $1.31 and $1.53 per share. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $3.83 billion and profit of $1.38 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. ""Guidance reflects the improved sequential demand due to seasonality in all of its end-markets, offset by the on-going macro uncertainty,"" Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan said. Chan, however, expressed concerns about the continued choppy demand in industrial and automotive markets due to slowing growth in China. Sales from industrial and automotive units, its fastest growing areas, together accounted for more than half of the company's revenue in 2018. Net income fell to $1.31 billion, or $1.36 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30 from $1.41 billion, or $1.40 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of $1.22 per share.

2016-02-25 00:00:00,2016,2.0,25,Apple iPhone case risks FBI abuses: Rep Himes,"Before Apple creates any software to unlock the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters, the U.S. government needs to ensure it is adequately protected and will not be abused, a member of the House Intelligence Committee contended Thursday. Rep. Jim Himes, a Democrat from Connecticut, said he wants to make sure the FBI can retrieve the data only on the iPhone in question and not other devices. He echoed Apple CEO Tim Cook in questioning how much authority the FBI should have to access Apple devices. ""Before we give this authority, we need to answer the question that Tim Cook asked, which is where are the limits of this authority?"" Himes said on CNBC's ""Closing Bell."" ""We all want to make ourselves absolutely comfortable that once this code exists that Apple is getting asked to write that it is very well protected."" Apple on Thursday filed a motion to vacate a California judge's order compelling the tech giant to make software that would allow the FBI to crack a phone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the shooters in the 2015 attack that left 14 people dead. Apple and others in Silicon Valley fear the order could lead to compromised user data and wider breaches of privacy. ""No court has ever granted the government power to force companies like Apple to weaken its security systems to facilitate the government's access to private individuals' information,"" Apple said in a release. The case has reignited a debate about whether privacy should be sacrificed in order to prevent attacks. The FBI has maintained that the order would only apply to this particular phone. Speaking before a congressional panel Thursday, FBI Director James Comey said the case is ""unlikely to be a trailblazer"" for establishing precedent. Himes argued that the issue should play out in Congress rather than the courts. If Apple does eventually create the software, the government needs to ensure it is not used repeatedly and cannot fall to malicious foreign hackers, Himes argued. — CNBC's Everett Rosenfeld and Reuters contributed to this report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/25/apple-iphone-case-risks-fbi-abuses-rep-himes.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,347
2017-10-30 00:00:00,2017,10.0,30,"Pollution: Over 2,100 cities globally exceed recommended levels"," (CNN)Climate change is already affecting the health of populations around the world, but things are set to get worse if adequate changes aren't made, according to an international consortium of climate experts. Fueling the impact is the fact that more than 2,100 cities globally exceed recommended levels of atmospheric particulate matter -- particles emitted when fuels, such as coal or diesel, are burned and are small enough to get into the lungs -- says a report published Monday in the medical journal The Lancet. In the UK alone, 44 cities exceeded levels recommended by the World Health Organization. Since 1990, exposure to fine particulate matter -- smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter -- increased by 11.2%, the report states, aided by a slow transition away from fossil fuels. Climate change ""is the major health threat of the 21st century,"" said Hugh Montgomery, co-chairman of The Lancet Countdown on health and climate change and director of the Institute for Human Health and Performance at University College London in the UK. ""There's an urgent need to address it."" The latest report highlights multiple health, weather and economic consequences that need immediate attention. Poor air quality ""Air pollution is one of the leading causes of premature mortality globally,"" said Paul Wilkinson, professor of environmental epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who co-authored the report.  More than 803,000 deaths across 21 Asian countries in 2015 were attributable to pollution from coal power, transport and the use of fossil fuels at home, the report states. But there are ""some glimmers of hope,"" he said, such as the fact that coal power peaked in 2013 and is now showing evidence of a decline. Investment in coal also declined from 2013, Wilkinson said, but this ""will take a couple of generations to realize."" Wilkinson urges governments to prioritize moving away from fossil fuels, as their harms to the environment and human health have long been known. But 71% of 2,971 cities in the WHO's air pollution database exceed the organization's annual exposure guideline for particulate matter. Increased disease ""Cases of dengue fever have doubled every decade since 1990,"" Montgomery said. More people are getting it due to climate change, he said, and ""it's going to go up."" Dengue is a virus spread by mosquitoes and can result in fever, headaches and pain. Severe cases can bring a multitude of symptoms including bleeding, shock, organ failure -- and potentially death. There is no treatment or vaccine. Changes in global temperatures, specifically higher temperatures, have increased the range of countries where the mosquitoes carrying the virus can thrive. The WHO estimates that 390 million dengue infections occur globally each year. Deaths from dengue have increased worldwide, particularly in the Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Caribbean regions, the report states.  Heat waves: Increased risk of death, decreased labor Between 2000 and 2016, temperatures rose by 0.9 degrees Celsius where people are living, said Peter Cox, professor of climate system dynamics at the University of Exeter, who also co-authored the report. ""The land is warming much quicker than the ocean,"" he said, highlighting the increased number of heat waves people experience today and the extreme vulnerability of older people. With populations now living longer, the numbers of those vulnerable to heat stresses will only go up. During that same time frame, the number of older people exposed to heat waves increased by roughly 125 million, and the the ability of people to work -- namely to do physical or manual work outdoors -- fell by 5.3%, Cox said, resulting in economic losses for countries. The need to adapt and become resilient Addressing climate change will result in benefits and improvements to public health, but governments are too slow to address the problem, the authors agreed. Although an increasing number of countries started to develop plans and strategies to reduce the impact of climate change, the majority are high-income nations, the report shows. ""Less than a third of countries have done anything so far,"" said Georgina Mace, head of the Center for Biodiversity and Environment Research at UCL, who was also involved in the report. ""In low-income countries in particular, there is low expenditure on adaptation."" Countries can prepare for changes in infrastructure such as transport, electricity and health care supplies, which can be affected by extreme weather events. In addition, policies to reduce use of fossil fuels and entice people toward electric vehicles and renewable energy sources can be prioritized. The report shows that while sales of electric cars have risen to 77 million per year, this is easily lost next to the figure of 1.2 billion: the total number of regular gas- and diesel-fueled cars being driven. Not enough is being done, Mace said. ""Adaptation is going to become more important in the future,"" she said. ""The impact is going to get a lot worse."" ""The indicators reflect the breadth of the transformation that is required to address these public health issues by not only considering the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on health but also considering adaptation and mitigation issues, as well as economic and finance issues as the world moves from a fossil-fuel driven to a low-carbon economy,"" said Clare Goodess, senior researcher at the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, who was not involved in the report. Goodess said more work is needed to improve the attribution of these observations to climate change, a point on which the authors of the report agree. ""Many of the most dramatic trends in health impacts are related to rising temperature and more frequent high-temperature extremes,"" Goodess said. ""The attribution of these temperature trends to human activities is now unequivocal so the urgency of addressing the issues raised by this report is not in doubt.""

2018-01-02 18:00:00,2018,1.0,2,Entitled People Don't Like to Follow Instructions," Entitlement, as they say, is a hell of a drug. A new study examines its effects, finding that people with a greater sense of entitlement are less likely to follow instructions—because they see rules as an unfair imposition. Even when disregarding the rules means receiving punishment, the more-entitled people would rather lose out than submit to a system they perceive as less than fair to them.   The study, which appears in  Social Psychological and Personality Science, follows up on earlier work which showing that more entitled people are less concerned about what’s socially acceptable or serves a greater good. They believe themselves deserving of preferences and resources not given to others—that’s nearly the definition of entitlement—but researchers were less clear on  why people felt that way.   The authors, Emily Zitek of Cornell University and Alexander Jordan of Harvard Medical School, created a series of scenarios. First, they established that yes, entitled people were less likely to follow instructions on a word search game.   Then they began tweaking conditions to suss out the deeper reasons that happened. Maybe entitled people see rule-following as costly to themselves, or view instructions as too controlling. Maybe the threat of punishment could influence them.  More from VICE:   Not so, the researchers found. “We thought that everyone would follow instructions when we told people that they would definitely get punished for not doing so, but entitled individuals still were less likely to follow instructions than less entitled individuals,” Zitek said in a statement. Nor did they follow the rules even when it cost them little, or when the instructions were offered in a less-controlling way.   In another scenario, though, researchers found that entitled people were more sensitive to situations that might seem unfair to them. The final set of experiments built on that finding, showing that ultimately it was a misaligned sense of fairness that led entitled people to ignore instructions. They believed the instructions were unfair to them, so they disregarded them—even if it meant a loss for them.  Needless to say, people who won’t follow instructions can be a real problem. At least now research has shown  why they don’t. That points toward some possible solutions. “A challenge for managers, professors, and anyone else who needs to get people with a sense of entitlement to follow instructions,” Zitek said, “is to think about how to frame the instructions to make them seem fairer or more legitimate.”  Read This Next: Narcissists Are Sick, Stressed, and Insecure",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvwjpp/entitled-people-dont-like-to-follow-instructions,Health,Vice,health,411

2019-10-10 00:00:00,2019,10.0,10,Teen vaping and smoking study: Researchers collect trash from the ground," (CNN)To better understand the vaping epidemic in high schools across the United States, researchers have turned to the ground. Researchers in Northern California have ""systematically scanned the student parking lots and exterior school perimeter areas"" to collect e-cigarette, tobacco and cannabis waste on the ground, according to a note published on Thursday in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. There were differences in what was found on the ground at schools with a predominantly middle- and upper-income student population compared with schools with a lower-income student population. ""E-cigarette waste and combustible tobacco product waste contaminate the Bay Area high schools studied and confirm use of these products by high school students,"" wrote researchers Jeremiah Mock, of the University of California, San Francisco, and Yogi Hendlin, of Erasmus University in the Netherlands, who co-authored the note. ""Cannabis product waste represents an emerging issue,"" they wrote. The note detailed how contamination from e-cigarette product waste, tobacco product waste and cannabis product waste was studied at 12 public high schools in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin and San Francisco counties between July 2018 and April 2019. Across those schools, there were a total of 18,831 students enrolled, and overall 893 waste items were collected, among which 19% came from e-cigarette products. Nearly all of those products were Juul or Juul-compatible pods and pod caps, according to the note. The note described that almost all Juul or Juul-compatible pods and caps were found at schools with predominantly middle- and upper-income student populations. Overall, the note indicated that 64% of pod caps were from mint-flavored and other menthol-flavored pods.  The researchers conducted additional scans at one school in an upper-income area three months after e-cigarette maker Juul announced it was stopping retail sales of flavor products, except Cool Mint and Classic Menthol. Those additional scans yielded 172 mint, 20 mango and four fruit pod caps, as well as three yellow caps, which could have been banana or mango flavors, according to the note. At four high schools with predominantly lower-income students, eight e-cigarette product waste items and 71 little cigar or cigarillo plastic wrappers and mouthpieces were collected, among which 94% were flavored, according to the note. ""The large proportions of flavored products identified in this study are consistent with findings from other studies showing high prevalence rates of flavored e-cigarette and combustible tobacco product use"" among youth, Mock and Hendlin wrote in the note.  Across all schools, 620 cigarette butts and 14 cannabis product waste items were collected, including vaporizer pens, cartridges and packaging ""from high-potency pineapple- and lemon-flavored cannabis oil concentrate vaporizer cartridges,"" according to the note. More than 3.6 million middle and high school students in the United States have said that they use e-cigarettes, according to the 2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey. Use of any flavored e-cigarette went up among those young users between 2017 and 2018, rising from 60.9% to 67.8%, and menthol use increased from 42.3% to 51.2%, according to the survey. Several states have taken action to prohibit the sale of certain flavored e-cigarette products, in an effort to curb teen vaping, and the US Food and Drug Administration is expected to finalize a policy in the coming weeks that would clear the market of flavored e-cigarettes and vaping products, Trump administration officials have said. The findings in the note are limited to only those high schools in the San Francisco Bay Area, and more research is needed to determine whether similar findings would emerge in other parts of the United States. ""Further research and actions at national, state, and community levels are needed to inform policymaking to reduce youth access to and use of tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, and cannabis products. Youth use of flavored tobacco products, including mint and all other mentholated flavors, is of particular concern,"" Mock and Hendlin wrote in the report. ""Likewise, measures are needed to eliminate environmental contamination from e-cigarette, combustible tobacco product, and cannabis product waste in and around schools,"" they wrote. ""Schools can engage students in garbology projects to identify existing and new use of these products and to raise awareness about their hazardous health and environmental impacts."" Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, a primary care pediatrician and assistant professor of pediatrics at Columbia University in New York, said that she was not surprised by the amount of waste related to both e-cigarette and traditional tobacco products the researchers found at high schools in the Bay Area. ""We know we have an ongoing vaping epidemic in teens and we know that teens who vape are more likely to use other tobacco products in the future,"" Bracho-Sanchez said in an email on Thursday. ""I applaud these researchers for quantifying the extent of the issue in this way since self-reporting surveys have limitations and the sleek, small nature of some of these devices also means they often go unperceived by both teachers and parents,"" she said. She added that she also was not surprised that high schools in lower-income neighborhoods had greater amounts of waste from traditional combustion cigarette products -- ""not only are they more affordable, we know that kids in these neighborhoods are specifically targeted by advertisers,"" she said. The report comes at a time when the United States continues to face an outbreak of lung injuries associated with e-cigarette use or vaping. The specific chemical exposure causing these lung injuries remains unknown, according to the CDC. As of Tuesday, there were 1,299 lung injury cases associated with e-cigarette products in 49 states, the District of Columbia and the US Virgin Islands, according to the CDC. Alaska is the only state without a reported case. About 80% of patients are under 35 years old, and they range in age from 13 to 75 years. States have reported 27 vaping-related deaths.The CDC, US Food and Drug Administration, state and local health departments and other clinical and public health partners are investigating the multistate outbreak.

2018-05-17 00:00:00,2018,5.0,17,FDA Publicly Shames Drug Companies That Block Generic Meds,"Photo:  Dr. Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the FDA testifies during a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing concerning federal efforts to combat the opioid crisis on October 25, 2017 (Getty)Today the Food and Drug Administration published a list of pharmaceutical companies accused of bogging down the development of generic drugs. The makers of brand name drugs are constantly putting up obstacles that delay the development of generic medications, according to generics manufacturers, and this new list calls them out. But it remains to be seen whether major drug companies are capable of shame.Generic drug makers need the cooperation of the brand name manufacturers to acquire samples of the original drug to ensure that the generic is a safe and identical product. This new list, buried at the bottom of an obscure FDA page, lays out the number of complaints major drug companies have had lodged against them by generics manufacturers.Drug companies from the list include big names like Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, and Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Drug maker Celgene tops the list with 13 complaints lodged with the FDA, but the agency doesn’t list which companies made the complaints nor does it really give any detailed information at all.It’s also important to note that many of the companies listed produce both brand name and generic drugs. Mylan, for example, which is listed as having three complaints lodged against it, is primarily a generics maker, yet it became notorious in 2016 after raising the price of its EpiPen allergy drug by 600 percent over the course of a decade.The move to name and shame (words, it should be noted, the FDA doesn’t like to use) is part of President Trump’s larger push to lower consumer drug prices. But it’s unclear that any of the Trump regime’s tactics will put a dent in the prices that Americans pay at the pharmacy. Trump’s head of the FDA, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, said that “branded companies are on notice” in a news conference on Tuesday.Regulating drug prices is basically a non-starter for the Trump White House, and the president’s FDA commissioner is a longtime advocate of allowing drug companies to do whatever the hell they want. In fact, aside from this list, Dr. Gottlieb’s solution to lowering drug prices in the U.S. seems to be getting the rest of the world to actually pay more for their drugs.Gottlieb said on CNBC yesterday that Europeans “do underpay relative to us for branded drugs, and that’s in part because they do put price controls and utilization restrictions on those drugs.” Gottlieb then claimed that Europeans are “overpaying” on generic drugs, an argument that’s disingenuous at best.“That’s not a system for success in the long run,” Gottlieb said about European price controls on drugs. “So, I don’t think they’re set up for long-term success.”That sentiment echoes what President Tump said last week at a White House press conference when he claimed that “foreign, developed nations” are getting a “free-ride by setting drug prices at unfairly low levels, leaving American patients to pay for the innovation that foreign patients enjoy.”Gottlieb, a former fellow at the libertarian think tank American Enterprise Institute, was strangely hailed as a rare bipartisan pick for the FDA when he was first confirmed by the Senate. Gottlieb was confirmed by a vote of 57 to 42. But his financial disclosure forms ares full of names you’ll recognize from the new FDA list. Gottlieb has served on the board of directors for eight different pharmaceutical companies over his career, four of which so recently that he had to give them up to take his new job at the FDA. He has worked as a consultant for some of those companies, like GlaxoSmithKline, the sixth largest pharmaceutical company in the world.A cynic might argue that this new FDA list is purely symbolic because it doesn’t actually set out any reforms or even provide drug companies with information they don’t already know. And that cynic would be right. The Trump regime considers this list to be part of a push for “transparency,” but Americans already know who’s fucking them over. What they need is cheaper drugs.[New York Times | Fierce Healthcare | Ars Technica | CNBC]",https://gizmodo.com/fda-publicly-shames-drug-companies-that-block-generic-m-1826074736,Health,Gizmodo,health,696
2018-02-10 00:00:00,2018,2.0,10,Purdue Pharmaceuticals Says It Will Stop the Aggressive Opioid Marketing That Made It Billions,"Photo: APPurdue Pharmaceuticals, one of the companies which has made billions of dollars selling massive amounts of opioids across the country even as addiction rates and overdose deaths skyrocketed, has announced it will no longer be directly marketing the painkillers to U.S. doctors. Purdue, which the New Yorker dubbed an “Empire of Pain” in a 2017 profile, is the company that developed and released the long-lasting painkiller OxyContin in 1995 and then aggressively marketed it to doctors with campaigns presenting the threat of addiction as overblown. As the New Yorker noted, the painkiller has reportedly made Purdue as much as $35 billion over the years, while doctors and patients alike soon found that its only active ingredient, the semi-synthetic opioid oxycodone, often resulted in “debilitating” withdrawal symptoms upon cessation or even between doses.According to Bloomberg, Purdue is now making significant changes to the way it markets its stable of opioid drugs amid a nearly incontrovertible body of evidence that pharmaceutical companies understated their potential dangers:The company told employees this week that it would cut its sales force by more than half, to 200 workers. It plans to send a letter Monday to doctors saying that its salespeople will no longer come to their clinics to talk about the company’s pain products.“We have restructured and significantly reduced our commercial operation and will no longer be promoting opioids to prescribers,” the company said in a statement. Instead, any questions doctors have will be directed to the Stamford, Connecticut-based company’s medical affairs department....Purdue is credited with helping develop many modern tactics of aggressive pharmaceutical promotion. Its efforts to push OxyContin included OxyContin music, fishing hats, and stuffed plush toys.Research has shown the “the evidence for opioids treating long-term, chronic pain is very weak (despite their effectiveness for short-term, acute pain), while the evidence that opioids cause harm in the long term is very strong,” per Vox.As Bloomberg wrote, having made its $35 billion, Purdue is now positioning “itself as an advocate for fighting the opioid addiction crisis” that it helped create. Bloomberg also noted that one factor in all this might be OxyContin’s growing competition from generic equivalents, which Symphony Health Solutions told the news agency has helped to reduce its 2017 revenue from the drug to $1.7 billion from $2.8 billion five years earlier.While the New York Times estimated some 64,000 people in the U.S. died of drug overdoses in 2016, it doesn’t have data showing which of the overdoses were due to opioids or what kind were involved. But many of the deaths were related to prescription painkillers and a growing number involve one of the many analogs of fentanyl, an extremely powerful and dangerous class of narcotic that is often sold on the black market in lieu of prescription painkillers or mixed with heroin.As Vox noted, research shows that the vast majority of heroin users—and likely thus fentanyl users—started with prescription painkillers. Pharmaceutical companies which manufacture naloxone, a drug that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose, have accordingly raised prices as it came into higher demand.Purdue and its executives paid out over $634 million in settlements over “civil and criminal” allegations related to its marketing techniques in 2007, per Stat, which is fighting in court to unseal records which could shed light on what the company knew as it was pushing OxyContin. At least 14 states are currently fighting other lawsuits against Purdue, according to Reuters, with hundreds of pending suits in Ohio alone.While Purdue’s cessation of direct marketing is likely to at least remove some of the fuel from the raging wildfire that is the opioid epidemic, it’s probably cold news to the friends and loved ones of the tens of thousands of people who have died in the meantime. Stat predicts nearly 500,000 people will die of opioid overdoses in the U.S. over the next decade, with a worst-case death toll forecast at over 650,000.[Bloomberg/Stat]",https://gizmodo.com/purdue-pharmaceuticals-says-it-will-stop-the-aggressive-1822901924,Health,Gizmodo,health,649
2020-01-31 00:00:00,2020,1.0,31,Coronavirus: Why it takes at least a year to make a vaccine,"U.S. and international health officials are speeding work to create a vaccine for the deadly coronavirus spreading throughout Asia, which has already outpaced the 2003 SARS epidemic and killed at least 213 people in China. Researchers will need to work fast. Since the first patient was identified in Wuhan on Dec. 31, the number of coronavirus cases has mushroomed to nearly 10,000 in mainland China alone as of Friday morning, up from roughly 800 the week before. While the new virus appears to be less deadly than the 2003 SARS outbreak, which sickened 8,098 people and killed almost 800, it is spreading significantly faster. Hopes to get a vaccine to market are high, but doctors want expectations to be low for how quickly it can happen. Developing, testing and reviewing any potential vaccine is a long, complex and expensive endeavor that could take months or even years, global health experts say. It took drugmakers more than a year to create a potential vaccine for the SARS epidemic, which was identified in November 2002 and killed nearly 800 people worldwide. By the time one was ready for human trials, the virus was pretty well contained. Since 2004, there have not been any known reported cases of SARS, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. U.S. health officials are fast-tracking work on a coronavirus vaccine, hoping to start human trials within the next three months. Even so, the fastest researchers could get a vaccine for the current outbreak to market would be a year, said Peter Hotez, co-director of Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, who helped develop a vaccine candidate for SARS. And that's assuming a best-case scenario where researchers immediately find something that works, the animal trials confirm it works and there are no complications in human trials. ""The problem is each vaccine is different. It's not like you can snap your fingers and make a treatment,"" Hotez said in a phone interview. Before researchers can begin human trials, they must first have a firm understanding of the pathogen. Scientists are in the early stages of understanding the novel coronavirus but they do know its most important molecule is a spike protein, a multifunctional mechanism that allows the virus to enter the host, said Dr. Maria Bottazzi, co-director of Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development. ""In the coronavirus — both the original SARS virus and Wuhan virus — it's called the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein,"" she said. ""We, therefore, [would] use that as our ideal vaccine candidate."" The next step is a preclinical toxicology study that assesses whether a drug is safe to use and is tested on animals, Bottazzi said. That usually takes three to six months depending on the study's design, she said. If the evaluation is successful, scientists will then look to begin the first human trials, also known as phase 1 clinical trials, Bottazzi said. ""Those are usually done in normal, adult, healthy volunteers,"" she said. ""It generally doesn't take more than maybe 20 or 30 people."" However, even if the scientists successfully get to an early stage trial, they could run into roadblocks during the vaccine development process that could extend the timeline for deployment. Bottazzi said there will likely be regulatory or operational obstacles, such as finding enough human volunteers. Then there are, of course, economic and financial hurdles, she said. ""What kind of business model? Who is going to pick up the cost?"" she said. ""Developing biologics can cost hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars."" Hotez said he ran into a funding roadblock when developing a vaccine candidate for SARS in 2011. The level of investor interest had been ""remarkably little,"" he recalled, because the SARS epidemic was no longer a huge problem. This is an issue with the system, he said. But thanks to SARS and success with the Ebola outbreak, some public health experts believe we could have a vaccine for the novel virus sooner than expected. ""We may have a vaccine in record time,"" former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said. Lawrence Gostin, a professor and faculty director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, said due to the advancements in science, it wouldn't surprise him to have a vaccine in hand within a few months. ""We are light years beyond where we were in biomedical technology than during SARS,"" he said. ""The world has changed and all for the better."" There are currently no proven therapies for the latest outbreak, which authorities believe originated from a seafood market in China. Hong Kong researchers claimed Tuesday they have already developed a vaccine for the virus but warned that it will ""take months"" to test the vaccine on animals and another year to conduct trials on humans before it is ready. While U.S. officials hope to start human trials on a vaccine in as little as three months, that timeline is optimistic, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. It could take a year or more before a vaccine is ready for sale to the public, he told reporters on a call Tuesday, adding that a phase 1 trial also does not mean ""you have a vaccine that's ready for deployment."" The National Institutes of Health is working with biotech company Moderna to develop a vaccine using the current strain of the coronavirus, Fauci said. ""It will take three months to get it into the trial, three months to get safety, immunogenicity data,"" Fauci said. ""Then you move into phase 2. What we do from that point on will be determined by what has happened with the outbreak over those months."" Scientists are also looking at the 2003 outbreak of SARS, Fauci said, adding that ""there could be some cross-reactivity"" between the SARS virus and the new coronavirus ""that could be utilized."" In addition to Moderna, at least a dozen drug companies, including Johnson & Johnson, are working to create a potential vaccine. Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J's chief scientific officer, told CNBC earlier this week that the drugmaker could create a vaccine in the coming months to fight against the fast-spreading virus. But he added it could take up to a year to bring it to market. In the meantime, local authorities in China are using Gilead Sciences' antiviral drug Remdesivir, which was tested as a possible treatment during the Ebola outbreak, U.S. health officials said on the call Tuesday. Some authorities are also using antiviral drug Kaletra, developed by drugmaker AbbVie, on a ""compassionate basis.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/coronavirus-why-it-takes-at-least-a-year-to-make-a-vaccine.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,1105
2018-03-01 00:00:00,2018,3.0,1,Nigeria reaches record high with 72 dead from Lassa fever,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)Nigeria is facing its worst Lassa fever outbreak on record, with 72 people confirmed to be dead from the virus and 317 infected, according to the World Health Organization. A further 764 are suspected to be infected, and 2,845 contacts have been identified. On average, Lassa fever is deadly in 1% of all individuals infected, with higher rates of 15% morbidity among people hospitalized for the illness. As of Sunday, the case fatality ratio was 22%, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. Although it's endemic to the country, Lassa fever numbers have never reached this proportion before, according to the WHO. Nigeria's Centre for Disease Control said Wednesday that it was facing an ""unprecedented outbreak"" that has spread to 18 states since it began in January. The disease can cause fever and hemorrhaging of various parts of the body -- including the eyes and nose -- and can be spread through contact with an infected rat.  Person-to-person transmission is low but has been seen in Nigerian hospital settings this year. Fourteen health workers were infected, of whom four died within eight weeks. The WHO said Wednesday that health facilities were overstretched in the southern states of Edo, Ondo and Ebonyi, and it is working with national reference hospitals and the Alliance for International Medical Action to rapidly expand and better equip treatment centers. It also hopes to reduce further infections to hospital staff. ""The ability to rapidly detect cases of infection in the community and refer them early for treatment improves patients' chances of survival and is critical to this response,"" said Dr. Wondimagegnehu Alemu, the WHO representative to Nigeria. State health authorities are mobilizing doctors and nurses to work in treatment centers. Four UK researchers have also been deployed to Nigeria to help control the unusually large outbreak.  ""Given the large number of states affected, many people will seek treatment in health facilities that are not appropriately prepared to care for Lassa fever,"" Alemu said. ""The risk of infection to health care workers is likely to increase."" Lassa fever is endemic in most of West Africa, especially Nigeria, where it was discovered in 1969. Edo, Ondo and Ebonyi states account for 85% of cases, said Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, director of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, in a statement. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, touching, eating or sniffing foods and other household items that have been contaminated by multimammate rat feces or urine can aid transmission. Nigerians, especially in those three states, should ""continue focusing on prevention by ensuring they prevent access to their foodstuff by rodents,"" Ihekweazu said. There is risk of the virus spreading to other West African countries due to increased migration, said Dr. Oyewale Tomori, professor of virology at Redeemer's University in Nigeria and the former regional virologist for the WHO's Africa Region. ""There is always cause for alarm in West Africa, where the rodent host of can be found in virtually all countries of West Africa,"" he said. Benin, Liberia and Sierra Leone have all reported cases of Lassa fever over the past month, according to the WHO, but risk of further international transmission is low for now.

2018-07-30 17:12:58,2018,7.0,30,"Vaginal ‘Rejuvenation’ Treatments May Be Unsafe, the F.D.A. Says","WASHINGTON — The Food and Drug Administration on Monday announced that it had warned several companies to stop marketing laser devices for procedures billed as “vaginal rejuvenation,” saying they were dangerous and deceptive treatments. The agency originally permitted the lasers and related energy-based devices onto the market for treatment of serious conditions, like cancer, genital warts, or surgery including hysterectomies. But in recent years, manufacturers have been heavily promoting the lasers for symptoms related to vaginal atrophy, menopause, urinary incontinence and sexual function. Cosmetic, spa treatments using laser and other products for vaginal health have also become popular among younger women. Some treatments use the devices to destroy or reshape vaginal tissue, which the manufacturers say can solve some problems related to dryness or other ailments. The F.D.A. disagrees. But even though the agency originally approved the devices for certain treatments, it is legal for doctors to use them for off-label conditions. The agency noted in one letter that a manufacturer, BTL Industries, was marketing a radio-frequency device, Exilis Ultra 360, as a new approach to “women’s intimate health” even though the product had only been approved by the F.D.A. for uses in dermatology like wrinkle treatment, including the eyelids. The F.D.A. described the company’s “pelvic-suite” web page, where the device was advertised as able to build collagen and elasticity for “female intimate parts,” and requested that the company furnish documentation that it had been cleared to market the product for such uses. The agency posted copies of letters it sent to manufacturers of the MonaLisa Touch, Femilift, Venus Fiore System and other devices, telling them not to promote the devices for the rejuvenation procedure. “These products have serious risks and don’t have adequate evidence to support their use for these purposes,” said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the F.D.A. commissioner. “We are deeply concerned women are being harmed.” Dr. Gottlieb also said he was concerned that deceptive marketing of these devices might prevent some patients from getting appropriate therapies for severe medical conditions. The F.D.A. said the full extent of the risks is unknown, but that the agency has found cases of vaginal burns, scarring, and lasting pain following the treatments. The agency has received 14 reports of adverse events related to the treatments, including burning sensations and significant pain. The companies targeted by the F.D.A. were Inmode; Sciton; Alma Lasers; Thermigen; BTL Aesthetics, BTL Industries; Venus Concept and Cynosure. Some companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Jane G. Mazur, a spokeswoman for Hologic, Inc. whose subsidiary sells the MonaLisa Touch, said they were reviewing the F.D.A. notice. “We are evaluating the letter in full and will collaborate with the agency to ensure all product communications adhere to regulatory requirements,” Ms. Mazur said. Domenic DiSisto, general counsel for Venus Concept, said the Venus Fiore device is not currently marketed or sold in the United States, and that the company had modified its website. The F.D.A.’s letters are considered a step short of a formal warning. The manufacturers are asked to provide details on the product and on what basis they are assuming approval. The agency has been under pressure to speed up approval of medical devices. Critics have said that the F.D.A. device approvals are already going too fast and happening with insufficient oversight. In the announcement Monday, Dr. Gottlieb said the agency would strengthen its studies of devices after they have been approved for sale. No federal agency or medical society has figures for the amount of these procedures done every year, but a casual search through gynecology practices shows they are becoming prevalent — despite opposition from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The medical society has issued several statements noting that the devices, including the MonaLisa Touch, do not have F.D.A. clearance or approval for treatment of menopausal symptoms, as advertised. “Obstetrician-gynecologists should be cognizant of the evidence regarding innovative practices” and should be wary “of adopting new or innovative approaches on the basis of promotions or marketing,” the college said. Dr. Cheryl B. Iglesia, director of the section of female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, said the laser technology held promise, but that more study was needed to understand the safety as well as which patients the devices might help. “I think the F.D.A. is trying to be conservative,” she said. “They do not want the marketing to be ahead of the science on this.” But some doctors already say the devices work well for their off-label use. In a testimonial on its website, Alma Laser featured a video of Dr. Leslie Apgar, a Maryland gynecologist, who said she was pleased with the Femilift, as well as the company’s assistance with marketing. “With Alma I was able to get the Femilift system that I wanted, along with the marketing solution that included a new website fully optimized for Google and all the other search engines,” Dr. Apgar said in the video. “It has worked out extremely well for me, as I have gotten new patients weekly directed to my practice.” An earlier version of this article, using information from the Food and Drug Administration, misidentified the manufacturer of a device marketed for vaginal rejuvenation. The manufacturer of the device is Venus Concept, not BTL Aesthetics, a subsidiary of BTL Industries. The article also misstated the name of the device; it is the Venus Fiore System, not the Venus Fiore RF Ablation System.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/health/vaginal-laser-fda.html,health,The New York Times,health,904

2018-04-04 00:00:00,2018,4.0,4,"Cycling tied to urinary infections, but also better sex","(Reuters Health) - Female cyclists may be more likely to develop saddle sores and urinary infections than runners and swimmers, a recent study suggests. But the survey of female athletes also found those who participated in high-intensity rides and covered more total miles reported better sexual function than runners or swimmers. This contradicts some previous smaller studies that have linked cycling to sexual dysfunction in women, said lead study author Thomas Gaither of the University of California, San Francisco. Gaither’s team surveyed 3,118 women who belonged to major cycling, swimming, and running organizations in the U.S., Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Most were white, under age 40, single and normal weight. Overall, 34 percent were runners or swimmers. About 13 percent were considered “high-intensity” cyclists because they had cycled for two or more years and rode their bikes more than three times weekly, averaging more than 25 miles each time. Another 53 percent were classified as “low-intensity” cyclists who were newer to the sport or who rode less often or took shorter rides. More than 80 percent of the study participants were sexually active – but more cyclists in both the high- and low-intensity groups were sexually active than non-cyclists. High-intensity cyclists were 30 percent less likely to report sexual dysfunction, compared to runners and swimmers who were non-cyclists, researchers report in the Journal of Sexual Medicine. There were no differences in urinary symptoms between cyclists and noncyclists, although cyclists were more likely to have had a urinary tract infection (UTI) in the past. The results also confirmed an association between cycling and genital numbness and saddle sores. The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how cycling might influence whether women develop gynecological problems or sexual dysfunction. Saddle sores or numbness might develop when nerves that run across the perineum toward the genitals get compressed during longer or more intense rides, Gaither said by email. Standing while riding was associated with less numbness, he noted, and more total lifetime miles was associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing numbness at some point in time. “It is important to point out that our controls were runners and swimmers so we don’t believe it is exercise in and of itself that is a cause for this association,” Gaither said. On the other hand, because the study only included athletes, it’s also not clear if the findings apply equally to people who are physically less active. “In an era where cycling has become an increasingly popular modality for exercise, transport, and leisure activity . . . we found that cycling did not negatively impact sexual or urinary function,” Gaither and colleagues concluded. “However, cycling was strongly associated with both genital numbness and saddle sores, and modestly associated with UTIs. These associations deserve further inquiry.” They add, “Increasing the time standing out of the saddle was associated with lower odds of self-reported genital numbness.

2017-01-23 16:57:00,2017,1.0,23,Could Your Kids Inherit Your Hypochondria?," ""I feel dizzy. It's an aneurysm! I can feel it!"" I remember my sister whispering those words from the twin bed a few feet away late one night when she was seven or eight. I sunk under the covers to protect myself and my dolly from the imminent explosion of blood and brain matter that she stated would soon cover the room, but woke up the next morning to find her skull remarkably intact. It wasn't an aneurysm—or the brain tumor she had identified as a viable back-up option. And the mild cough she'd picked up at school the week before wasn't pleurisy or a sign of a collapsed lung. And the weekly bouts of appendicitis she's continued to experience for the past 35 years have, miraculously, never resulted in surgery.  My sister has hypochondria, or—as the condition has been rebranded in the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—""Illness Anxiety Disorder"" (IAD). I, on the other hand, regularly share potentially germy beverages with family and friends, frequently purchase chewing gum packed with controversial artificial sweeteners, and often eat food off the floor regardless of the five-second rule. When a ""helpful"" stranger came up to me when I was nine months pregnant and let me know that the first case of Zika virus had been identified in Los Angeles County, where I live, I simply replied: ""Cool. Thanks.""  My sister and I grew up in the same home and were born less than three years apart. So why is she constantly scanning her body for signs of scurvy while I've always wanted to work in a hospital to be closer to illness and death because I feel most at ease when surrounded by crisis? We were raised with two extremely anxious parents, but neither of them were hypochondriacs.   An estimated 75 to 85 percent of people with hypochondria also suffer from anxiety, depression, or another psychological condition. Passing on IAD is more about passing on anxiety in general than it is about passing on anxiety that's specifically related to health concerns, says clinical psychologist Michael Brustein.  ""People with [hypochondria] often have a history where one or both of their significant caretakers have anxiety. It doesn't have to necessarily be [hypochondria]…Regardless of their specific history, they develop a core belief that the world is a fragile place and that something bad is lurking. There is often a belief, sometimes unconscious, that if they worry about something enough they can control and protect themselves,"" he says.  My sister says that her deep-seated fear of illness is one of the reasons she chose not to have children. ""I'm so paranoid about all of the sicknesses they could get,"" she says. I sometimes wonder how her hypochondria developed and if either of our parents' anxiety impacted her lifelong preoccupation with illness.  ""I know our mother's and grandmother's obsessions with food going bad, or as they called it 'spoilage,' haunts me to this day,"" she says. ""They made me feel like food wasn't safe, and if food wasn't safe, how could anything be safe? I still throw out perfectly good food because of it. I hate buffets to this day because Mom said they breed germs. I feel like sickness is lurking there and if I eat anything I could be in the hospital by midnight.""  Recent statistics estimate that between 1 and 5 percent of Americans experience Illness Anxiety Disorder, but hard numbers on childhood hypochondria are especially difficult to identify since it's the caregivers who are ultimately making the decision to seek medical treatment. When caregivers are in charge of triage, it's their own level of health sensitivity that matters most.   Parenting blogger and lifelong, self-proclaimed hypochondriac Kathleen Dennehy is convinced her four-year-old's health anxiety is a direct result of her own illness obsession. Dennehy was convinced she had polio at an early age and regularly fantasized about how she'd cope with her imminent paralysis. Now, her daughter drags herself around by her arms at bedtime exclaiming, ""My legs just don't work!"" A recent cut on her finger resulted in the proclamation, ""I need a whole new arm now! I need medicine!""  While there's hard scientific evidence that anxiety can be passed on both genetically and through children mimicking their parents' behaviors, Dennehy says her own mother was the opposite of a hypochondriac.  ""My mom was a sickness denier. Her mom was a nurse and always sick or fearing sickness. My mom grew up always being dragged to doctors, so when we were growing up, she dragged us to school no matter what, even with pneumonia and appendicitis. We only went to hospitals and doctors when we fainted or began hemorrhaging. So I think my hypochondria was also a reaction to my mom's seeming indifference to our real or imagined medical needs,"" she says.  Many people told me that my own lack of health anxiety would go out the window when I had a baby of my own. While I admittedly spent the first week of my son's life staring at him with arms outstretched like a spotter ready to flick away any germ or speck of dust or errant asteroid, that quickly faded. We eat off the floor together now. I let the dog wash his face. I tried to stop him from putting my iPhone in his mouth for a while because it's both absolutely filthy and emits radiofrequency waves. Then I realized letting him suck on it kept him fully entertained long enough to afford me the essential two minutes of daily mom time that it takes me to brush my hair and put on clean underwear and I just let him do it.  I do have lifelong anxiety of my own, though, and have seen extensive evidence that I've inherited symptoms of my father's combat PTSD. So if the theory that any anxiety disorder can lead to childhood hypochondria holds true, my son could be diagnosing himself with bubonic plague before he hits preschool.

2016-07-08 00:00:00,2016,7.0,8,How having kids can ruin your romantic relationship,"Lots of women look forward to motherhood -- getting to know a tiny baby, raising a growing child, developing a relationship with a maturing son or daughter. All over the world, people believe that parenting is the most rewarding part of life. And it's good that so many mothers treasure that bond with their child, because the transition to parenthood causes profound changes in a woman's marriage and her overall happiness... and not for the better. Families usually welcome a baby to the mix with great expectations. But as a mother's bond with a child grows, it's likely that her other relationships are deteriorating. I surveyed decades of studies on the psychological effects of having a child to write my book ""Great Myths of Intimate Relationships: Dating, Sex, and Marriage,"" and here's what the research literature shows. Nowhere to go but down? When people marry, they're usually in love and happy to be tying the knot. But after that, things tend to change. On average, couples' satisfaction with their marriage declines during the first years of marriage and, if the decline is particularly steep, divorce may follow. The course of true love runs downhill. And that's before you factor in what happens when it's time to start buying a carseat and diapers. Wedding bells or single again: psychology predicts where your relationship is headed For around 30 years, researchers have studied how having children affects a marriage, and the results are conclusive: the relationship between spouses suffers once kids come along. Comparing couples with and without children, researchers found that the rate of the decline in relationship satisfaction is nearly twice as steep for couples who have children than for childless couples. In the event that a pregnancy is unplanned, the parents experience even greater negative impacts on their relationship. The irony is that even as the marital satisfaction of new parents declines, the likelihood of them divorcing also declines. So, having children may make you miserable, but you'll be miserable together. Worse still, this decrease in marital satisfaction likely leads to a change in general happiness, because the biggest predictor of overall life satisfaction is one's satisfaction with their spouse. While the negative marital impact of becoming parents is familiar to fathers and mothers, it is especially insidious because so many young couples think that having children will bring them closer together or at least will not lead to marital distress. Yet, this belief, that having children will improve one's marriage, is a tenacious and persistent myth among those who are young and in love. Lovers morph into parents It seems obvious that adding a baby to a household is going to change its dynamics. And indeed, the arrival of children changes how couples interact. Parents often become more distant and businesslike with each other as they attend to the details of parenting. Mundane basics like keeping kids fed, bathed and clothed take energy, time and resolve. In the effort to keep the family running smoothly, parents discuss carpool pickups and grocery runs, instead of sharing the latest gossip or their thoughts on presidential elections. Questions about one's day are replaced with questions about whether this diaper looks full. These changes can be profound. Fundamental identities may shift -- from wife to mother, or, at a more intimate level, from lovers to parents. Even in same-sex couples, the arrival of children predicts less relationship satisfaction and sex. Beyond sexual intimacy, new parents tend to stop saying and doing the little things that please their spouses. Flirty texts are replaced with messages that read like a grocery receipt. As gatekeepers, moms hold keys to shared parenting duties With nearly half of all births being to unmarried couples (PDF), some parents may think they have gamed the system by skipping the wedding. Not so. The relationship burden of having children is present regardless of marital status, gender orientation or level of income. In addition, the adverse impact of becoming a parent is found in other countries, including those with greater rates of nonmarital parenting and more generous family policies. Moms bear the brunt Not surprisingly, it is mothers, not fathers, who bear the heaviest cost of becoming parents. Even when both parents work outside the home and even in marriages in which both spouses describe themselves as sharing the burden of household chores, most parents slide toward gender-stereotypical ways of parenting. Women are more likely to become the ""on call"" parent, the one who gets up in the night to bring a child a tissue or who's called by the school nurse. As part of this pattern, new mothers tend to cut their hours in outside work, which often leads fathers to feel more of the burden of financial responsibility. A common pattern emerges in which dads start spending more time and energy on outside work and moms start doing an increasing percentage of the childcare and housework. Cue the feelings of frustration, guilt and distress for both parents. The new battleground for same-sex couples is equal rights for their kids New mothers often talk about their social isolation, becoming disconnected from friends and colleagues and how their world feels like it's shrinking. All of these changes lead to fundamental and long-lasting effects on new mothers' circle of support, including with their spouses. The consequences of the relationship strain can be serious. Marital stress is associated with many serious physical health problems as well as symptoms of depression and other mental health problems. The link between psychological and marital problems is strong enough that researchers have found that couples therapy is one of the most effective ways of treating depression and some other mental illnesses. A light at the end of the tunnel? If the arrival of children is hard on marriages, is the departure of children good for marriages? Some marriages do improve once the children leave the nest. In other cases, the successful launch of the children leads spouses to discover they have few shared interests and there's nothing keeping them together. These downsides to having children may partly explain why more and more women in the United States and around the world are choosing not to procreate. According to the U.S. Census, the percent of childless American women (ages 15-44) increased a staggering amount in just two generations: from 35 percent in 1976 to 47 percent in 2010. Despite the dismal picture of motherhood painted by researchers like me (sorry Mom), most mothers (and fathers) rate parenting as their greatest joy. Much like childbirth, where nearly all mothers believe the pain and suffering was worth it, most mothers believe the rewards of watching their children grow up is worth the cost to their romantic relationships.

2017-11-03 00:00:00,2017,11.0,3,Millions either malnourished or obese in global nutrition crisis,"LONDON (Reuters) - Almost every country in the world now has serious nutrition problems, either due to over-eating leading to obesity or a lack of food leading to undernutrition, according to a major study published on Saturday. Researchers behind the Global Nutrition Report, which looked at 140 countries, said the problems were “putting the brakes on human development as a whole” and called for a critical change in the response to this global health threat. The report found that while malnutrition rates are falling globally, their rate of decrease is not fast enough to meet the internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to end all forms of malnutrition by 2030. More than 155 million children aged under five are stunted due to lack of nutrition, and 52 million are defined as “wasted” - meaning they do not weigh enough for their height, the report said. At the other end of the spectrum, over-eating is taking a heavy toll on people of all ages worldwide: the report found that two billion of the world’s seven billion people are now overweight or obese. In North America, a third of all men and women are obese. Worldwide, at least 41 million children under five are overweight, and in Africa alone, some 10 million children are now classified as overweight. “Historically, maternal anaemia and child undernutrition have been seen as separate problems to obesity and non-communicable diseases,” said Jessica Fanzo, a professor at Johns Hopkins University in the United States who co-led the Global Nutrition Report. “The reality is they are intimately connected and driven by inequalities everywhere in the world. That’s why governments ... need to tackle them holistically, not as distinct problems.” Donor funding for nutrition rose by just 2 percent to $867 million in 2015, the report found. It said funding needs to be “turbo charged” and called for a tripling of global investment in nutrition to $70 billion over 10 years. The Global Nutrition Report is an independently produced annual analysis of the state of the world’s nutrition. It tracks progress on targets for maternal, infant and young child nutrition and on diet-related chronic diseases adopted by World Health Organization member states.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Thursday it has confirmed 138 cases of E. coli in 25 states, with the most recent one occurring on December 1. That means consumers should continue avoiding romaine lettuce from Salinas, California -- where investigations have found a common grower.  If the location of the romaine lettuce isn't listed, the CDC still warns consumers to avoid it, even if they're at a restaurant.  Romaine lettuce from places outside of Salinas, however, are OK to consume, the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration say. Of the 138 total cases, 72 have resulted in hospitalizations, with 13 people developing kidney failure, the CDC reported. No deaths have been reported. This outbreak is caused by the same strain in the outbreaks linked to leafy greens in 2017 and to romaine lettuce in 2018, the CDC said.

Like the original, the updated Tovala oven steams, bakes, toasts, and broils food, and while it can cook whatever you put inside, the company would recommend users subscribe to its $12 proprietary meal service The oven looks different, but the really big change is the introduction of three sets of physical controls: the top is for choosing the baking mode or seeing what step the meal is on; the middle tells you the temperature the oven is at and allows you to preset it; and the bottom tells the time left for cooking. Although the oven relies on Wi-Fi to pull information about the prepackaged Tovala meals, users can still operate the oven and its buttons without a connection. The new oven also weighs significantly less: 19 pounds versus the first generation’s 31 pounds. It can still hold four pre-packaged meals, which is how the company describes the oven’s cooking space. Unlike other systems, the Tovala also doesn’t claim to use AI or machine learning to identify food and when it’s done cooking. One meal is one serving, and to cook them, you scan a QR code on their packaging through the oven’s built-in scanner. The meals are specifically designed to cook properly in 20 minutes or less. The redesign comes with an increased price of $349 over the prior model’s $299, even though it doesn’t include new functionality. While other smart ovens have entered the market, like Brava and the second-generation June, none of them steam food like Tovala. Brava and June have a full accessories market for their ovens, including air fryer baskets and meat thermometers, whereas Tovala says it has no interest, at least not right now. The company doesn’t see its customers as wanting to fiddle around with extra parts, the team tells me. Ultimately, the smart oven market seems to be maturing with both June and Tovala launching the second generation of their devices in the past year. Tovala is betting its meal plan is going to be the key to its success, while June seems to think people want to cook their own food, just with the guarantee it won’t burn. Maybe there’s a market for all of them.",https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/13/18089594/tovala-launches-a-lighter-redesigned-second-generation-smart-oven,Tech,The Verge,technology,387
2016-05-20 09:00:00,2016,5.0,20,A Japanese Monk Is Making a VR World to Reflect the True Feudal Tokyo,"In 1603, Japan severed diplomatic relations with the rest of the world and effectively became a hermit kingdom. The period from 1603 to 1868 was known as the Edo Period, and is often portrayed in film in other media. A Buddhist monk turned tech entrepreneur wants to bring this back to reality—or rather virtual reality—with his project EDO VR. ""The Edo period was a very unique period in Japanese history, yet there's not much visual evidence from this period,"" Oishi Shinkyo told me over the phone. ""I really want people from the present to learn about this period while having fun."" Shinkyo is collaborating with art historian Nobuo Nakamura to recreate a famous street that stretches from one area of Tokyo (Nihonbashi) to another (Kanda) based off of a famous Japanese handscroll artwork called the Kidai Shoran. In the preliminary mockup, you can see traditional streets and buildings crisscrossed with people from the Japan of old. They took the Kidai Shoran as a reference point due to its scope. ""Woodblock prints only depict one scene, but this artwork shows the whole street view,"" said Shinkyo. ""It's a bit like a Google street map from the past."" Shinkyo, who was born into the life of a Buddhist monk, studied at Ryukoku University—originally founded just for Buddhist monks—before entering the IT sector. He spent a few years working with tech companies making gaming apps before setting up his own virtual reality startup AVATRA six months ago to focus on his project of recreating feudal Tokyo in VR. Shinkyo is still working as a part-time monk. Through making this VR world, Shinkyo explained that he wanted to provide a more authentic portrayal of Edo Japan than the average viewer might have observed through mainstream Japanese period dramas and films. ""Those programmes sometimes recreate a fantasy version of Edo Japan by including elements that didn't actually exist in the past,"" said Shinkyo, citing epic group fight scenes between samurais as an example. ""There are a lot of gaps in people's knowledge with regards to this historical period—it was actually a really peaceful time, for example."" While the project is just getting started, Shinkyo wants people to get a sense of what has and hasn't changed in Tokyo. As an example, he noted that certain street names remained unchanged in the present even though massive skyscrapers now stand where once there may have been a wooden shack. Ultimately, Shinkyo wants to turn his version of VR Tokyo into a gaming world, and also envisions applications in museums and classrooms so that kids can receive a more hands-on history lesson. ""We're just crowdfunding so we can recreate sections of Edo Tokyo in VR at the moment, and it's trial and error at this stage, but after that we want to do a game project that either contains a narrative or that focuses on specific events in sections of Tokyo,"" added Shinkyo.

2017-05-13 00:00:00,2017,5.0,13,"Adidas Yeezy collectors, sneakerheads are turning to bots","Randy* still remembers buying his first pair of real sneakers, the Air Jordan 13 Flint. Ever since then, he's been a sneakerhead. Being a collector while growing up in south Florida wasn't easy. Randy couldn't easily get to a bigger city to buy sneakers in-store, so he was stuck buying online. But he was too slow, and he always lost out. Eventually he started using browser extensions that would put sneakers in his online cart the second they went on sale. Then he hit the goldmine: bots. ""It's like putting a Lambo next to a Toyota Corolla,"" Randy said, comparing bots and extensions. ""A bot was quicker. It would do everything, add to cart and check out. You could set up information and put your credit card info in."" Eventually Randy quit his day job at the batting cage for a more lucrative career of reselling sneakers. Take the much-desired Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2, Kanye West's sneaker. If you were lucky enough to grab a pair of the Zebra colorway at retail, you'd pay $220 plus tax. At sneaker consignment store Flight Club, it's between $1,250 to $2,500 a pair. Ebay has a pair for $1,750. And at on sneaker stock market site StockX, the 52 week high was $3,072 a pair. ""I do feel bad, but I don't mind reselling,"" Randy explained. ""It sucks because as a collector, you want to have the shoe and not pay overprice for it. But, at the same time, it's a hustle. People are out here flipping shoes. That is literally their job."" ""People are doing a lot worse things out here,"" he added. ""I'd rather sell shoes than sell drugs."" In-store limited edition sneaker releases usually go to bigger cities like New York or Atlanta, where sneaker culture is more prevalent. If you're willing to spend four days in waiting in line, maybe you'll be lucky, but even then you''re not guaranteed to get a pair in your size. If you don't want the hassle, you can buy a pair online from a third-party seller. But unless you're willing to pay top dollar to someone reputable, there's a good chance of getting stuck with a counterfeit pair. Remember those Flint 13s Randy bought? He sold them to buy Air Jordan Cool Grey 11s. When he received them, he found out they were fake. Or, you can buy a bot. AIY Expert Solutions is a company with employees in Australia, Lebanon and Nigeria that sells sneaker bots like AIO Bot and Another Nike Bot for about $325. More than 40 employees run the bots, providing tutorials, customer support and up-to-date software engineering. Some people claim bots are unfair because they allow technology to beat out humans for products. But people just want an honest shot at getting limited edition sneakers, AIY Expert Solutions vice president Alex* explained. If everyone has their own bot, it levels the playing field. He notes that even in-store sales are often unfair because retail workers can ""hide"" shoes for friends or for a side profit. ""It was never easy,"" Alex explained. ""The Big Yeezy [Kanye West] promised everyone we would have some. It's been four years! Might as well have gone for the lotto.""AIY Expert Solutions has sold tens of thousands of bots to date, according to Alex. On average, each bot has only purchased about 2.5 pairs of Yeezys. Some people do buy 50 bots then and buy 300 to 400 pairs at a time, but those few-and-far-between professionals are ""edge-case users"" who do not represent the majority. Most bot owners just want a couple rare pairs. ""That's not something that's going to kill the community like one person buying 3,000 pairs will,"" he said. ""I get resellers, but I think everyone should have a fighting chance against resellers."" Bots also make it easier and safer for everyone, argues John*, who runs a sneaker reselling service called RSVP Kingz. Because there is such a demand for some sneakers, it can get dangerous. Two people were shot in last year in Minneapolis over Nike Air Jordan 2 Retro Wing It shoes, according to the New York Daily News. The store only had 10 pairs for sale. A Houston man was murdered over three pairs of Air Jordans, the Houston Chronicle reported. A 14-year-old boy allegedly shot another teen for cutting in a line to buy Yeezys in Brooklyn, NBC New York said. To be completely fair, these cases are rare but people don't want to deal with the hassle. ""I don't want the drama that goes on in-store with riots,"" John said. RSVP Kingz uses its own proprietary bots to buy sneakers on behalf of its customers, who pay a fee for the service. Costs vary depending on the sneaker, with the most expensive Yeezys demanding up to $300 plus retail costs per pair. If the service is not able to get a pair, you get your money back. ""It's much easier,"" John said. ""You don't have to do anything yourself. You don't have to go in store. If you are at home, you don't even have to press anything on your computer."" John, who is a currently studying computer science in college, got into the sneaker reselling business after seeing his friends get rich from sneakers. He's a sneakerhead himself. He owns 40 to 50 pairs of Yeezys in various patterns for his own personal wear. His personal favorite is the Beluga colorway. RSVP Kingz was able to secure 1,800 pairs for its customers, he claims. Because he is providing a service, John feels justified in what he does. It's cheaper than buying shoes on the open market, and you're sure it's the real thing. Bots are difficult to run and expensive to maintain, Randy adds. You'll need to know how to code your bot, as well as purchase proxy servers and other maintenance costs. However, Randy has since quit the sneaker game and now makes money creating YouTube videos about, you guessed it, sneakers. Or, you can continue to try your luck. One of AIY Expert Solutions' members was at a thrift store in Lebanon sifting through pairs of sneakers when he found a pair of Air Jordan 1 Retro Royals. They think someone off-loaded a bunch of sneakers in the U.S., and the black and blue pair, which retail for $1,000 for a used pair on Flight Club, managed to make its way to the country. ""He's been wearing them for the last two years,"" Alex said laughing. * All names were changed for privacy.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/13/adidas-yeezy-collectors-sneakerheads-using-bots.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,1091
2020-03-23 15:00:15,2020,3.0,23,"There Is a Racial Divide in Speech-Recognition Systems, Researchers Say","Technology from Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM and Microsoft misidentified 35 percent of words from people who were black. White people fared much better. SAN FRANCISCO — With an iPhone, you can dictate a text message. Put Amazon’s Alexa on your coffee table, and you can request a song from across the room. But these devices may understand some voices better than others. Speech recognition systems from five of the world’s biggest tech companies — Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM and Microsoft — make far fewer errors with users who are white than with users who are black, according to a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The systems misidentified words about 19 percent of the time with white people. With black people, mistakes jumped to 35 percent. About 2 percent of audio snippets from white people were considered unreadable by these systems, according to the study, which was conducted by researchers at Stanford University. That rose to 20 percent with black people.

	 The study, which took an unusually comprehensive approach to measuring bias in speech recognition systems, offers another cautionary sign for A.I. technologies rapidly moving into everyday life. Other studies have shown that as facial recognition systems move into police departments and other government agencies, they can be far less accurate when trying to identify women and people of color. Separate tests have uncovered sexist and racist behavior in “chatbots,” translation services, and other systems designed to process and mimic written and spoken language. “I don’t understand why there is not more due diligence from these companies before these technologies are released,” said Ravi Shroff, a professor of statistics at New York University who explores bias and discrimination in new technologies. “I don’t understand why we keep seeing these problems.” All these systems learn by analyzing vast amounts of data. Facial recognition systems, for instance, learn by identifying patterns in thousands of digital images of faces. In many cases, the systems mimic the biases they find in the data, similar to children picking up bad habits from their parents. Chatbots, for example, learn by analyzing reams of human dialogue. If this dialogue associates women with housework and men with C.E.O. jobs, the chatbots will do the same. The Stanford study indicated that leading speech recognition systems could be flawed because companies are training the technology on data that is not as diverse as it could be — learning their task mostly from white people, and relatively few black people. 
		“Well, when I was whenthat’s I was really young I had a book of basketball statistics. andNo I would spend a lot of time a lot of time reading them. And for some reason, I forget why now, but Jason Kidd ended up beingpain. Be my favorite player.”
	 “Here are probably the five biggest companies doing speech recognition, and they are all making the same kind of mistake,” said John Rickford, one of the Stanford researchers behind the study, who specializes in African-American speech. “The assumption is that all ethnic groups are well represented by these companies. But they are not.” The study tested five publicly available tools from Apple, Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft that anyone can use to build speech recognition services. These tools are not necessarily what Apple uses to build Siri or Amazon uses to build Alexa. But they may share underlying technology and practices with services like Siri and Alexa. Each tool was tested last year, in late May and early June, and they may operate differently now. The study also points out that when the tools were tested, Apple’s tool was set up differently from the others and required some additional engineering before it could be tested. Apple and Microsoft declined to comment on the study. An Amazon spokeswomen pointed to a web page where the company says it is constantly improving its speech recognition services. IBM did not respond to requests for comment. Justin Burr, a Google spokesman, said the company was committed to improving accuracy. “We’ve been working on the challenge of accurately recognizing variations of speech for several years, and will continue to do so,” he said. The researchers used these systems to transcribe interviews with 42 people who were white and 73 who were black. Then they compared the results from each group, showing a significantly higher error rate with the people who were black. The best performing system, from Microsoft, misidentified about 15 percent of words from white people and 27 percent from black people. Apple’s system, the lowest performer, failed 23 percent of the time with whites and 45 percent of the time with black people. Based in a largely African-American rural community in eastern North Carolina, a midsize city in western New York and Washington, D.C., the black testers spoke in what linguists call African-American Vernacular English — a variety of English sometimes spoken by African-Americans in urban areas and other parts of the United States. The white people were in California, some in the state capital, Sacramento, and others from a rural and largely white area about 300 miles away. The study found that the “race gap” was just as large when comparing the identical phrases uttered by both black and white people. This indicates that the problem lies in the way the systems are trained to recognize sound. The companies, it seems, are not training on enough data that represents African-American Vernacular English, according to the researchers.

	 “The results are not isolated to one specific firm,” said Sharad Goel, a professor of engineering at Stanford and another researcher involved in the study. “We saw qualitatively similar patterns across all five firms.” The companies are aware of the problem. In 2014, for example, Google researchers published a paper describing bias in an earlier breed of speech recognition. In November, during a speech at Stanford dedicated to “ethical” artificial intelligence, Eric Schmidt, the former Google chief executive and chairman, said Google and the rest of Silicon Valley were well aware that the way A.I. systems were being built needed fixing. “We know the data has bias in it. You don’t need to yell that as a new fact,” he said. “Humans have bias in them, our systems have bias in them. The question is: What do we do about it?” Companies like Google may have trouble gathering the right data, and they may not be motivated enough to gather it. “This is difficult to fix,” said Brendan O’Connor, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who specializes in A.I. technologies. “The data is hard to collect. You are fighting an uphill battle.” The companies may face a chicken-and-egg problem. If their services are used mostly by white people, they will have trouble gathering data that can serve black people. And if they have trouble gathering this data, the services will continue to be used mostly by white people. “Those feedback loops are kind of scary when you start thinking about them,” said Noah Smith, a professor at the University of Washington. “That is a major concern.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/speech-recognition-bias-apple-amazon-google.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,1274
2017-07-17 17:16:00,2017,7.0,17,Hacker Allegedly Steals $7.4 Million in Ethereum with Incredibly Simple Trick," A hacker has allegedly just stolen around $7.4 million dollars worth of ether, the cryptocurrency that underpins the app platform ethereum, by tricking victims into sending money to the wrong address during an Initial Coin Offering, or ICO. This is according to a company called Coindash that says its investors were sending their funds to a hacker. On Monday, Coindash, which offers a trading platform for ether, was slated to launch its Initial Coin Offering. These are essentially crowdfunding drives that allow investors to own a stake in the app by buying digital assets called tokens. Initial Coin Offerings are an incredibly popular method of funding an app on ethereum, and some ICOs have raked in millions of dollars within minutes of going live. Even the silliest apps have been able to raise thousands of dollars in token investments during recent ICOs. Coindash's ICO, like many others, launched simply by posting a string of text representing an ethereum address for investors to send money to on the app's website. However, mere minutes into what was supposed to be another successful ICO, Coindash warned that its website had been hacked and asked people not to send ethereum to the posted address. It's still unclear exactly what happened, but it seems like the hack was incredibly simple: The hacker allegedly took control of the Coindash official website and changed the text on the site, publishing their own ether wallet address instead of Coindash's. When people went to ""invest"" in Coindash, they actually sent their ether to the hacker, not the company. Even though Coindash noticed the hack and warned investors quickly—just three minutes after the ICO launch—the damage was done. ""WEBSITE HACKED,"" Emmanuel Gimenez, an employee of Coindash, wrote in the company's official Slack account, which Motherboard obtained access to. ""GUYS WEBSITE IS HACKED! Don't send your ETH!!!,"" the Coindash account on the popular Bitcointalk forum wrote at roughly 9:06 AM EDT, six minutes after the ICO launch. ""The Token Sale is done, do not send any ETH to any address,"" Coindash announced on Twitter on Monday morning. At the time of writing, would-be investors have sent 43,438.45 ether (around $7.4 million USD at the current exchange rate) to the Coindash address that the company says belongs to a hacker. Etherscan, a web tool for tracking ethereum transactions, is warning that ""there are reports that the Coindash Crowdsale address has been compromised."" ""All we know now is that an outside attacker changed the address right after the sale started,"" Ram Avissar, the marketing director of Coindash, told Motherboard via Slack. ""We have halted the Token Sale contract and trying to understand the best way to compensate those who were affected."" In a statement published in the company's Slack channel, Coindash said that it ""suffered a hacking attack"" where an ""unknown perpetrator"" or hacker ""maliciously placed"" a fraudulent ethereum address on its website. In response, some users on social media are crying foul. On Reddit, for example, users are speculating that the hack was really an ""inside job"" that allowed Coindash's creators to run off with millions of dollars while blaming an anonymous hacker who will likely never be found. There's no proof of any foul play on Coindash's part, however, and Occam's Razor may favour Coindash's own explanation: A hacker simply took advantage of the weakest security link in the ICO. That is, the Coindash website itself. Read more: An Idiot's Guide to Building an Ethereum Mining Rig Whoever is the culprit, investors are angry at Coindash. ""Oh come on i have already sent my eth,"" wrote a user of Bitcointalk. ""I want my money back. It's your website and it's your fault that not do everything for the security."" Another person who claimed to have invested wrote on the Bitcointalk forum: ""Too late, I already invested!!!! Already 31k ETH send to the address!!! You guys better get my money back."" Motherboard could not confirm that these people had actually invested, but Etherscan confirms that large amounts of ether was transferred to the address. The alleged hack is one of the biggest in ethereum to date. After a token-based ethereum investment fund called the DAO lost more than $50 million in a hack last year, ethereum's developers made the difficult decision to split the currency in two in order to restore the lost funds. However, that move was seen by many as unnecessarily risky (and spawned a rival cryptocurrency), and is unlikely to happen again. In the official Coindash Slack channel, the app's developers wrote that all investors, even if they sent funds to the phony address, will receive tokens. ""All CoinDash investors will get their tokens,"" the developers wrote in Slack. ""We are working to solve the situation.""

2017-01-27 00:00:00,2017,1.0,27,Microsoft's Nadella says Surface sales growing,"Devices at Microsoft are a rapidly deteriorating business. Except for one bright spot. Sales of Surface tablets and computers increased 11 percent $223 million in the fiscal second quarter, Microsoft reported on Thursday. Meanwhile, phone sales plunged 76 percent, and devices as a whole dropped 35 percent to $1.4 billion in revenue. ""I am excited about the customer reception to Surface Studio, our latest innovation in the Surface line and a new device category,"" said CEO Satya Nadella on the company's earnings conference call. ""Demand for the devices has remained strong."" The mobile market has long been a struggle for Microsoft, with consumers preferring Apple's iPhones and Google-powered Android devices. Mobile market share for Windows sank to 0.3 percent as of November, according to IDC. That makes the Surface even more important for Microsoft as PC shipments continue to fall. Along with increasing Surface revenue, Microsoft also reduced its sales and marketing spending associated with Surface, phones and Windows 10 by 13 percent over the prior year. One big Surface customer got a shout out from Nadella. Her Majesty Revenue and Customs, the UK's tax and payments authority, rolled out Surface devices to more than 25,000 employees, he said. Still, not all analysts were thrilled with the numbers. Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said he was expecting closer to 25 percent growth in Surface sales and attributed the shortfall to constrained supply of the high-end Surface Studio and limited enhancements to other products in the family.

2017-02-27 18:11:00,2017,2.0,27,Paranoid Spouses Can Spy on Partners' iOS 10 Devices with iCloud Backups,"  This story is part of  When Spies Come Home, a Motherboard series about powerful surveillance software ordinary people use to spy on their loved ones.   Last week, Motherboard demonstrated a piece of Android malware that can remotely turn on a smartphone's microphone, track the user's location, and intercept phone calls. When buying similar spyware for iPhones, attackers typically need to jailbreak the device first so they can then install unauthorized apps—a technical barrier that may take some time.  But companies do offer monitoring solutions for iPhones that apparently work on iOS 10 devices and don't require a jailbreak. Instead, they take advantage of another aspect of Apple products that some users may overlook—iCloud backups. Although the method isn't sophisticated, and the attacker requires a target's Apple ID and password, it still highlights the options available to someone trying to monitor their spouse using off-the-shelf tools.  ""Keeping tabs on the online activities of kids and employees on all iOS devices has gotten even simpler as jailbreak is no longer a prerequisite for Mobistealth to work,"" the website for Mobistealth, the company that sells the monitoring tool, reads.  According to the website, Mobistealth's non-jailbroken iOS solution can monitor call logs and the phone's contact list, steal photos stored on the device, read all WhatsApp conversations, and remotely track the location of the phone using GPS. It can also log other communication apps, such as WeChat, Kik and LINE. (The company also sells spyware for jailbroken iPhones, normal Android devices, and computers.)  Mobistealth markets its products towards business owners that want to monitor employees, or to help parents keep tabs on their children. However, several other websites, which include Mobistealth branding, advertise spyware as suitable for monitoring a partner. A YouTube video, which includes a Mobistealth referral link, markets the product for spying on a ""cheating spouse."" In other words, even if a company doesn't explicitly state its tool can be used to snoop on partners, third-party affiliates, who can make money from promoting products, still do so.   Motherboard contacted Mobistealth and asked whether one could use the company's products to spy on their wife or lover.  ""Yes,"" the representative said.  When pressed about whether a user would need to obtain the target's consent first for legal reasons, or whether one can just use it to target a device without permission, the representative said, ""Yes, you can do that.""  As mentioned, Mobistealth uses a non-jailbroken iPhone's iCloud backup to obtain its data. According to Apple's website, ""iCloud backups include nearly all data and settings stored on your device.""  An attacker needs the Apple ID and password of the phone they want to monitor. After registering that account with Mobistealth, the company will start pulling data straight away, Mobistealth's website reads. Ostensibly, the monitoring solution would no longer work if the password for the Apple ID was changed.  ""Please note that iCloud backup is normally enabled on the device by default,"" it continues. An attacker does not need physical access to the device.  Apple did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Some may think that requiring an Apple ID and password would make this attack fairly low risk, but that overlooks the complex threat many targets, especially victims of domestic violence, may face. An abuser can force a victim to give up their password; an attacker could provide the target with a pre-registered phone; or perhaps a married couple already shares passwords.  ""You'll discover the thuth [truth] in a matter of matters,"" the caption of the affiliate YouTube video advertising Mobistealth's products reads.  If you are concerned that consumer spyware may have been installed on your phone,  here is some basic advice on what to do next . Update: This piece has been updated to add that the monitoring solution likely would no longer work if the Apple ID password was changed.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4xpgnj/paranoid-spouses-can-spy-on-partners-ios-10-devices-with-icloud-backups,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,639
2016-05-31 18:06:00,2016,5.0,31,All Your Base Are Belong to 25 Years Of,"Before Pepe, before Dat Boi, before Doge… there was Zero Wing.  The video game's poor English translation has fed the internet meme machine for decades with the nonsensical phrase ""All your base are belong to us"" since ""at least"" 1998, according to online compendium Know Your Meme. But more importantly, the game was ported from its original arcade format to the Sega Mega Drive on May 31, 1991—exactly 25 years ago today.  Zero Wing may have spawned the first mainstream internet meme, and the first meme ever to be summarily run into the ground by nerds.  A presciently-titled Wired article from 2001—the headline ""When Gamer Humor Attacks"" is a lot less innocent post-Gamergate—charted the meme's rise from a flash video to forum mainstay, and its description of the world's response presaged what happens today when a new meme emerges from the ether of the web to freak out the Olds and the Normals:  A sign of simpler times? Not really. As precious as the idea of ""web reporters"" begging internet types to explain the latest meme is, we still do it.  Why are teens tweeting ""fuck me daddy"" at the Pope? We'd better ask some teens and find out. Why is everyone losing their shit over a CGI frog riding a unicycle? Newsrooms are on the case. Even the human subjects of latter day memes have been subject to heartfelt (or not) ""where are they now?""-style write-ups.  When ""All your base are belong to us"" blew up, internet memes were still a relatively new concept to the mainstream. Now, they're the waters we swim in, but the sheer quantity of niche memes proliferating across the web on any given day hasn't done anything to lessen our interest. Hell, explaining them is a vehicle to success on its own.  Perhaps the most prescient quote in the aforementioned Wired article comes from an anonymous internet commenter: ""This just goes to show, things don't have to make sense to be funny.""

2019-07-14 00:00:00,2019,7.0,14,Ebola: DR Congo confirms first case in city of Goma on border with Rwanda," (CNN)The Ebola virus has reached the Congolese city of Goma, a major transit hub that is home to more than 1 million people on the Rwandan border. The case, which was confirmed Sunday by the country's Ministry of Health, has raised fears that the virus could make its way across the porous border into still-uninfected Rwanda -- something health experts have been working desperately to prevent. The ministry announced Sunday that a sick pastor had arrived in the regional center by bus from the northeastern city of Butembo, where the virus first struck last September.  Authorities said they had tracked down all the passengers on the bus and the driver.  As a result of the speed in which the patient was quickly isolated and transferred to an Ebola treatment center, the risk of the disease spreading in Goma was low, the ministry said. The bus driver and the 18 other passengers will be vaccinated on Monday. Since the latest outbreak began in the Democratic Republic of Congo last August, the virus has ravaged the northeastern provinces of North Kivu -- where Goma and Butembo are located -- and neighboring Ituri. A total of 2,489 cases have been reported in the central African nation, killing a total of 1,665 people, according to the Ministry of Health. Health officials and aid organizations have dreaded Ebola's arrival in Goma for months, and have been working to prepare for the eventuality -- which is partly why the case was immediately caught and isolated. ""While not welcome news, it is something we have long anticipated,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said on Twitter. ""We have been doing intensive work to prepare Goma so that any case is identified and responded to immediately."" These preparation measures include an emergency response team that has carried out outbreak simulation exercises, WHO teams that screen travelers at every entry and exit point in Goma, and workers who check the city's health centers every morning for suspected cases, according to WHO officials. In another tweet, Ghebreyesus said that 3,000 health workers in Goma had been vaccinated, and that the sick pastor is being treated in the Ebola Treatment Center in Goma, run by the DRC Ministry of Health and Doctors without Borders. More funding needed to tackle Ebola, UN says On Monday the UN's Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock said a ""big scale up"" in donations is needed in order to tackle the Ebola outbreak. ""Unless there's a big scale up in the response, were unlikely to be successful in getting to zero cases,"" Lowcock said during a meeting in Geneva. He said the DRC efforts have received a fraction of the donations given during the 2014-15 outbreak in West Africa. Unlike the 2014 outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people, there are now vaccines and experimental treatments for Ebola. Yet, despite these exhaustive preventative and treatment efforts, fighting Ebola has proved difficult because of community mistrust, limited health care resources, difficult-to-access locations, and violent attacks on heath care workers. Lowcock warned that without more funding, Ebola treatment centers will close, that there will be fewer mobile response teams available and security risks could increase. ""From a financial standpoint, the cheapest strategy is to invest at this point ... rather than let the outbreak linger and invest at a later point,"" Lowcock said. He added that two Ebola responders were murdered over the weekend. Earlier this year, unknown assailants destroyed Ebola treatment centers in Butembo. In April, a World Health Organization epidemiologist was killed in an attack on the University Hospital. In total there have been 130 attacks on health facilities between January and mid-May, causing four deaths and injuring 38. All the while, the virus continues to spread -- in June, it made the long-feared jump across the DRC border to neighboring Uganda, although at this stage those isolated cases appear to be contained.

This epic avian stood an astonishing 12-feet tall and weighed an estimated 1,000 pounds, making it by far the biggest European bird known to science.  A bird of “such an impressively giant size” has never been documented in “the Northern Hemisphere in general,” according to researchers led by Nikita Zelenkov, a paleontologist at the Russian Academy of Sciences, who published findings on Wednesday in the  Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. “I was really surprised to see this bone, because I did not expect such giant birds from Europe,” Zelenkov told Motherboard in an email. The remains were found in the Taurida Cave, which was discovered last year by construction workers building a motorway between the Crimean towns of Simferopol and Kerch.   P. dmanisensis is only outmatched for the avian heavyweight title by the elephant birds of Madagascar and the mihirungs of Australia, which grew to masses of more than 1,500 pounds.  In contrast, ostriches—which are currently the largest living birds on Earth—weigh 350 pounds at most.  Because  P. dmanisensis is such an unusual species, Zelenkov and his colleagues aren’t sure where exactly it fits in the avian family tree. The team is searching for other bones, especially skulls, that might help determine its relationship to other birds, while also studying eggshell fossils that could shed light on the animal’s emergence in Europe. The anatomy of the bird’s femur suggests it was a fast sprinter, which may mean it was often on the run from animals higher in the food web. “We can only speculate about food and predators, but a herbivorous diet seems more probable—something like in ostriches,” Zelenkov said. “The fact that this giant bird retained the ability to run rather fast tell us that predators played an important role in its ecology and evolution.” It’s possible that early humans were among the bird’s predators and may have hunted them for meat, bones, feathers, and eggshell, the authors said in the study. Some of these unanswered questions could be resolved by future excavations in the Taurida Cave. In addition to fossils of the giant bird, paleontologists have uncovered the remains of saber-toothed cats, antelope, bison, hyenas, and other Pleistocene animals in the cave system. “There are still many sediments to excavate,” Zelenkov said, “so new materials will definitely come out at some point.”",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a3x89g/fossils-of-a-12-foot-tall-1000-pound-bird-found-in-crimea,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,410

Carnival, which owns the P&O cruise ship, said the spill was unintentional and amounted to 7,000 liters (1,849 gallons). But Green Party Senator Larissa Waters and local media report the spill was 27,000 liters (7,133 gallons), citing an Australian Maritime Safety Authority report presented to the Senate. That amount is equivalent to more than 100 bathtubs full of waste water.    The P&O ship spilled the polluted water on August 26, but authorities were not notified until two days later when Carnival self-reported the incident.     Australian authorities detained the ship when it returned to Sydney in early September, according to an Australian Maritime Safety Authority representative. Carnival had to pay a fine of about $1.5 million (2.1 million Australian dollars) to release the vessel. ""The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority takes pollution of the Marine Park seriously and works with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to ensure the best outcome for the Great Barrier Reef,"" said a park authority spokesperson in a statement.  The Great Barrier Reef, one of the seven natural wonders of the world, is a protected park and World Heritage site. Stretching more than 1,800 miles along the Queensland coast, the reef is large enough to be seen from space and holds the world's largest collection of corals. But scientists say the corals are on death row because of climate change and environmental damage -- prompting the Australian government to pledge almost $380 million for improving the water quality and restoring the reef this year. ""It took an anonymous tip off and my questioning in Senate Estimates today for details of a waste spill in the Great Barrier Reef by a cruise ship to be made public. Where is the transparency?!"" Sen. Waters wrote in a Facebook post about the spill. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said it is still investigating the spill, and that discharging pollutants in the reef is a serious offense.

2019-08-13 00:00:00,2019,8.0,13,"Social media use may harm teens' mental health by disrupting positive activities, study says"," (CNN)Social media use has been linked to depression, especially in teenage girls. But a new study argues that the issue may be more complex than experts think. The research, published Tuesday in the journal The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health, involved interviews with almost 10,000 children between the ages of 13 and 16 in England. The researchers found that social media may harm girls' mental health by increasing their exposure to bullying and reducing their sleep and physical exercise. ""Our results suggest that social media itself doesn't cause harm, but that frequent use may disrupt activities that have a positive impact on mental health such as sleeping and exercising, while increasing exposure of young people to harmful content, particularly the negative experience of cyber-bullying,"" study co-author Russell Viner of the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health said in a statement. In other words: Social media itself might not be to blame for mental health issues; rather, it takes away from girls' sleep quality and exercise while exposing users to cyberbullying, and that's what leads to lower well-being and problems with mental health. Bob Patton, a lecturer in clinical psychology at the University of Surrey, said this means strategies focusing only on reducing social media use as a tool to improve well-being or mental health might not help. ""Building strategies to increase resilience to cyberbullying and that promote better sleep and exercise behaviours may well be what is needed to reduce both physical and psychological harms,"" Patton, who was not involved in the research, said in a statement. For boys, the impact on their mental health seems to be due to other reasons, so further research is needed, the authors said. The difference between boys and girls The research was conducted by interviewing teenagers once a year from 2013 to 2015. They would report the frequency that they checked or used social media, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Twitter and Snapchat. More than three times daily was considered ""very frequent."" The researchers noted that they did not capture how much time participants spent on these websites, which is a limitation of the study.  In 2014 and 2015, researchers asked about the teens' psychological distress and their personal well-being, things like life satisfaction, happiness and anxiety. The researchers found that, in both sexes, very frequent social media use was associated with greater psychological distress. The effect was especially clear among girls: The more often they checked social media, the greater their psychological distress. But nearly 60% of the impact on psychological distress in girls could be accounted for by low sleep quality and greater exposure to cyberbullying, with decreased physical activity playing a lesser role. But for boys, those factors explained only 12% of the effects of very frequent social media use on psychological distress. Shedding light on how to help teens Social media has been linked to mental health issues. Just last month, research out of Canada showed that higher levels of social media use was linked with increased depressive symptoms in adolescents.  With this study, the problem is put in a better context. It's not necessarily social media that's causing these issues, it's more likely the content that young people are exposed to and its hindrance of healthy sleep and exercise. It's an important distinction, says Ann DeSmet, a professor at Ghent University in Belgium who was not involved in the research. ""If the displacement of healthy lifestyles and cyberbullying can be attenuated, the positive effects of social media use, such as encouraging social interactions, can be more endorsed,"" she said in a statement.

2018-03-22 03:00:14,2018,3.0,22,"At Mars, Jeff Bezos Hosted Roboticists, Astronauts, Other Brainiacs and Me","PALM SPRINGS, Calif. — “I get invited to everything, and everywhere I go, everyone wishes they had my job. But that’s not true here,” said Pablos Holman, a self-described futurist and inventor who has worked on lasers that kill mosquitoes and machines that suppress hurricanes. “There’s geniuses everywhere,” he said, motioning to the pair talking next to him, the theoretical physicist Lisa Randall and the computer scientist Stephen Wolfram. “I don’t even register on this scale.” We’re at Mars, an exclusive three-day conference at a midcentury-modern hotel here in the California desert run by Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, for some of the world’s most successful geeks. For its first two years, Mars was largely secret; the most prominent image that leaked was a photo of Mr. Bezos piloting a 13-foot robot last year. This year, Amazon lifted the veil and invited a handful of reporters into Mr. Bezos’s brainiac pow-wow. Amazon is eager to buoy its reputation in artificial intelligence, a focus of the conference, amid tight competition with Google. And Mr. Bezos, who according to Bloomberg is the world’s richest person with a roughly $130 billion fortune, is growing more comfortable in the spotlight, particularly as a modern-day Renaissance man. His side projects now include The Washington Post, the space firm Blue Origin and a 10,000-year clock in a West Texas mountain that ticks once a year. For Mars, Amazon and Mr. Bezos handpick the roughly 200 attendees, most from the fields of artificial intelligence, robotics and space. There are astronauts, philosophers, rocket scientists, Nobel prize winners and gravitational-wave astrophysicists. Attendance and everything else — room service, the crab legs at breakfast, seaweed wraps at the spa — were free. (The New York Times paid my way.) Mr. Bezos was visible throughout, sitting front and center at presentations and posing for photos with attendees in front of a Blue Origin space capsule. His booming laugh was easy to pick out in the crowd. When I arrived at the Parker Palm Springs hotel where the conference was held, three separate conference workers tried to carry my bag. In my room, the lights were dimmed, a cheese plate was waiting, and an Amazon Echo was playing bossa nova. A note said to keep the Echo. (I didn’t.) Atop a collection of more high-end swag was a note from Mr. Bezos: “We’ll consider this gathering a big success if you find something inspiring.” While there were dozens of multimillionaires among the attendees, many savored the luxury. “This is quite opulent compared to what I’m used to,” said Ann Karagozian, a rocket scientist from the University of California, Los Angeles. “Definitely not any academic conferences.” At dinner, seats were preassigned. After dark, free booze flowed from makeshift bars and attendees lit up high-end cigars. Mr. Bezos held court around the fire pit Sunday night, tumbler of whiskey in hand. He wore the down Patagonia jacket given to each guest — a style that has become a sort of tech-industry uniform — with jeans and cowboy boots. One attendee described the get-up as Silicon Valley meets West Texas, where Blue Origin has its main launch site. Mornings were reserved for show and tell. About a dozen attendees presented on novel businesses or scientific breakthroughs, from new techniques for studying supermassive black holes to computer chips implanted in brains that can resolve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Rich Mahoney, head of a “powered-clothing” start-up called Seismic, showed off leotards with built-in sensors and electric motors to mimic muscles — designed to help elderly or disabled wearers stand from chairs. “Intelligent, wearable strength,” he said. “This is a new clothing paradigm.” There was one clear rock star: A yellow four-legged robot named SpotMini that strutted back and forth on stage as a sea of smartphone cameras focused in. It was the newest invention from Boston Dynamics, the Defense Department-funded firm that Google recently sold to SoftBank. After the presentation, Mr. Bezos and SpotMini led the crowd to lunch. To get to lunch, attendees passed under a colorful spiked 16-foot plexiglass archway coated in a reflective dichroic film, which was originally designed to protect spacesuits from cosmic radiation — and now costs about $125 per square foot. “Four people have proposed to their girlfriends underneath it,” said Davis McCarty, the Chicago artist who built the gate in 2016 for Burning Man, the arts festival in the Nevada desert. Throughout, Amazon executives referred to repeat guests as alumni or “returning campers.” Attendees seemed universally smitten with the conference; some suggested they were a part of history. Ken Goldberg, a roboticist from the University of California, Berkeley, compared Mars to Athens 2,000 years ago, showing Raphael’s fresco “The School of Athens” during a presentation. “People would be hanging out, discussing ideas, having arguments, and a big topic at the time was space,” he said. “It’s like a true salon of its time,” said Brogan BamBrogan, an entrepreneur with a walrus mustache who now runs Arrivo, which aims to build high-speed transportation networks using levitating cars in highway medians. At lunch, Mr. Bezos played beer pong, minus the beer, against a robotic arm. (He lost.) Across the lawn, attendees played a different robotic arm in table tennis, and SpotMini — piloted by a human — mugged for cameras and snatched phones with the arm that extended from its neck. Some attendees said they were so impressed by the guest list they were unsure they belonged. The serial entrepreneur Dean Kamen, best known for inventing the Segway, said, “You feel like you’re walking around here as an intellectual midget.” In the afternoon, we had a choice of activities, from falconry to Navy Seal training to sausage making. Group meditation was popular. On Tuesday, a collective “ohhhmmm” rang out across the hotel grounds. Eighteen of us, including me, flew aerobatic planes. Most who signed up were eager to hop into the cockpit; a few later had to use the barf bag. Many were paired up for “dogfights” in which they chased each other in the sky. We were allowed to steer the plane for periods; the pilot in back also had a hand on the controls. In one dogfight, Takeo Kanade, 72, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and robotics pioneer, vanquished his opponent, Aaron Dollar, 40, an up-and-coming roboticist at Yale. “Old-man wisdom won,” Mr. Kanade said after getting out of the plane, still wearing a flight suit with his pilot call sign for the day Velcroed on: “Wolfman.” Mr. Dollar’s call sign was “Tinkerbell.” On Tuesday at about 5:45 a.m., more than a dozen attendees gathered on one lawn and craned their necks toward the sky, looking for the Humanity Star, a satellite covered in mirrors that one of them, Peter Beck, had launched into orbit. The pre-dawn group included Bob Smith, chief executive of Blue Origin, and Adam Savage, co-host of the former Discovery show “MythBusters.” About 90 seconds after the satellite was supposed to be glittering across the sky, nothing had appeared. Then, for a moment, there was a flash in the sky. “That was it!” someone shouted. Then another flash. “It reflects the sunlight from the sun and it strobes the earth like a giant disco ball,” said Mr. Beck, a New Zealander with curly hair who founded the space firm Rocket Lab. “The point is to really get people to look up and have an overview effect, and realize they’re standing on a rock in the middle of the universe.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/technology/at-mars-jeff-bezos-hosted-roboticists-astronauts-other-brainiacs-and-me.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,1245
2018-04-19 00:00:00,2018,4.0,19,Comcast and Independence Health to partner on new health care platform,"Comcast is teaming up with one of the nation's largest Blue Cross health insurers, Independence Health Group, to launch a new consumer-oriented health-care technology platform. ""The way we're viewing it is as a digital health company,"" said Brian Lobley, president of commercial and consumer markets at the Independence Blue Cross division. ""It's going to be a digital platform that is certainly going to be enabled via the TV, and the Comcast app, but [going] broader than both companies' existing footprint."" The partnership will be structured as a 50/50 joint venture, but will be run as an independent new firm. They plan to begin a pilot program of the platform in the Philadelphia area, where both companies are headquartered, with the hope of launching the new firm and then taking the platform national in the second half of 2019. ""We're going to start with people who are experiencing a health … condition or procedure,"" such as knee surgery, Lobley explained. ""There's pre-op, post-op recovery, during that time sometimes the patient is on a follow-up medication … what we're looking to do is take that experience, that itinerary that person follows and digitize it,"" he said. Comcast is Independence's largest health insurance customer, but the two have also collaborated on local health initiatives. In February, they hosted early-stage health IT start-ups focused on value-based care and improving patient health outcomes. ""Independence is a company steeped in innovation and completely committed to the consumer experience,"" said Sam Schwartz, Comcast chief business development officer in announcing the deal. ""We're excited about this new partnership and the opportunity to work together using technology to help improve the effectiveness and efficiency of patient communications and education."" Comcast is the parent of NBCUniversal and CNBC. As the nation's largest cable and broadband provider, it has worked with many of its health-care clients to offer added services, including a recent medically-approved healthy aging video series with UC Davis.The new digital venture would be the media giant's first formal investment in the health-care business. It comes at a time when health insurers and hospitals are increasingly looking to technology to help boost patient satisfaction, as consumers and employers are pressing the industry to cut costs and make it easier to access care. At the same time, tech firms like Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet's Google have looked to play a bigger role in the $3 trillion health market, with mixed success. Apple recently launched a collaboration with more than three dozen hospitals to help patients gain access to their medical records on their phones. But Amazon, after months of exploring getting into the pharmacy business, has found it too challenging to break into the health-care supply market, according to sources familiar with the situation. The new Comcast-Independence joint venture plans to develop an open platform, which they hope will encourage firms like Amazon or other tech companies to plug in services and new features. ""We definitely think that (with) the assets that Amazon has -- they obviously know how to control a consumer experience -- there could be great synergies for us to have a solution that could complement their services,"" Lobley said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/19/comcast-and-independence-health-to-partner-on-new-health-care-platform.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,523
2017-10-26 00:00:00,2017,10.0,26,Zenefits and co-founder Parker Conrad to pay SEC fine of nearly $1 million,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Silicon Valley business software startup Zenefits and its co-founder Parker Conrad have been fined nearly $1 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as part of a settlement over charges that they misled investors. Zenefits will pay a $450,000 penalty and Conrad, who resigned as the company’s chief executive in early 2016, will pay more than $533,000 to settle charges that the company lied about its compliance with state insurance regulations. San Francisco-based Zenefits and Conrad consented to the SEC’s order without admitting or denying findings that they violated federal securities laws. “This settlement closes the chapter on a journey we began 18 months ago to transform Zenefits through new values and leadership,” said Josh Stein, general counsel at Zenefits. Conrad, 37, who has since founded a new software startup, Rippling, said he was pleased to have reached an agreement with the SEC. “I’m incredibly proud of what we built there and grateful to have worked with such a talented group of people,” Conrad said of Zenefits. The SEC found that Zenefits made “false and misleading statements and omissions” related to compliance with insurance regulations in California, Washington and other states while fundraising from investors. Zenefits first publicly revealed last year, after raising a $500 million round from mutual fund Fidelity Investments and other investors, that its employees had sold health insurance without proper licensing. Zenefits makes software for businesses to automate their human resources services, such as payroll and benefits. It previously acted as a health insurance broker and charged broker fees, although last month it announced that it had scrapped that business and changed its revenue model. In its quest for growth, Zenefits failed to properly manage employees and took shortcuts, the SEC said in its order. For instance, it said, Conrad created a computer program that allowed employees to complete California licensing education requirements in fewer hours than the law required. Less than three years ago, investors had designated Zenefits as Silicon Valley’s fastest-growing software startup. Last year, in a concession to investors, Zenefits slashed its valuation by more than half to $2 billion from $4.5 billion. As part of the agreement, investors agreed not to sue Zenefits. It also last year set about improving internal controls to ensure employees complied with insurance laws, including mandated education courses and ethics training. It has settled with regulators in 50 states, most of which fined Zenefits.

2017-09-03 00:00:00,2017,9.0,3,2017 Hyundai Elantra Sport review: A lot to like but little to love,"All right, we surrender. After over a decade of Hyundai beating us over the head with advertising and brand messaging declaring itself a real contender in the automotive world, the war for our minds is over. We get it, you're a real car brand. What next, then? Consumers have a great deal of respect for the Korean company that rose from nothing to slay the kings of iron and injection, but there's little passion among owners. Despite their fantastic value and superb quality, Hyundai vehicles have yet to become inspiring. But maybe a hot compact can change that? Once desperate for a follow-up to the aging Beetle and dead Minibus, a then-niche Volkswagen helped cement its following through the GTI hot hatchback. Hoping to emulate that success, Hyundai has brought out a spicier flavor of its Corolla fighter. It's called the Elantra Sport, it costs $24,935 and I spent a week with it to find out whether it's enough to win our hearts. One of the reasons many consumers like the Volkswagen GTI is its understated, handsome looks. The Elantra Sport follows suit, with its aggressive but not overwrought styling. To buff-book-obsessed octane junkies like your author, there's enough of a distinction to show of the Sport model's aggressive intentions. To the public at large it looks a bit too vanilla to draw any extra attention. While a sedate, refined style works for established players, I'm not sure it's the right call here. A more playful look, like what Ford has done with the Focus ST and FIesta ST, helps establish performance cred. It's an attractive car, and it won't lose points here, but it's a missed opportunity to make a statement. If there's anything about this car that'll make you fall for it, it's the interior. I had no strong opinion on the Elantra's cabin before driving this car, but a week with it catapulted it to a near first-place contender. It's just so usable. The seats are comfortable and well bolstered. Controls are laid out logically, with high quality plastics covering most surfaces. I also found the car almost perfectly equipped for the class, with the only options available being a premium package — you should get it — and a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. Don't get that. I haven't driven the DCT model, but the whole point of a sports sedan is getting a more visceral driving experience for less money. A manual accomplished both parts of that mission more successfully. The Elantra also comes with Hyundai's excellent BlueLink infotainment system, which is one of the best touch-screen infotainment solutions on the market. It may not beat the controller-based system in the Mazda 3, for instance, but it's near the top of the class. It also has what quickly became my favorite minor feature of any system; in the Elantra, the car records your top 10 radio presets and allows you to rewind to the beginning of a song if you open the station part of the way through. It's brilliant. Taken as a whole, this interior is class-leading. Some compact cars' interiors are more pretty, some slightly more usable. None, though, are more of a total package. I really wanted to write about the next great sport sedan. About how Hyundai had done it, making an affordable, comfortable and stylish alternative to the segment stalwarts. It's a shame that it left me a bit cold. Straight-line performance wasn't the problem. The 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder comes on boost around 2000 rpm, pulling strong to the redline and making the most of its 201 horses. It doesn't pack the firepower of the mighty Focus ST or venerable GTI, but delivered through a smooth six-speed manual. It's certainly enough to make you smile. No, the issue was the corners. Sure, it cornered well and changed direction swiftly, but that's not enough. Hot compacts are about bringing you closer to the road, making driving a visceral experience. And the Hyundai Elantra Sport just doesn't give you that feedback. A GTI on a back road can be a revelation. The Elantra Sport felt merely like a well-sorted car. If you buy this car thinking of it as a sportier compact car, it delivers. But it isn't a true dynamic match for the hot hatchback kings. To help you forget that fact, Hyundai has priced it well below the true hot cars in the segment. The Focus ST starts at just shy of $25,000, where this fully-loaded Elantra stops. Of course, an Elantra Sport with a DCT will set you back an extra $1,100, but since the Focus doesn't offer an automatic the point is moot. A GTI, for reference, $25,595 and can be optioned to a dizzying $37,110. That car will ship with technology you can't even get on an Elantra Sport, like adaptive cruise control. Still, the Elantra Sport follows Hyundai tradition of being a superb value. As long as its prices undercut competitors and offers fewer horses and a less dynamic driving experience, it's unlikely that a Hyundai will ever be an aspirational car like fast Fords tend to be. There's a lot to like about the Elantra Sport. I just wish there was something to love.

2016-03-10 20:50:00,2016,3.0,10,The Neuroscientist Studying How Our Brains Control Our Hands,"Computers are smart enough to beat humans at chess, Go, and Jeopardy!, but when it comes to basic hand movements, robots can still only master rudimentary tasks. Robots aren't able to bake a cake or mow the lawn, for example, which means ""we don't fully understand how the brain does it,"" said neuroscientist Jörn Diedrichsen, who's working to untangle how the human brain controls hand movement. ""We don't even have a robot that can control its hand as well as a two-year-old."" Once we figure out how the brain controls fine motor skills, we'll be able to build more skilled, capable robots—and prosthetics that make us more powerful. Diedrichsen is working on that now. The scientist, who just joined Western University after leaving University College London, is focused on helping stroke patients and others regain fine motor control, although more capable robots and improved prostheses will be another outcome. Western University, in London, Ontario, is investing heavily in cognitive neuroscience research. Diedrichsen was lured there partly because of its state-of-the-art imaging facilities: The campus is home to three fMRI machines, used to measure and map brain activity. Using the scanner, he can chart people's neural activity as they perform various tasks and movements with their hands.  Diedrichsen needs as much imaging technology as he can get, given the magnitude of the mystery around what he's studying. For example, his research has found that electrical stimulation to the brain can help motor training—in a double-blinded study published in 2014, subjects who were zapped with weak currents performed 20 percent better than those who were not, and the effect lasted for a month—but the reasons why still aren't clear. Further research on so-called ""electric doping"" could potentially help stroke patients and people who have suffered a spinal cord injury recover lost function. It could also improve prosthetics by informing our understanding of how the brain and body connect. Scientists have already built bionic limbs that patients can control with their minds. But they still aren't very good. ""Our body is a complete engineering nightmare. Our muscles fatigue. Our tendons are sloppy and hard to control. We have good sensors in our fingertips, but they're not reliable,"" Diedrichsen said. ""The brain makes really amazing things out of a quite poorly engineered physical plan.""  If we could engineer something better—and harness a fuller understanding of the brain—imagine what we could do.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nz7z8b/the-neuroscientist-studying-how-our-brains-control-our-hands-robots-prosthetic-brain,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,397
2016-05-05 00:00:00,2016,5.0,5,Refugees face higher diabetes risk in poor neighborhoods,"(Reuters Health) - When refugees end up in poor neighborhoods in a new land, they may also end up with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, a Swedish study suggests. Researchers analyzed data for more than 61,000 refugees who arrived in Sweden from 1987 to 1991 to see how many of them developed diabetes roughly two decades after settling into their new communities. “Our study takes advantage of a natural experiment the Swedish government unwittingly created when it dispersed refugees across the country, more or less at random, to ease labor market conditions and help new arrivals integrate more easily into Swedish society,” said lead study author Justin White, a health economics researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. “After two decades, refugees who had been assigned to the most deprived neighborhoods were 15 percent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those in the least deprived neighborhoods,” White added by email. Globally, about one in nine adults have diabetes, and the disease will be the seventh leading cause of death by 2030, according to the World Health Organization. Most of these people have what’s known as type 2 diabetes, which happens when the body can’t properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy. Advanced age, obesity and stress are among the factors that can lead to this type of diabetes. To see how different settlement communities influenced the odds of diabetes among refugees, White and colleagues used data on poverty, unemployment, schooling and welfare enrollment to sort neighborhoods into three groups based on overall deprivation levels. Then, they looked at how many refugees were diagnosed with new cases of diabetes from 2002 to 2010 and mapped these cases to the level of deprivation in the communities where people lived. Refugees included in the study were from 25 to 50 years old and most were married with children. Half of them came from Iran or Arabic-speaking parts of the Middle East and northern Africa, while 10 percent came from other parts of Africa, 19 percent from Eastern Europe and 14 percent arrived from Latin America. Most refugees settled in larger cities, with 47 percent in high-deprivation areas and another 45 percent in moderate-deprivation communities. Overall, about 4,500 of them developed diabetes, or 7.4 percent of the study population. But when researchers sorted diabetes cases based on the neighborhood characteristics, they found 7.9 percent developed diabetes in the highest deprivation areas, compared with just 5.8 percent in the least deprived communities. One limitation of the study is that even though researchers focused on a period in Swedish history when most refugees were randomly assigned to housing, they can’t be certain all refugees in the study were in fact subject to this policy. It’s possible some refugees selected their own housing, and the factors influencing this might also impact their odds of developing diabetes. The study can’t prove that bad neighborhoods cause diabetes or show which specific types of deprivation – like poverty or bad schools – might be most responsible for the added disease risk. “It could be related to a variety of effects – such as poorer access to healthy food, less opportunity for physical activity, perhaps greater psychological stress which of itself might increase diabetes risk,” said Nigel Unwin, a professor at the Chronic Disease Research Center at the University of the West Indies and author of an accompanying editorial. Still, the findings highlight a need to consider the health impacts of neighborhoods when assigning refugees to housing as Europe grapples with high unemployment and historically high numbers of incoming refugees, the authors conclude. “It’s well known that people living in poorer neighborhoods in high income countries, such as in North America or Western Europe, tend to have higher rates of chronic health problems including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and greater risk of stroke and heart attack,” Unwin added by email. “It could simply be that the people who are unable to afford to live in more affluent neighborhoods are at greater risk of these conditions, perhaps related to poorer education and a greater prevalence of unhealthy behaviors,” Unwin added.

2020-03-26 00:00:00,2020,3.0,26,Soccer-Arteta feared infecting Arsenal team during coronavirus scare,"March 26 (Reuters) - Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta feared who he might have infected when he tested positive for coronavirus, but said on Thursday he has completed his recovery and is ready to return to work with the Premier League side. Arsenal announced Arteta’s positive test a fortnight ago on March 12, which ultimately led to the halt in the season as his side prepared to face Manchester City. The Spaniard believes he contracted the virus after the team’s Europa League clash against Greek side Olympiacos in late February. “I am feeling completely recovered,” he told Arsenal’s website. “It’s true I started having some symptoms when we got the phone call from the club (Olympiacos) to let us know that we might be exposed to the virus... I don’t know, I felt something within me, that I had it. “Then you realise, ‘Wow, everybody can be exposed here, this is very serious’ and you start to think about the people that you’ve been in contact with and the other people that can be related to us. That’s when a bit of fear comes.” Arteta said he coped with the symptoms and revealed his wife and children’s nanny had also contracted the virus. “In terms of symptoms, it was a normal virus for me. I had three or four days which were a little bit difficult, with a bit of a temperature and a dry cough, and some discomfort in my chest. That was it,” he said. “The difficulty is that I have people at home, three kids as well, and I was worried. My missus has been through it and my nanny’s been through it. Thank God, the kids never got it. We are all completely fine now.” Arteta also thanked his technical staff for keeping the players focussed in his absence. He added they will continue with individual programmes until training can begin on the pitch. “In difficult moments is where you really see the people and how they react, how they think and how they prioritise things,” Arteta said. “All the phone calls I’m having with all the members of the board and all my technical staff, all the coaching staff, all the players, how aware and how encouraged they all are to try to help, to try to be on board with the situation and to try to make things easier for the club has been amazing.” (Reporting By Nick Said Editing by Christian Radnedge)",https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-soccer-arteta/soccer-arteta-feared-infecting-arsenal-team-during-coronavirus-scare-idUSL8N2BJA1F,Healthcare,Reuters,health,408

The armed forces will be mobilized to assist civilian authorities in controlling public movement, with authorization to stop vehicles and persons until police authorities arrive and to use physical force if it is deemed absolutely necessary. The decision was not taken lightly. “A virus cannot be beaten with a machine gun,” said Krum Zarkov from the opposition Socialist party - one of the 55 deputies who voted against the deployment of the army. Zarkov called the measure unjustified, but it passed with 89 votes for, 55 against and two abstentions. As of Friday, Bulgaria had 129 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and three deaths. It has introduced a state of emergency, closed schools, restaurants and bars and banned all foreign and domestic holiday trips until April 13.

2016-01-28 00:00:00,2016,1.0,28,FDA approves Merck's new hepatitis C pill,"(Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Thursday approved a new once-daily pill for the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus made by Merck & Co Inc, which said it will sell the drug at a lower list price than its competitors. The list price for Zepatier will be $54,600 for a 12-week regimen, which Merck said it expects “to be in the range of net prices” for comparable treatments. Gilead Sciences Inc, which secured an early lead in the lucrative market for oral hepatitis C drugs with the $1,000-per-pill Sovaldi, currently sells an enhanced version of that drug as a single-tablet regimen called Harvoni at a list price of $94,500. AbbVie Inc followed in late 2014 with a multi-pill regimen. Nevertheless, AbbVie secured exclusive contracts with payers such as pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co, forcing Gilead to discount its own contract prices. Gilead has continued to dominate the market with hepatitis C drug sales of more than $14 billion in the first nine months of 2015. The Food and Drug Administration approved Zepatier, with or without the older antiviral drug ribavirin, for patients infected with the most common form of hepatitis C, genotype 1, as well as the less common genotype 4. The new drug’s FDA label says liver-related blood tests should be performed prior to starting therapy and at certain times during treatment. Clinical trials found that 12 or 16 weeks of treatment with Merck’s Zepatier reduced the virus to undetectable levels, which is considered a cure, in more than 94 percent of patients, the FDA said in a statement. Hepatitis C infects an estimated 3.2 million Americans.

2018-03-18 14:59:38,2018,3.0,18,Take This App and Call Me in the Morning,"A new category of prescription medical treatments, what executives call digital therapeutics, comes in the form of mobile apps. Health tech companies are making a big push to digitize medicine, introducing novel tools like digital pills that track when patients take their drugs and smart spoons that can automatically adjust to hand tremors. Now they want some patients to get prescription treatments from the app store as well. Later this year, doctors treating patients addicted to substances like cocaine and amphetamines will be able to prescribe Reset, an app that gives patients lessons to help them modify their behavior. The Food and Drug Administration cleared it in September as the first mobile medical app to help treat substance-use disorders. “It’s all the things you would traditionally associate with a pill or any other medication,” said Dr. Corey McCann, the chief executive of Pear Therapeutics, the start-up behind Reset. “But it just so happens to be a piece of software.” Pear Therapeutics is at the forefront of a new category of medical treatment, offering what company executives call “prescription digital therapeutics.” These products, they say, are medical apps that have been studied in randomized clinical trials, cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, require a doctor’s prescription and allow doctors to track patients’ progress. This month, in a sign of momentum behind the idea and how it might expand to other health conditions, Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, announced that it had teamed up with Pear Therapeutics. Together, they plan to develop prescription apps for schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis. Companies like Pear are trying to stand apart in a global market of more than 318,000 health apps by arguing that their products provide assurance of effectiveness and safety. The advantage of their prescription treatment software, they say, is that apps making general wellness claims — like meditation apps marketed to soothe you to sleep — do not require F.D.A. review. But medical devices like apps that claim to treat or manage disease must submit clinical evidence to the F.D.A. and get clearance. A few medical experts, however, argue that the apps, while promoting themselves as a new medical therapy, are essentially just repackaging and rebranding existing treatments. They note that behavioral therapy done on a computer, instead of on a smartphone, was already a longstanding health treatment and backed by research. “This is a branding effort that is meaningless,” said Dr. Allen J. Frances, a psychiatrist who is a professor emeritus at the Duke University School of Medicine. “F.D.A. approval comes easily, and a prescription doesn’t guarantee greater efficacy.” Dr. McCann, a former neuroscientist and venture capitalist, co-founded Pear Therapeutics in 2013. The start-up has since raised $70 million and licensed a variety of digital therapeutics from researchers and other companies. The Reset mobile app, for instance, is based on a web-based addiction therapy program. It was originally developed in the late 1990s by behavior modification researchers who digitized long-established methods of in-person addiction therapy. Reset is not the first prescription mobile medical app. The F.D.A. previously cleared software like BlueStar Rx, a prescription diabetes management app. But Reset is different because its primary focus is not disease management. It delivers an established behavior-modification treatment for addiction — which traditionally involves face-to-face outpatient therapy — entirely in digital form. In other words, the app itself is the medicine. Anyone will be able to download the Reset app, expected to be available in the second half of the year. But to get it to work on a smartphone, patients must enter a prescription access code. A prescription will be good for 90 days. The F.D.A. cleared the app to be used in conjunction with outpatient therapy. The Reset app contains 61 therapy units, with titles like “Coping With Thoughts About Using,” including lessons, skills-building exercises and quizzes on the material. The recommended dose: four therapy lessons per week. The idea behind the app is to teach patient skills — such as avoiding situations that trigger their substance use or learning how to refuse an offer of drugs — to modify their behavior, thereby promoting abstinence. The app has a dashboard that doctors can use to monitor their patients’ progress. After patients complete a lesson, they receive encouraging feedback or gift cards — an established method for replacing addiction highs with more benign stimuli. Patients also receive rewards if they test negative for substance use. In clinical trial results that Pear submitted to the F.D.A., substance-abuse patients who used online therapy lessons had higher abstinence rates after nine to 12 weeks than patients who had not used them. Addiction is often chronic, however, and six months after the study, abstinence rates among the two patient groups were about the same. The arrival of Reset coincides with an F.D.A. effort to introduce more flexible ways of regulating digital health software for patients. Because such apps pose little risk to patients, they face a lower bar for agency authorization than high-risk prescription drugs or devices implanted in the body, said Bakul Patel, the associate director for digital health at the F.D.A.’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “We look for a clinical study that gives reasonable assurance of evidence to the claims that people are making,” Mr. Patel said. Since web-based behavior therapy is already a longstanding treatment, however, critics say the app format isn’t much of a medical innovation. In addition, several medical experts questioned the clinical trial data that Pear provided to the agency, because it came from a study of the precursor desktop-based therapy product, not the mobile app. Dr. Frances, the psychiatrist, said the study was also problematic because it offered financial incentives only to the patients who used the web-based program — making it difficult to determine whether it was the online program, the money or just newness that temporarily increased their abstinence. Dr. McCann, Pear’s chief executive, said that Reset used the same content as the web-based program and that it had been designed to be used with behavioral incentives — which is why it offers financial rewards. “The two, when used in combination, produce the efficacy effect,” he said. Pear has also submitted an opioid addiction treatment app called Reset-O, which works in conjunction with anti-addiction medication, for F.D.A. review. “It’s a very novel approach to treating certain central nervous system conditions,” said Gary Nachman, a specialty pharmaceuticals analyst at BMO Capital Markets who hosted a conference call for investors with Pear executives in January. The Reset app has the potential to gain a slice of the $35 billion addiction treatment market, and pave the way to treat other conditions, like depression and anxiety, Mr. Nachman said. Akili, another digital medicine start-up, is developing prescription video games to treat childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Even so, Mr. Nachman cautioned that many unknowns remained. For one thing, he said, treatment apps, like other novel medical products, may turn out to be less effective in the real world than in research studies. But big pharmaceutical companies are paying attention. The partnership between Pear and Novartis, a leading maker of neurological drugs, could add some major drug industry credibility and research power to the push for prescription digital therapeutics. Dr. James E. Bradner, president of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, said the two companies planned to rigorously test each app first as a stand-alone treatment and then in combination with prescription medications. He added that he believed such treatment apps might one day improve results for patients with psychiatric disorders. “Even five years ago, this was science fiction,” Dr. Bradner said. “We are in a brave new world of therapeutic potential.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/technology/take-this-app-and-call-me-in-the-morning.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,1271

2016-02-24 00:00:00,2016,2.0,24,Colorado visitors end up in ERs more for pot use than residents,"By Andrew M. Seaman (Reuters Health) - Marijuana is sending visitors to Colorado to hospital emergency rooms at an increasing rate, according to a new study. The same isn’t true of Colorado residents, however. The results suggest that marijuana dispensaries need to do a better job of educating people buying their product, said the study’s lead author. “The thing we’d like to emphasize is that the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has done a good job of educating residents about the health effects of marijuana legalization and marijuana use,” said Dr. Howard Kim, of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. “I think reaching visitors is a much harder task,” said Kim, who worked on the study while at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora. Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and the District of Columbia have all legalized the recreational use of small amounts of marijuana, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Colorado legalized medical marijuana in 2000, the researchers note in the New England Journal of Medicine. The state then voted in 2012 to legalize recreational marijuana starting in 2014. “We noticed an increasing number of patients coming to the ER who seemed to be from out of town and we decided to look at the data to see if that was the case,” said Kim. For the study, they compared data on visits to their ER for causes related to use of various drugs by Colorado residents and people from out of state. Symptoms involved in the visits included cardiac, respiratory and gastric problems as well as “altered mental status.” They found that ER visits related to marijuana by people from out of state nearly doubled, from 85 per 100,000 visits in 2013 to 168 per 100,000 visits in 2014, which is the first year recreational marijuana was sold legally. Meanwhile, ER visits for marijuana use remained stable for Colorado residents between 2013 and 2014 at about 110 per 100,000 visits. Rates of marijuana-related ER visits were also consistent for the two groups between 2012 and 2013, which was before legalized recreational marijuana. To confirm their findings on a larger scale, the researchers then looked at the same data from more than 100 hospitals across Colorado and got similar results. For example, ER visits related to marijuana use by people from out of state increased about 46 percent between 2013 and 2014. That compared to about a 17 percent increase among Colorado residents. ER visits related to use of other drugs did not change as dramatically over the same time period. Statewide, for example, ER visits for opioids rose by about 10 per 10,000 among both visitors and residents. Kim said a number of reasons could explain the larger increase in cannabis-related ER visits among people from outside Colorado. For example, people on vacations tend to use more marijuana. Also, visitors may be trying marijuana edibles, which have delayed effects, for the first time. The researchers also caution that doctors might have become more aware of marijuana use after legalization. “I would say visitors to states with legal marijuana should be aware of side effects of legal marijuana use,” said Kim. “If they decide to use, they should do it safely and in moderation.” In states considering marijuana legalization, he said, policymakers should think of campaigns to educate the public and anticipate this as an issue.

2017-07-25 00:00:00,2017,7.0,25,Logitech increases outlook after first-quarter beats forecasts,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Logitech International raised its profit outlook for the year after strong sales of its gaming and video collaboration products helped the computer peripheral maker beat forecasts in its first quarter. The Swiss-U.S. company said it now expects operating income of $260 million to $270 million, up from its previous view of $250-260 million. Logitech made a good start to its financial year, Chief Executive Bracken Darrell said, with around two percentage points of growth expected to come from the acquisition this month of Astro, a maker of headsets for console gamers. “We feel good about the year and that’s why we raised our guidance,” he told Reuters. “Our game plan is to go aggressively after growth and profitability.” Logitech’s PC Gaming business — specialized keyboards and mice for people who play games online — had a strong quarter, with sales up 38 percent. “Will it continue at nearly 40 percent? Probably not, but PC gaming is on fire,” Darrell said. “There are more and more people playing video games on PCs, with keyboards and headsets. “In online gaming, people want faster keyboards and every little edge counts,” he said. Sales of accessories for tablet computers like detachable keyboards, previously a laggard, also increased, although this reflected an easy comparison with last year’s figures, Darrell said. But the PC speakers and earphones business struggled, with sales down 11 percent, as the company’s Jaybird wireless earphones business underperformed. Logitech increased sales to $530 million during the three months ended June 30 from $480 million a year earlier, beating forecasts of $512 million in a Reuters poll. Net profit increased to $37 million, ahead of estimates of $26 million. The company would use cash for its ongoing $250 million share buy-back, dividends and acquisitions, Darrell said, although it was unlikely a purchase would be bigger than the $85 million acquisition of Astro. The company’s stock has been one of the strongest performing tech stocks in Europe, gaining 47 percent in 2017. The shares opened 4 percent higher in Switzerland. “Logitech’s business model proves to work once again with solid growth despite one disappointing category and solid margin structures allowing to boost growth further,” said Vontobel analyst Michael Foeth, who rates the stock “buy” and raised his price target to 43 francs from 39 after the result.

2016-01-27 16:59:00,2016,1.0,27,South African Scientists Think Software and Tribal Knowledge Can Predict Drought,"Earlier in January, the UN announced that 14 million South Africans may go hungry thanks to reduced crop production—the result of a severe drought that's drying the region out. The next time a drought hits, a team of researchers at the Central University of Technology in Free State, South Africa want local governments and peoples to be prepared. To that end, they're working on software that mixes modern and ancient knowledge to predict the onset of droughts. ""The research is born out of necessity,"" Adeyinka Akanbi, one of the researchers leading the work along with Dr. Muthoni Masinde, told me over Skype. ""Right here in sub saharan Africa, we've been dealing with drought for the last couple of years and it's getting worse. We're looking for much more innovative ways to forecast and predict complex environmental phenomena."" The first step in the researchers' system is to collect the traditional wisdom of local indigenous peoples about environmental events and what they mean—the blooming of a particular tree, for example. These correlations make up what's called an ""ontology."" By feeding this information into what's known as a complex event processing engine, the idea is to give weather sensor data some additional context. ""For example, with the blooming of the tree, when it is captured in the ontology, the inference engine will be able to predict that the rain is going to fall soon,"" said Akanbi. The trick is to build software that combines this information with a continuous stream of sensor data on soil moisture levels, temperature, and more. ""The program puts them together and refines and improves the accuracy of the prediction,"" Akanbi added. For the current drought, Al Jazeera reports that no end is in sight, and the hot and dry conditions are expected to last for at least a few more months. So far, the team in South Africa has set up a wireless sensor network made up of Libelium sensor boards in Thaba 'Nchu, a fertile region in Free State that is home to Tswana and Sotho peoples. The university has also already sent researchers out to 13 different villages in the region to make contact with three different tribes, in order to learn from them. The way Akanbi tells it, this has been the most challenging part of the project so far. ""When you try to go to these remote places, if you're not part of the tribe, they are not so welcoming,"" Akanbi said. ""We had to get someone to act as an intermediary for the researcher, and we were able to gather this knowledge through workshops, questionnaires, and one on one interviews."" The process took months, Akanbi said, and the researchers offered monetary incentives to the tribespeople in return, and cell phones so they could stay in contact. Akanbi also emphasized that the project is global in scope—the team hopes that when all is said and done, their software could be just as useful for governments (and individuals) in Canada, for example, as it is in South Africa. Canada is an ideal candidate for this approach to weather prediction because First Nations peoples in Canada have a long history of watching for signs in nature to predict the weather, from the migration of birds to the position of the moon. ""There's a lot of literature on scientists recognizing that indigenous people have a lot to tell scientists, especially in ecology,"" said Glen Aikenhead, a professor at the University of Saskatchewan's college of education specializing in cross-cultural science education. Compensating indigenous peoples in return for their knowledge, which Akanbi's team attempted to do, would be one problem for any governments attempting to survey them, Aikenhead said. The bigger issue, however, would be ensuring that they also have a stake in how their knowledge is used to make policy decisions in a country that has a long, dark history of oppressing and exploiting its indigenous peoples. For example, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act gives authorities the discretion to consider indigenous knowledge in any environment assessment, but that input doesn't necessarily translate into action. ""It turns out that these elders would share this knowledge in good faith, and the scientists would listen, but then when a decision was made, the question is who has the power to make that decision?"" Aikenhead said. ""It was always the scientists back in Ottawa, or back in the corporate boardroom, that said okay, we've learned this from the elders, but this is what we're going to do."" Even so, Akanbi said, the knowledge is there, and so is the technology to make use of it—but more importantly, South Africa needs to get ready for the next drought, once it makes it through the current one. ""These sensor networks, thanks to the Internet of Things, are readily available,"" Akanbi said. ""You can easily get rainfall and soil moisture, and temperature, even on the internet nowadays."" ""The only thing that's missing is the indigenous knowledge.""",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vv7dvd/south-african-scientists-think-software-and-tribal-knowledge-can-predict-drought,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,821
2019-06-03 14:33:00,2019,6.0,3,This Clothing Line Was Designed By AI," The “little black dress” has been considered a staple in women’s fashion since the designer Coco Chanel popularized it in the 1920s. Since then, it’s seen many iterations, most recently, by machine-learning software developed by two recent MIT graduates, called Glitch.  Pinar Yanardag and Emily Salvador met at MIT while taking a course called “How to Generate (Almost) Anything,” which encouraged students to use deep learning software for creative projects. In that course, they dabbled with creating AI-generated art, perfume and jewelry, and were inspired to start Glitch, a new clothing company that sells pieces designed by AI.   “The ‘little black dress’ is considered an essential item that should be in any woman’s wardrobe,” said Yanardag. “Sooner or later, AI is going to be an essential tool for any person in computing, so we thought the ‘little black dress’ was a good place to start.”   The designs generated by Glitch are then sent to designer who brings it to life. Right now, a few designs are available for purchase on their site, with 50 percent of Glitch’s sales of their take on the ‘little black dress’ being donated to AnitaB.org, an organization that supports women entering STEM fields. So far, the majority of their sales have been to women working in tech. “On the surface may look like a nice dress or something,” Salvador said. “But underneath is this powerful statement about your affinity for tech, or your interest in AI and computation.”  The idea, they said, is to use AI in a way that might inspire women to enter the artificial intelligence field, and they plan to create easy-to-use AI tools to generate further interest in the field.   “We are trying to democratize the usage of these AI systems for the public by releasing these tools,” said Yanardag. “If you don’t have these high-end CPUs it is very difficult to actually create these systems. We think in the near future this tech will be much cheaper and more accessible, but right now that isn’t the case.” One of the tools Salvador and Yanardag developed allows users to generate and choose their own designs that their Glitch tool generates. They think insight about the kinds of designs that customers gravitate to is information that could benefit designers.  “These tools are meant to empower human designers,” Salvador said. “What I think is really cool about these creative-focused AI tools is that there’s still this really compelling need for a human to intervene with the algorithm.”",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vb9pgm/this-clothing-line-was-designed-by-ai,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,414

2017-04-28 10:00:00,2017,4.0,28,How Long Could Humans Live If All Diseases Were Cured?," For a while now, the most common causes of death around the world have been relatively constant, albeit varied depending on place: heart disease and respiratory illness rank high in the list regardless of country, while in some parts of the developing world infectious diseases like malaria and HIV/AIDS take a larger toll. But what if, in some as-yet undiscovered medical breakthrough, these conditions and all other causes of physical infirmity could be cured? How long would we live, if the only way we died was when an accident or injury befell us?  According to a calculation by statistics website Polstats.com the answer is a respectable 8,938 years on average: long enough that humans born in the Neolithic period would still be alive today.  To give a sense of what that looks like, the website uses an interactive simulation of a 100-strong population, who die off over time as accidents randomly occur. (Some of the Reddit discussion of the site has focused on the lone outliers who may survive 50,000 years or more.) Of course, the website is mostly an example of how to have fun with statistics and doesn't pretend to be making any scientifically valid claims, but some of the methods used still do resemble professional epidemiology. Dr Katherine Keyes, Associate Professor of Epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, confirmed that the basic technique—calculating the incidence of types of death in a population based on the statistical likelihood of accidents—is sound, even if the list of causes selected by Polstats are incomplete. But rather than asking what would happen if all diseases were eliminated, an epidemiologist is more often concerned with how the average life expectancy would change if just one cause of death could be reduced. ""There has been some interesting work that has shown that one of the central reasons the US lags behind a lot of similarly positioned nations [in life expectancy] is the burden of injury, which especially afflicts younger individuals: firearm related homicide and suicide for example, and drug poisoning,"" Keyes said in a phone call. In this case ""injury"" refers to causes of death outside illness, what Polstats calls 'unnatural' although those who study mortality avoid the term. In fact, Keyes says that rather than imagine a drastically raised life expectancy all round, much of her work involves questioning why certain groups have worse outcomes than others. ""Trends in life expectancy are troubling right now in the US,"" she said. ""The most recent analyses available indicate that for the first time we're seeing declines in life expectancy for some demographic groups, especially those at the lower end of the socioeconomic ladder. There have been gains in life expectancy, but those have been almost exclusively confined to high socioeconomic status groups, so there's a widening disparity between the haves and the have-nots."" While it's fun to imagine what might happen if injury became the only cause of death, the sad truth of the evidence we have is that there's a lot more work to be done before we're anywhere near.

2016-10-07 19:39:24,2016,10.0,7,Salesforce Shareholders Besiege Possible Twitter Deal,"SAN FRANCISCO — The investor pressure began building on Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.com, two weeks ago. On Sept. 23, news broke that Mr. Benioff’s company was in discussions to buy the troubled social media company Twitter. Inside the offices of hedge funds and mutual fund companies on Wall Street and elsewhere, investors in Salesforce immediately began to question the rationale for buying Twitter. They were not happy. The investors made their concerns known to Mr. Benioff. In emails and other communications, the shareholders told the chief executive and Salesforce’s investor relations team that they disapproved of a tie-up with Twitter. The effort was led by Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund firm that is Salesforce’s largest shareholder, with about 14 percent of the company. At least one Fidelity portfolio manager emailed Salesforce about the deal being a bad idea, according to people briefed on the correspondence, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the communications were private. Other Salesforce investors, including hedge funds, said they would sell the company’s stock, according to two people with knowledge of the communications. By this Wednesday, when Mr. Benioff spoke at an investor meeting at a San Francisco hotel, his language about any deal had turned conciliatory and defensive. “I read all of your notes, you probably know that,” Mr. Benioff said. “I also read your emails. And as I digest all of that information, this is actually the No. 1 thing that has been on my mind. In some cases we have been unusually surprised and we have had to do a reset.” The pushback offers a window into how big investors can exert pressure on would-be deals behind the scenes. Salesforce is particularly vulnerable to what its large institutional investors think because the unprofitable online software company relies heavily on its stock to make acquisitions and pay employee compensation. As a result, the company needs to keep investors happy for its share price to continue going up. Salesforce declined to comment, as did a representative from Fidelity. It is unclear whether or not Mr. Benioff will continue to pursue Twitter. One person involved in the negotiations said that, for now, Salesforce’s shareholders have halted a potential deal. For Twitter, that would mean that its options have narrowed. The social media company had been talking to potential buyers, as well as considering divestitures and layoffs to focus its business. But companies including Google, Apple and Disney are not interested in buying Twitter, people at those companies said, and Salesforce appeared to be one of the last interested parties. Twitter as well as Google and Apple declined to comment. Disney did not respond to calls. Recode earlier reported that Google, Apple and Disney would not make bids. Even though Salesforce is a 17-year-old company, in some ways Mr. Benioff still runs it like a start-up, making promises of boundless growth and equity riches for all employees. Salesforce does not have much cash on hand — just over $1 billion as of the end of July — compared with other tech companies, which makes it important that shareholders continue to buy its stock and enhance its value. Unlike behemoths like Microsoft, Apple and Oracle, which can turn to their multibillion-dollar cash hoards for deals, Salesforce must use a combination of stock and borrowed money to buy companies. If shareholders were to sell and drive down the value of Salesforce stock, that would hurt Mr. Benioff’s deal-making capabilities. Salesforce needs to aggressively acquire companies to keep its revenue growing as its core business, customer-management software, slows, said Mark Moerdler, a senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. The company’s reliance on stock can sometimes be a negative. Earlier this year, for example, Salesforce offered a higher per share price than rivals to buy the professional social-networking site LinkedIn. Yet LinkedIn ultimately took a lower offer from Microsoft that was all in cash. Salesforce also depends on stock to pay its employees. During the company’s fiscal year ended Jan. 31, it paid out $593.6 million in stock-based compensation, about 8 percent of its total sales. The recent investor pushback puts Mr. Benioff, who has long been a shareholder darling, in an unfamiliar position. Salesforce shares have zoomed higher since pricing at $11 in its initial public offering to around $71 now, as investors clamored to own a piece of one of the first companies to successfully convince big enterprises to rent out software that is stored in the cloud, rather than own it and run it themselves. But after the Twitter news broke, investors pushed the stock down by as much as 8 percent over the next 10 days. On Wednesday, during Mr. Benioff’s investor meeting where he sometimes gazed upon his own image projected on an enormous screen above the crowd, he bristled at times over the shareholder reaction. “Well, what about this one deal right here!” Mr. Benioff said, using a shrill and mocking voice to imitate one shareholder email. “I mean the kind of things that I have been reading in the emails are so extreme I am like, Jesus, do they really think that we would do a deal at that level?” Mr. Benioff emphasized that he is a careful deal maker who is sensitive to what any acquisition might mean for Salesforce’s shareholders, which include large, influential institutions like T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Sands Capital Management and Harbor Funds. “I don’t believe in running the company like a lone wolf,” he said, pointing to his board members who sat in the front row. But he still left the door open, ever so slightly, for future acquisitions. “We believe innovation happens not just in Salesforce, but in other companies,” he said.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/technology/salesforce-shareholders-besiege-possible-twitter-deal.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,950

2017-04-24 00:00:00,2017,4.0,24,EU states push back against 25-year wireless spectrum licenses,"(Reuters) - Germany and Italy are among 15 European Union member states pushing back against a proposal to set a 25-year minimum on wireless spectrum licenses, thwarting the telecoms industry’s hopes for a more coordinated approach across the bloc. The European Commission has tried for years to coordinate how national governments allocate so-called wireless spectrum or parcels of airwaves to mobile operators such as Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom and EE to create a single European telecoms market. Telecoms companies have also long called for a more coordinated spectrum policy. License durations vary across Europe, making it harder for the companies to operate on a larger scale and compete with U.S. rivals. But member states have in general been very sensitive about any oversight of wireless spectrum by the EU. The sale of spectrum can raise billions of euros for governments. The Commission sought to address this by proposing a minimum spectrum license duration of 25 years in a telecoms reform proposal in September. But in a position paper seen by Reuters the countries said mandatory fixed license durations were “disproportionate and insufficiently flexible to be able to respond to market developments.” Excessively long license durations risk “preventing innovation if relevant frequency bands are awarded for longer than the life cycle of a technology,” the paper said. The paper was signed by Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom. Increased spectrum trading or the possibility of withdrawing a license from an operator if it is not used are not sufficient counterbalances to the long license durations, the paper also said. These depend either on the good will of operators or require lengthy withdrawal of rights procedures with subsequent legal uncertainty due to cases of litigation, it said. Currently spectrum licenses in Europe are awarded for around 10-15 years, except for Britain, which has awarded unlimited ones. The countries also take issue with the Commission’s proposed peer review mechanism to review national regulators’ draft measures on spectrum allocation. “A peer review process as proposed ... is based on the idea that any award decision can be checked against an ideal model,” the paper said. The mandatory peer review would create an “immense bureaucratic burden” on national administrations and the Commission as well as creating legal uncertainty and risk stifling innovation. “Preserving the status quo is no good option,” said Steven Tas, Chairman of ETNO, the European telecoms lobby group representing Deutsche Telekom, Telecom Italia and Telefonica, among others. “5G roll-out requires longer licenses and a pro-investment approach to spectrum management as well as network regulation.” The EU executive has made a priority of fostering the early development of 5G mobile technology in Europe, and estimates that 5G will bring 146.5 billion euros ($159 billion) per year in benefits. The Commission’s proposals are currently being discussed by both member states and the European Parliament. Reporting by Julia Fioretti.

2018-05-29 18:27:00,2018,5.0,29,The CDC Says Synthetic Weed May Be Contaminated With Rat Poison,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning the public that synthetic marijuana could be contaminated with rat poison, after state health departments have reported more than 200 cases of poisoning with unexplained bleeding, including five deaths. The outbreak began in early March, with the Illinois Department of Public Health reporting unexplained bleeding among people who had used synthetic cannabinoids—also known as K2 or spice. These products are marketed as a cheaper alternative to produce “high” effects similar to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active ingredient in marijuana, by activating the same receptors that THC does. These synthetics can contain a variety of chemicals, and produce unpredictable results when consumed, including hallucinations and agitation. The chemicals can be sprayed on plant matter then smoked, or inhaled through e-cigarettes or added to tea or food. And despite concerns about safety, they’re widely available, even sold in convenience stores as legal marijuana alternatives. (Though it’s banned in the state of Illinois, K2 still makes its way onto shelves). In the Illinois cases, investigators found the products contained brodifacoum, a chemical used as a rat poison. Brodifacoum is an anticoagulant, which can cause bleeding disorders in healthy people who don’t need blood thinners. It produces a wide variety of awful blood-related issues, including bruising, nosebleeds, gum and mouth bleeding, urinating or vomiting blood, an excessively heavy menstrual bleeding—basically, anything you don’t want your blood to be doing. The working theory now is that rat poison was added to synthetic cannabinoids, with most of the cases (164 so far) appearing in Illinois. But they haven’t been confined to the Prairie State: Maryland has had 20 reported poisonings, while Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin have all had six or fewer cases. The CDC says that 95 people in the 202 cases reported nationwide (or 47 percent) have tested positive for brodifacoum. In April, Chicago police busted a convenience store selling K2—a variety of synthetic marketed under brand names such as ""Crazy Monkey,"" ""Blue Giant,"" and ""Matrix""—that tested positive for brodifacoum. The store owner was arrested, but it’s not clear yet whether authorities have discovered the main source of the contaminated products. New York City has also been dealing with a rising number of K2 overdoses this month—there were 14 as of May 20th, a number that skyrocketed to more than 100 at press time. Some people who overdosed spit up blood. While authorities there have also made arrests, it’s unclear whether a common supplier is involved. Investigators are still working to identify the source of the contaminants, and in the meantime the CDC is reminding the public that synthetic cannabinoids are not safe—and never have been. It’s almost impossible for people to know what they’re ingesting. Anyone who has recently used these products and is concerned about their health, the agency says, should immediately consult their healthcare provider, especially if they have any unusual bleeding or bruising.

2017-07-20 00:00:00,2017,7.0,20,Intel eliminates wearables division,"Intel has axed the division that worked on health wearables, including fitness trackers, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company has been slowly de-emphasizing its own line of wearables for the past several years, and has not mentioned wearables on its earnings calls since 2014. In November, TechCrunch reported that the company was planning to take a step back from the business after its acquisition of the Basis fitness watch didn't pan out as expected. Intel denied at the time that it was stepping back. But a source told CNBC that the chip maker in fact let go about 80 percent of the Basis group in November. Many of the people were given the opportunity to relocate to other parts of the business. About two weeks ago, Intel completely eliminated the group, this person said. The company's New Technologies Group, which looks at cutting-edge business areas, is now focusing on augmented reality, another source told CNBC. Intel once hoped that it would rule the wearables category alongside such players as Apple and Fitbit. Back in 2014, the company partnered with celebrities like 50 cent to show off its heart-rate sensing earbuds. Also in that year, it shelled out roughly $100 million for Basis. ""I want to be able to leave my phone at home,"" Intel CEO Brian Krzanich told reporters in January 2014 during a keynote the Consumer Electronics Show. ""We will get there."" On its web site, Intel continues to advertise its Curie chipset for connected Internet of Things devices, including wearables, alongside partnerships with watch makers like Tag Heuer.

Once the world’s biggest manufacturer of mobile network gear, Ericsson has been hit by competition from Huawei and Nokia while telecom operator spending has slumped ahead of the roll-out of next-generation 5G technology. Ericsson, which has cut costs and reorganized in response, said a restatement of its financials to reflect its new structure had uncovered the potential need for impairments. “If it turns out that we make an impairment of goodwill, we want to stress that it would not be due to the business in the (fourth) quarter but rather due to accounting matters,” Ericsson’s Chief Financial Officer Carl Mellander told Reuters. Ericsson said it will announce the outcome of its goodwill review before it publishes its fourth-quarter report. The segments Digital Services and Other, which houses its media business, had around 20 billion crowns ($2.35 billion) in goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets in the third quarter, versus around 45 billion for the group. Lars Soderfjell, portfolio manager at Alandsbanken who has no position in Ericsson shares, said he was not surprised by the move given the performance of the business. Ericsson’s Digital Services segment posted an operating loss excluding restructuring costs of 6.9 billion crowns in the first three quarters of the year while its Other segment made a loss of 4.1 billion crowns during the same period. Ericsson said an impairment would affect its operating income but not cashflow, adding that its cash position was strong and its shares were up 0.1 percent by 0955 GMT. This underperformed a 1.2 percent gain in the Stockholm blue chip index and a 1.1 percent rise in Nokia shares.

2016-07-26 19:15:00,2016,7.0,26,How the Chinese Government Became the World’s Hacking Superpower,"In January of 2010, Google made a shocking announcement: The Chinese government had broken into its systems to steal sensitive data.  This was the first time an American company had the guts to publicly stand up and point the finger at the government of China.  ""We detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google,"" the company wrote in a boringly titled blog post.  Those were different times. Six years later, a mantra among cybersecurity experts is that there's only two types of companies: those that have been hacked by China, and those that don't know they've been hacked yet.  Countless companies have accused China of hacking them. A whole industry has benefitted from this, offering defensive tools and forensics investigations to potential and actual victims. The reason why China has become such a superpower when it comes about hacking is because it wants to be the world's biggest superpower, and the fastest way to get to the top is steal secrets from the current leader.  But the current leader, the United States, has also decided to stand up. In 2014, the Department of Justice announced the indictment of five hackers who work for the country's military. The officers have practically no chance of ever seeing an American courthouse, but it was a way to make what's still the loudest stand against Chinese corporate espionage. Then, a year later, US and China announced a ceasefire of hacking operations, at least those against corporations. It was the beginning of a new era.  But that didn't stop all Chinese hacks. The worst one to date, perhaps, was that on the Office of Personnel Management or OPM, which resulted in the loss of more than 21 million personal records of government workers. The US government never publicly blamed China, but many anonymous US officials did in interviews with journalists.  This week, as part of VICELAND documentary series CYBERWAR, VICE Canada reporter Ben Makuch talks to the US government and the world's foremost experts on Chinese hacking, trying to trace the rise of the hacking giant.

2018-08-02 00:00:00,2018,8.0,2,China's Bytedance scrubs Musical.ly brand in favor of TikTok,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - China’s Beijing Bytedance Technology Co announced late Wednesday that it is shuttering the popular Musical.ly video app it acquired for nearly $1 billion in December and will move users to a revamped version of its homegrown competitor TikTok. Musical.ly, released in 2014, and TikTok, launched in 2016, both enable users to create and share short singing and dancing videos that are set to well-known songs, with numerous special effect filters. Although both apps were developed in China, Musical.ly became a sensation among teenagers in the Americas and Europe, while TikTok took off among youth in Asia. “Musical.ly and TikTok currently operate in complementary geographies without much overlap and as both platforms continue to grow rapidly now is the time to bring them together,” Stefan Heinrich, head of global marketing at TikTok, said in an email to Reuters. He said they are embracing the TikTok brand because it “better reflects the breadth of content created on our platform that extends beyond music to comedy, performance art and more. “Supporting one platform will allow us to expand our on-the-ground presence more quickly and easily – building local teams to support each market,” he said. Musical.ly recently reached 100 million monthly active users, according to the company. TikTok touted 500 million monthly active users in June. Bytedance has ridden the success of its news aggregation app Toutiao, to become one of the most highly valued startups in China’s red-hot tech sector. But the company has faced mounting scrutiny from China’s internet censors, with Toutiao temporarily taken off app stores for a cleanup in April while a separate joke app was permanently shut. TikTok had also been temporarily banned in Indonesia for inappropriate content. It maintains a separate app for China, known as Douyin. Alex Zhu, co-founder of musical.ly and senior vice president of TikTok, said in a press release: “Combining Musical.ly and TikTok is a natural fit given the shared mission of both experiences – to create a community where everyone can be a creator.” The new app will let users access content from new countries and viewing options that were only available on one of the apps, the company said in the release. Among new features is an alert for when users have spent more than two hours on the app, which is similar to an option social media giant Facebook introduced on Wednesday. The company said existing users’ accounts and content would be moved “to the new TikTok app,” which was expected to be available on app stores late Wednesday. Bytedance said in November that acquiring Musical.ly would help its users and advertisers tap into new markets. Last month, Musical.ly shut down Live.ly, a live streaming app it had developed before being acquired by Bytedance. The company told users to try out LiveMe, a rival app in which Bytedance is an investor. Reporting by Paresh Dave in San Francisco.

2017-04-28 00:00:00,2017,4.0,28,Mexican Congress approves use of medical marijuana,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s Lower House of Congress passed a bill on Friday to legalize the use of marijuana and cannabis for medical and scientific needs, a step closer to outright legalization in a country long scarred by warring drug cartels. The bill sailed through the Senate in December and will now be sent to President Enrique Pena Nieto, who is expected to sign it. “The ruling eliminates the prohibition and criminalization of acts related to the medicinal use of marijuana and its scientific research, and those relating to the production and distribution of the plant for these purposes,” the Lower House said in a statement on its website. The measure passed in a general floor vote with 371 in favor, seven against and 11 abstentions, and now classifies the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as “therapeutic.” Speaking in April 2016 at a special session where world leaders gathered to rethink global strategy in the war on drugs for the first time in two decades, Pena Nieto said drug use should be addressed as a “public health problem” and users should not be criminalized. Pena Nieto, once a vocal opponent of drug legalization, has said the United States and Mexico should not pursue diverging policies on marijuana legislation. Last year, he proposed a bill to allow Mexicans to carry up to an ounce of marijuana, a measure that has since stalled in Congress. Since a 2015 court ruling, the government has allowed the importation on a case-by-case basis of medicine with cannabidiol (CBD), an active chemical ingredient of the drug. Recreational marijuana is still broadly prohibited in Mexico, but in 2015 the Supreme Court granted four people the right to grow their own marijuana for personal consumption, opening the door to legalization.

2019-08-05 00:00:00,2019,8.0,5,Here's When Using a Fan Will Actually Make You Hotter,"Image:  haru__q (Flickr (CC BY-SA 2.0))Electric fan fans are in for some bittersweet news. A new study out Monday suggests that while fans can help people cool down on hot and humid days, in hot and arid environments they may actually make you more uncomfortable—and may even be unsafe.The researchers, based at the University of Sydney in Australia, recruited 12 healthy college-aged men for their experiment. The shorts-wearing men were asked to sit in a room for two hours at a time in four very unpleasant scenarios.Hot Pavement Is More Dangerous Than You RealizeDoctors at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas are warning about a less-recognized danger of summer …Read more ReadFor one pair of scenarios, the room was heated to 104 degrees Fahrenheit, with a relative humidity of 50 percent, amounting to a heat index (the temperature it actually feels like) of 132.8 degrees Fahrenheit. In the other scenarios, the room was heated to 116.6 degrees Fahrenheit, with a relative humidity of 10 percent, making for a lower heat index of 114.8 degrees Fahrenheit. Half the time, the men sat in front of a typical electric fan.Before and after the experiments, the men had their heart rate, sweat level, and body temperature measured (rectally, unfortunately), and they also reported how generally comfortable they felt.As you might expect, it wasn’t a great experience no matter which scenario it was. But the men did report feeling twice as comfortable in the hot, humid room when the fan was on than when it wasn’t. Their body temperature and level of cardiac stress was slightly lower when the fan was on, though they did sweat more, increasing the risk of dehydration.But when the fan was on in the hot and dry room, the men fared worse on every measure compared to the no-fan scenario, despite the room “feeling” less hot than the high-heat-and-humidity version.Currently, organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency advise that people not use fans when the heat index is over our body temperature, or 99 degrees Fahrenheit. The logic goes that fans can actually cause more strain on the body at that temperature and above, by blasting us with air warmer than our skin and making us hotter through convection. But the study’s results, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, seem to show that relying on heat index alone might not be the best way to tell if using a fan is helpful, according to the authors.“These findings highlight issues that may arise when [heat index] values are used to recommend fan use during heat waves,” they wrote.The study’s conclusions should be taken with some guarded skepticism, as even the authors admit. Twelve volunteers is not a lot of people for a study, and two hours isn’t a lot of time to base a comparison on. We also can’t be sure these effects would be seen, and to what extent, in other groups of people. Perhaps for people who are taking certain medications, or who just came back from a workout, fans might affect them differently during either kind of hot day.Still, there might be some room for comfort for people living in areas where hot and humid summers are the norm, but air conditioners are not. In areas such as the South Central United States, South Australia, and the Middle East, where heat waves tend to be relatively dry, fans might not be advisable, the authors wrote.“However, in much of the remainder of the United States, Southeast Asia, South America, and Europe, temperatures rarely exceed [104 degrees Fahrenheit] but are accompanied by moderately high humidity,” they added. “In these regions, fans could be encouraged as a cheaper and accessible alternative to air conditioning that also limits net electricity demand and carbon pollution.”",https://gizmodo.com/heres-when-using-a-fan-will-actually-make-you-hotter-1836979471,Health,Gizmodo,health,623

The reason was a shortfall in the company's More Personal Computing segment, which includes Windows and hardware like the Surface tablets, booked $8.84 billion in revenue — well behind average expectations of $9.22 billion (according to StreetAccount), and down 7% from last year. Surface revenue dropped 26% to $831 million, its lowest figure in more than a year, in part because of more competition from other similar devices and ahead of expected new models expected out later this year. On a call with CNBC, Microsoft said the shortfall was specifically due to ""lower than expected Surface Pro unit volume,"" but noted that one big reason for that product is to spur growth of similar ""2-in-1"" devices (combo tablet-laptops) across the entire industry. Microsoft said it was encouraged by sales of devices from other manufacturers — revenue from sales of Windows to other manufacturers was up 5% in constant currency, ahead of the overall PC market. Operating expenses jumped 12% from last year's quarter, to $8.4 billion, due in large part to the acquisition of LinkedIn. This was the first full quarter in which LinkedIn was part of Microsoft, and it drove $965 million in operating expenses, including $153 million in amortization of intangibles — a term that usually covers things like goodwill, trademarks, or brand value.

2017-08-11 18:48:00,2017,8.0,11,The FCC Is Using an Obsolete Loophole to Help a Pro-Trump Media Company Take Over Local TV,"President Trump's administration has had a stormy relationship with the US news media, to put it mildly. He has repeatedly disparaged reporters, branded legitimate journalism as ""fake news,"" and even described media organizations as ""the enemy of the American people."" But the Trump administration's hostility to the media is hardly universal. In fact, Trump's top telecom regulator is in the process of delivering a major gift to a media organization that has consistently showered the president with positive coverage, by paving the way for a merger that could dramatically increase that company's national reach. Earlier this year, Sinclair Broadcast Group, the nation's largest television station operator by coverage, announced plans to buy Tribune Media, another large TV station operator, in a $3.9 billion deal that would create a national broadcasting juggernaut with more than 230 stations reaching 72 percent of households across the country. Sinclair has drawn criticism for forcing its local stations—which include FOX, NBC, ABC and CBS affiliates—to air one-sided and fawning commentary about the president, including by Boris Epshteyn, a former Trump aide who is now Sinclair's chief political analyst. Until recently, such a merger would have faced long odds, because the deal would have violated federal media ownership rules that prohibit a single company from owning TV stations that reach more than 39 percent of the nation's audience. Those rules are designed to advance federally mandated goals of media diversity, localism, and competition, and to prevent any one media company from becoming too powerful. But in April, Trump's Federal Communications Commission chief, Republican Ajit Pai, pushed through a measure that will allow the Sinclair-Tribune merger to proceed. Pai accomplished this by reinstating an obsolete loophole called the ""UHF discount,"" which allows broadcasters to discount by 50 percent the reach of local stations that use ultra-high-frequency (UHF) TV signals. The practical result of Pai's action is to make it easier for TV station owners like Sinclair and Tribune to merge. That prospect has drawn withering criticism from public interest advocates at a time when many media experts are warning about out-of-control corporate consolidation in the media industry. ""No one company should have such power over the news and information that citizens must have to successfully practice the art of self-government,"" Michael Copps, former FCC Commissioner and Special Adviser at public interest group Common Cause, said in a recent statement about the Sinclair-Tribune deal. ""And that doesn't even get into the vices of this particular company."" What is the UHF discount? The UHF discount is an obsolete relic of a pre-digital TV era in which consumers received over-the-air analog television signals via old-school rabbit-ear antennas. Those broadcast signals were classified as VHF (very-high-frequency), which comprised Channels 2-13, and UHF (ultra-high-frequency), which comprised Channel 14 and above. Due to their shorter wavelengths, UHF signals cannot travel through the air as far—nor propagate as well through walls and humans—as VHF signals. Over-the-air UHF signals are also more prone to interference than VHF signals. That's why, as a historical matter, Channels 2-13 were generally more powerful than higher channels, and why those spots on the TV ""dial"" were occupied by affiliates of the traditional ""Big 3"" TV networks. For example, in New York City, CBS is available on Channel 2, NBC on Channel 4, and ABC on Channel 7. The higher channels were often the domain of less powerful, low-budget broadcasters of the ""public access"" variety. As a result of this disparity in the relative ""strength"" between VHF and UHF signals, broadcasters using the latter were allowed to ""discount"" by 50% the reach of these stations for the purposes of federal media ownership rules. As a practical matter, this meant that broadcast TV owners could exceed federal media ownership limits by ""discounting"" the reach of UHF stations as compared to VHF stations. Years ago, the UHF-discount made sense, but it doesn't anymore, because the 2009 transition of over-the-air television to digital broadcasting made UHF stations equal in quality to VHF stations. So what was Pai's rationale for reinstating the UHF discount? The chairman argued that the FCC had erred in removing the discount without simultaneously considering changes to the 39% national broadcast ownership cap, which he wants to raise. Pai's action faced fierce criticism from opponents of media consolidation, including Democratic FCC commissioner Mignon Clyburn, who warned that reinstating the UHF discount would allow a small group of big TV station owners to get even bigger. ""The Commission just wrapped up and put a bow on a huge gift for those large broadcasters with ambitious dreams of more consolidation,"" Clyburn said at the FCC's April meeting. ""Now I am not a betting woman, but mark my word: This Order will have an immediate impact on the purchase and sale of television stations."" What is Sinclair Broadcast Group? Maryland-based Sinclair Broadcast Group is the second largest TV station owner in the country, with 173 stations in dozens of US markets, and is the largest station owner by geographic reach. Among Sinclair's holdings are dozens of FOX, NBC, CBS, and ABC affiliates across the country. A publicly traded company, Sinclair is controlled by the sons of the company's founder, Julian Sinclair Smith, who died in 1993. For years, Sinclair has faced criticism for the conservative slant of its news programming. In many cases, this programming is not produced locally, but instead consists of ""must run"" stories and editorials that that the company requires all of its stations to broadcast. Among other controversies, Sinclair ordered its stations in 2004 to air a documentary critical of then-presidential candidate John Kerry's Vietnam War record. Also that year, Sinclair ordered seven of its stations not to run an ABC News Nightline report on Iraq War casualties that highlighted the human toll of the conflict. In 2010, several Sinclair stations broadcast what critics called an ""infomercial"" funded by a Republican political action committee that made several incendiary claims against President Obama, including that he was a ""socialist"" who had raised money from Hamas. In 2012, Sinclair again faced controversy for forcing many of its stations to run an election-eve special that was criticized as being unfairly harsh toward Obama. In December 2016, The Washington Post reported that a ""review of Sinclair's reporting and internal documents shows a strong tilt toward Trump."" The Post's analysis showed that ""Sinclair gave a disproportionate amount of neutral or favorable coverage to Trump during the campaign while often casting Clinton in an unfavorable light."" That report followed news that the Trump campaign struck an agreement with Sinclair that offered the company exclusive access to key campaign personnel in hopes of receiving ""straighter"" coverage. At the time, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner noted that Sinclair reaches more people than CNN in many states: ""It's math,"" he said. In April, Sinclair hired former Trump aide and cable news surrogate Boris Epshteyn to be the company's ""chief political analyst."" Some public interest advocates see a connection between Sinclair's pro-Trump stance and the Trump FCC's efforts to create the conditions for the company to grow even larger. ""Sure looks like a quid pro quo: friendly coverage and full employment for ex-Trump mouthpieces in exchange for a green light to get as big as Sinclair wants,"" Craig Aaron, CEO of DC-based public interest group Free Press, said in a May statement. ""This deal would have been DOA in any other administration, but the Trump FCC isn't just approving it; they're practically arranging it."" For his part, Pai denies that his move to reinstate the UHF discount is designed to smooth the merger's path forward. ""If you look at our regulatory actions, they're not designed to benefit any company or segment of the industry,"" Pai told Congress during a recent Capitol Hill hearing. The final deadline for the American public to file reply comments with the FCC on Sinclair's proposed merger with Tribune (Docket No. 17-179) is August 29, 2017.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/paadj8/the-fcc-is-using-an-obsolete-loophole-to-help-a-pro-trump-media-company-take-over-local-tv,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,1310

2017-05-13 00:00:00,2017,5.0,13,Microsoft issues ‘highly unusual’ Windows XP patch to prevent massive ransomware attack,"UK hospitals, Telefonica, FedEx, and other businesses were hit by a massive ransomware attack on Friday. Around 75,000 computers in 99 countries were affected by malware known as WannaCry, which encrypts a computer and demands a $300 ransom before unlocking it. The malware was able to spread thanks to flaws in old versions of Windows that were originally used by the NSA to hack into PCs before being made public by the Shadow Brokers group last month. While Microsoft quickly issued fixes for the latest versions of Windows last month, this left Windows XP unprotected. Many of the machines attacked today have been breached simply because the latest Windows updates have not been applied quickly enough, but there are still organizations that continue to run Windows XP despite the risks. Microsoft is now taking what it describes as a ""highly unusual"" step to provide public patches for Windows operating systems that are in custom support only. This includes specific fixes for Windows XP, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2003. Microsoft usually charges businesses to provide custom support agreements for older versions of Windows, which include critical and important software updates from Microsoft beyond the normal end of extended support point. ""Seeing businesses and individuals affected by cyberattacks, such as the ones reported today, was painful,"" explains Phillip Misner, a security group manager at Microsoft. ""Given the potential impact to customers and their businesses, we made the decision to make the Security Update for platforms in custom support only."" It's an unusual move for Microsoft, but this security flaw and the way it was discovered and made public is equally unusual. There are now signs that the ransomware attack has subsided thanks to a kill switch, discovered by a 22-year-old in the UK. Some experts believe the attackers behind the ransomware have only raised around $20,000 from the scam. Either way, this is yet another painful security lesson for everyone involved. Exploits should be disclosed by government agencies, systems should be patched in a timely manner, and nobody should be running an old supported version of Windows.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/13/microsoft-issues-highly-unusual-windows-xp-patch-to-prevent-massive-ransomware-attack.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,346

2017-05-03 00:00:00,2017,5.0,3,Now seems like a good time to ask what a smartwatch is,"What is a smartwatch? I’m not asking this question in the literal sense; if I was, I’d be ill-equipped to have written as many smartwatch articles and reviews as I have over the past five years. A lot of us know what a smartwatch is conceptually; at the very least, there’s a vague sense among the general public that a smartwatch is somehow smarter, the way a smartphone is smart, and that techies like to wear them. But with so many connected watches selling now, what actually makes a smartwatch a smartwatch? Is it a specific operating system? The ability to run third-party apps? Or it is simply a watch that can show you notifications from your smartphone? If that’s the case: does it have to look like a watch? Or is a Fitbit a smartwatch ? Fitbit’s Blaze might best exemplify a product that’s stuck between two product categories, which only underscores that the category itself is still undefined. Fitbit was careful to market the Blaze as a “smart fitness watch” when it first announced it in January 2016. It looks like a smartwatch, it shows notifications like a smartwatch, it has the touchscreen of a smartwatch, but it wasn’t a “smartwatch.” Why not? Fitbit might not have presented it that way because the watch doesn’t run third-party apps the way an Apple Watch or an Android Wear watch does. Or, maybe Fitbit just didn’t want to go head-to-head with Apple — not that Fitbit’s intentions mattered at all once Wall Street (correctly) assessed that Fitbit was going head-to-head with Apple. But if third-party apps are the differentiator — that difference between, say, a connected Garmin watch with a transflective display that only runs its own exercise apps, and an Android Wear watch that runs a bunch of different apps on its bright touchscreen display — then what does that say about Apple Watch, the Fortune 500-sized business that has been losing support from key app makers like Google, Amazon, and eBay? If those third-party apps don’t matter, and the things that matter are the core functions of the watch like time-telling, messaging, fitness-tracking, and payment-making, then wouldn’t that make so many other connected watches “smartwatches,” too? Does that mean a connected Fossil watch, or a Withings watch, is a “smartwatch”? I realize I’m posing more questions than I’m answering here, but it’s because the category really is messy at the moment, as small as it may be relative to the PC or smartphone market. I’ve been informally surveying industry insiders about what they think makes a “smartwatch,” and have been surprised by some answers. Recently Ray Maker, of the DC Rainmaker blog, joined the Too Embarrassed to Ask podcast and we geeked out over wearables for over an hour. When I asked him what he considers to be a smartwatch, Maker first acknowledged that the “definition keeps on changing for everyone,” but that he ultimately considers a smartwatch “anything I get notifications on.” Cardiogram co-founder Brandon Ballinger says he thinks a smartwatch is something with an app platform. He thinks that people are still “figuring out which apps suit the format.” He points out that Word or Excel were popular PC apps, but don’t make sense on an iPhone, and that it took a few years for Instagram or Uber to emerge. “We’re still figuring out what the Instagram of Apple Watch will be,” Ballinger concluded. Of course, Cardiogram is an app for Apple Watch, so it makes sense that he would feel that a smartwatch should support third-party apps. Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies, says that for her the “smartness” of a smartwatch isn’t necessarily reliant on the apps ecosystem. Instead, it’s “the combination of sensors that either help with fitness or context — say in a smart home environment — and notifications … It complements the phone rather than duplicate it.” Other analysts and research firms don’t necessarily help clear up the matter. If you look at this late-December report from IDC, which is usually a good place to start, the firm broadly establishes the category as “wearables,” makes separate mentions of the “smartwatch” and “fitness band” categories, and then lumps companies like Xiaomi, Garmin, and Apple in the same group. These companies all make things that go on your wrist. But some are arguably “smartwatches,” and some are definitely not. (Things get even more confusing when you consider that Gartner also puts VR glasses / head-mounted displays into the “wearables” category.) Update: Jitesh Ubrani, a senior analyst at IDC, later clarified that the firm’s stance has been that smartwatches must have the ability to run third-party apps. “We include other wearables because consumers don't look at smartwatches in a vacuum,” Ubrani said. Personally, I tend to agree with Ballinger that the difference between a smartwatch and a watch that has some smart features, is that a smartwatch at least has the potential to run third-party apps. Think of Pebble (RIP Pebble): no one questioned if that was a smartwatch; it ran on its own OS, and developers made apps for it. As of today, though, I have yet to experience that one app — the Instagram — that makes me think I can’t live without a smartwatch, so I place more value on the core functions of a watch, like the fitness-tracking and battery life of a Garmin or the notifications of an Apple or Android Wear watch. It’s also very possible that the reason why we can’t all agree on a definition of a smartwatch is because it doesn’t exist yet in its most obvious, platonic form. After all, the BlackBerry was arguably a smartphone, but it hardly seemed like one once a “real” smartphone changed the entire category. To compare the current crop of smartwatches to PDAs, though, is both optimistic and foreboding: it means there’s still an opportunity to blow up the smartwatch market, still room for tremendous growth. But if that’s the case, then who is the BlackBerry in this scenario?",https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/3/15530698/what-is-a-smartwatch-debate-apps-fitness-tracking-poll,Tech,The Verge,technology,1002
2017-08-26 00:00:00,2017,8.0,26,Food delivery creates tech headache for some U.S. restaurants,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Four tablets from various delivery companies crowd the front counter of Proposition Chicken in San Francisco, each calling out with its own ring when an order arrives. When there is a ping, a cashier finds the right tablet and then retypes the order into the restaurant’s own system, which tells the kitchen to start cooking. “It’s a dance up there,” said co-owner Maxwell Cohen. “It takes a lot of training and some getting used to, juggling the orders coming in from the various iPads, the customers in line and the phone ringing.” Cohen’s “juggling” reflects a challenge for the burgeoning food delivery industry, a group of independent companies including Grubhub, UberEATS and DoorDash. While hungry consumers can find and order a meal in a single click, delivery technology can complicate work inside restaurants, and some restaurant owners are slimming down their counters in response. On-demand food delivery has exploded in the last few years, with more than three dozen startups getting initial funding since 2011, according to data firm CB Insights. U.S. restaurants saw $16.5 billion of delivery sales in the year ending June 2017, and non-pizza delivery traffic was up 33 percent in 2015 versus 2012, according to the NPD Group/CREST. Cohen likes the extra sales, which account for about 10 percent to 15 percent of business. But he will forego outside delivery at a new location opening in nearby Oakland. In-house orders are more profitable and less of a headache, given commissions restaurateurs say reach 10 percent to 30 percent of an order, plus the need for extra staff. “The challenge with delivery isn’t just delivery itself,” said Brendan Witcher, an analyst with Forrester. “(It’s) about being able to have the restaurant say ‘I don’t know how we ever did business before this service.’” Brian Reccow, a partner at Presidio Pizza Company in San Francisco, said he plans to “cull the herd” of delivery tablets on the restaurant’s counter. Since costs have risen along with sales, he does not see a profit boost from the deliveries, just better publicity. Venture investors poured $2.5 billion into on-demand delivery companies last year, according to a Reuters analysis. But investor enthusiasm has waned and the market has continued to consolidate as smaller players are acquired or shut down, according to CB Insights. Brook Porter, a partner with venture capital group G2VP, a spinoff of Silicon Valley investment firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, said that delivery companies should focus on a type of food or part of the market to distinguish themselves. “Or,” Porter said, “you need to have some substantial technology advantage that gives you a lower cost to operate and to deliver.” Grubhub and its Seamless unit accounted for more than half of the top companies’ delivery sales in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to market analytics firm 1010data. Eat24, which Grubhub is buying, Uber Technologies Inc’s UberEATS and DoorDash follow, with UberEATS growing the fastest of the group. Grubhub Chief Operating Officer Stan Chia sees the future in sending orders straight to restaurants’ computers. NCR Corp, a provider of point-of-sale software that restaurants use to handle orders, recently announced partnerships with Doordash and Grubhub. An automated process is exactly what Charles Bililies, owner of Greek eatery Souvla in San Francisco needed. He chose a single delivery company, Square Inc’s Caviar, which brings in about a quarter of sales and sends orders directly to the kitchen. “We had kind of gone on some first and second dates with some other delivery companies,” he said. “We were actually on multiple platforms at the same time, and for us it just got to be far too cumbersome.” Editing by Peter Henderson and Diane Craft",https://www.reuters.com/article/restaurants-deliver/food-delivery-creates-tech-headache-for-some-us-restaurants-idUSL2N1LB17S,Technology News,Reuters,technology,618
2017-03-22 00:00:00,2017,3.0,22,Hotel booking platform HotelTonight raises $37 million,"(Reuters) - Last-minute U.S. hotel booking app HotelTonight said on Wednesday it raised $37 million in a funding round as it seeks to expand its international hotel network and invest in marketing campaigns. The Series E funding round, which was led by venture capital firm Accel Partners and valued the profitable San Francisco-based company at roughly $500 million, brings it one step forward to an eventual initial public offering, though the company has yet to outline such plans. Users of HotelTonight can use the app to book hotels up to a week in advance, often at a discount. It has 25,000 hotel partners in more than 30 countries, which unload their unused rooms onto the platform. HotelTonight is counting on its sleek mobile interface to compete against its much larger booking competitor, Expedia Inc (EXPE.O). Earlier this year, HotelTonight secured a partnership with U.K. soccer team Chelsea F.C. The company’s other investors include Battery Ventures, US Venture Partners, GGV Capital, Coatue Management and First Round Capital, which also invested in the most recent round.

2020-02-11 00:00:00,2020,2.0,11,Rihanna's lingerie brand accused of deceptive marketing,"Truth in Advertising, a nonprofit advertising watchdog, has filed deceptive marketing complaints with the FTC and California regulators against Savage X Fenty, Rihanna's lingerie brand. Savage X Fenty has drawn millions in investment funding and has been lauded for its inclusive sizing and diverse marketing. But Truth in Advertising alleges that the lingerie company deceptively promotes discounts and prices that are only available to consumers who are part of the company's membership program, without clearly disclosing that fact in its marketing. It says consumers are enrolled by the company into an ""Xtra VIP Membership"" without clearly disclosing terms and conditions, like needing to ""take affirmative action every month to avoid recurring monthly charges."" CNBC reviewed the site and found that prices for items defaulted to ""VIP"" pricing, without giving the option to purchase for a ""regular"" price. When navigating to the shopping bag, if an item had been added, a ""Savage X Monthly Membership"" was also added automatically, without changing the pricing. The only way of knowing that membership would result in more charges is by clicking a small ""Learn More"" button that explains it would incur a $49.95 monthly charge, or by reading a description to the right of the checkout options. Screenshot from FTC complaint The complaint also says the retailer employs ""dissuasion and diversion tactics"" to make it difficult for consumers to cancel their memberships, and that it tells consumers that monthly charges can be used as store credit, but that they can't unless they spend $49.95 or more. According to the complaint, the company advertises on social media including Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube, using its own channels, buying ads and using influencers. Screenshot from FTC complaint The FTC complaint also alleges that many of Fenty's influencers don't disclose their material connections to the company. The organization said it has ""identified a sampling of 70 social media posts by 21 different influencers that deceptively advertise Savage X Fenty products. These posts do not have adequate disclosures of the influencers' material connections to the company either by failing to include any disclosure at all, using inadequate and unclear language to disclose the relationship, or placing the disclosure in a place that will easily be overlooked by consumers."" In an email to CNBC sent Tuesday night, Savage X Fenty's Senior Director of Brand and Communications Emma Tully said the company believes it is compliant with consumer protection laws and has not received inquiries from the FTC. She said ""while we wouldn't typically issue a public response, we are because these accusations are false and based on misconceptions of our business."" Tully said the company is ""proud of [its] flexible membership program because it allows us to offer unparalleled quality and value to our customers"" and claims it has a high Net Promoter Score and an ""A"" rating from the Better Business Bureau. She said the company provides ""multiple disclosures of membership terms"" in the shopping experience and in ads, and claimed customers can cancel ""at any time"" online using a live chat or on the phone. ""While we take all feedback seriously, we believe strongly that we are compliant with consumer protection laws,"" she wrote. Fenty's parent company, TechStyle Fashion Group, has drawn scrutiny over similar practices in the past. The company, previously called JustFab Inc., received a torrent of complaints several years ago for ""VIP Membership"" subscription-style models, which critics say don't make clear when a consumer is signing up for a recurring monthly payment. JustFab paid $1.8 million to settle a consumer protection lawsuit for misleading advertising in 2014. Its brands also include Kate Hudson's Fabletics (which has received similar complaints, outlined in a 2015 BuzzFeed investigation) and Shoedazzle. The complaint sent to Santa Cruz County District Attorney's Office in California alleges that TechStyle is violating the 2014 stipulated judgment it entered into with the State of California, which prohibits the company and its partners from making untrue or misleading statements about products or services, deceptively marketing product prices and discounts only available to consumers who are bound by the company's VIP membership, among other practices. Representatives for Savage X Fenty, TechStyle, the FTC and the Santa Cruz County District Attorney's office didn't immediately respond for requests for comment.",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/11/rihannas-lingerie-brand-accused-of-deceptive-marketing.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,703
2016-03-24 17:45:00,2016,3.0,24,The Simplest Living Organism Ever Has 437 Genes and Was Made in a Laboratory,"If synthetic biology has a rockstar, it's Craig Venter, and he's back with a new hit. Venter and his team say they've created one of the simplest organisms theoretically possible using a combination of genetic engineering techniques, in-lab DNA-synthesis, and trial-and-error. The work, published Thursday in Science, describes a self-replicating bacterium invented by Venter and his team that contains just 437 genes, a ""genome smaller than that of any autonomously replicating cell found in nature,"" according to the paper. The work sheds light on the function of the individual genes necessary to have life, and it also shows us just how little we actually know about specific gene functions. ""We have long been interested in simplifying the genomic software of a bacterial cell by eliminating genes that are nonessential for cell growth under ideal conditions in the laboratory,"" Venter wrote in the paper. ""This facilitates the goal of achieving an understanding of the molecular and biological function of every gene that is essential for life."" A study published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information in 1995 suggested that a genome that coded the most basic lifeform would be roughly 256 genes. Venter said in a conference call with reporters that ""everybody was off—by a third."" The team says that 149 of the genes have unknown functions, but were nonetheless necessary for the organism to grow and replicate. For comparison, E. Coli and other well-understood genes have roughly 5,000 genes. ""We now know, in the end result, that 32 percent of the genes required for life in this most simple of all organisms are of unknown function,"" Venter said. ""If we don't understand the functions of a third of those genes—you know we're also involved in depth in analyzing the human genome with 20,000-some-odd genes, most of which we have no known function for. So I think these findings are very humbling in that regard."" So what does this all mean? Venter says his team and others will now work on identifying the purpose of some of the genes with unknown functions, and Daniel Gibson, a researcher who works at the J. Craig Venter Institute said that this work will ultimately lead to the creation of synthetic life with specific purposes, such as producing cheap biofuel and creating new medicines. ""Our long-term vision has been to design and build synthetic organisms on demand, where you can add in specific functions and predict what the outcome is going to be,"" Gibson said. You may remember Venter as one of the leaders of the Human Genome Project, or the first scientist to ever transfer a synthetic genome into a living cell and have it continue to function (the first synthetic life ever, many argue). He's also friends with Elon Musk, with whom he casually talks about printing synthetic life on Mars to terraform the planet, and he's cofounder of Human Longevity, which is dedicated to extending the human lifespan using genetics. These new findings make his more outlandish claims seem ever so slightly more attainable, but it's important to recognize just how painstaking and slow this work was. Venter says he's been working on the project off and on for 20 years, and that, essentially, the organism he's dubbed JCBI Syn 3.0 was the result of some very sophisticated trial-and-error. At first, the team tried to model life using computer software alone, but found that when they actually went to synthesize the organism, it never worked. ""Every one of our designs failed,"" he said. And so the team took its original synthetic life, called SYN 1.0, and started knocking out and adding back in genes as necessary. The team found that it would regularly knock out a gene it thought to be ""inessential,"" only to find that, when they knocked out an analogous gene, the bacterium couldn't survive. Venter likened it to a Boeing 747 plane—you can take out one engine and have it still fly, but if you take out both, the plane crashes. ""That's what happened over and over again, where we would have what appeared to be a non-essential component until we removed its counterpart,"" he said. Only genes that were required for the bacterium to survive—not those that are required for it to thrive, such as specific growth genes—were included. Venter noted that, though this is a ""minimal"" bacterial genome, it is not necessarily the minimum, because other types of life may exist, and a couple of growth-related genes were kept in because it ""had to grow at a sufficient pace to be a good experimental model."" ""A typical experiment took three months, and so this study would have taken probably another five years if we didn't insist on rapid growth,"" he said. We're still in the early days of synthetic biology, and it's anyone's guess when truly synthetic life will be used in an applied sense versus a lets-learn-more-about-the-basics-of-life sense, but increasingly impressive feats are being accomplished on a semi-yearly basis at this point. Venter created the first artificial life in 2010; in 2014, Floyd Romesberg of the Scripps Research Institute created synthetic life using DNA base pairs that are not found in nature; and genetic editing tools like CRISPR-Cas9 are being used in laboratories big and small to fundamentally alter DNA. These findings suggest that the definition of ""life"" is actively changing as we manipulate its code. It's no surprise, then, that in the paper Venter regularly refers to the ""genome"" as ""a piece of software."" ""We view life as DNA software-driven,"" Venter said. ""And we're showing that by trying to understand that software, we're going to get better understandings of life.""

2017-04-10 00:00:00,2017,4.0,10,"Of course, a bunch of Twitter users want to buy the company and turn it into a co-op","Here's a potential Twitter acquirer you may not have considered: The service's own users. Last fall, when Twitter was considering a sale, a group of Twitter diehards started a petition encouraging the company to sell itself to its users, which would essentially turn Twitter into a co-op. Sounds crazy? The movement garnered enough attention that a proposal to explore the co-op idea has made it onto the official agenda for the company's annual shareholder meeting set to take place in May. If the proposal passes, it would require Twitter to ""prepare a report on the nature and feasibility of selling the platform to its users,"" according to Twitter's proxy filing submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission last week. In other words, Twitter needs to look into the idea, although that doesn't mean it would ever actually happen. Not surprisingly, Twitter's board is not keen on selling the company to its customers. ""We believe that preparing a report on the nature and feasibility of selling the 'platform,' and doing so only to 'its users,' would be a misallocation of resources and a distraction to our board of directors and management,"" the company argued in the proxy. Still, the co-op idea is, at the very least, intriguing to think about. Twitter is a service that often feels like it's dominated by a highly-dedicated, vocal minority. Twitter's social impact vastly outweighs its business impact, and supporters of the co-op idea believe that if users owned the company, the pressure to produce quarter-over-quarter growth would be diminished. Twitter could simply focus on building a better product with more direct input from its user base. ""Wall Street thinks the company is a failure, because it's not raking in enough profit for shareholders,"" the petition reads. ""That means that Twitter is up for sale, and there is a real risk that the new owner may ruin our beloved platform with a narrow pursuit of profit or political gains."" How might a Twitter co-op actually work, though? Nathan Schneider, who first proposed the co-op idea in an op-ed for The Guardian last fall, believes there are a number of different formats that could work, which is why he wants the company to look into options. One idea would be a hybrid ownership model, Schneider suggested to Recode, where a portion of the voting shares would be set aside into a trust controlled by actual users; those shares would also control a few board seats. He pointed to the Associated Press, a not-for-profit cooperative, as a successful example of the co-op idea working in the real world. ""It struck me that this [Twitter sale process] was a spectator sport and what was up for grabs was a valuable entity,"" Schneider explained in an interview with Recode. ""[The idea] isn't to blow up everything. Shared ownership of this kind is really the best path for Twitter."" Almost 3,500 people have signed the petition, but it seems highly unlikely the proposal will get the majority of votes required for it pass, especially considering Twitter's board has openly opposed it. There's also this argument: Twitter's one-vote-per-share stock structure already provides users with a chance to ""own"" the company and have a say in how it's run. That's why this co-op proposal even made it on the agenda in the first place. Oh, and this one: Twitter, despite its struggles, is still worth more than $10 billion. Not exactly pocket change. The NFL's Green Bay Packers, which is often pointed to as a shining example of a ""user""-owned entity, has an estimated value of just $2.3 billion. —By Kurt Wagner, Recode.net.

2016-12-15 00:00:00,2016,12.0,15,"Study finds UK sugar tax could save thousands from obesity, diabetes","LONDON (Reuters) - A planned levy on sugary drinks due to be introduced in Britain in April 2018 could significantly reduce the number of people who become obese and develop diabetes and tooth decay, scientists said on Thursday. In a study on the levy’s health impacts, researchers found the positive effect would be greatest if the drinks industry responds by reformulating products to cut sugar content, rather than keep the same formulations but raise prices to consumers. The planned levy is tiered, starting from no tax on diet and low sugar drinks, a low tax on mid-sugar drinks containing 5 to 8 grams (g) of sugar per 100 millilitres (ml), and a high tax on very sugary drinks containing 8g or more per 100 ml. The government’s health department says sugary drinks are the single biggest source of sugar for children, who can have more than their recommended daily intake just by drinking a can of cola, which has nine teaspoons of sugar. The scientists studied three possible reactions by companies to the levy. They could reformulate drinks to reduce sugar content, pass some of the levy to consumers by raising the price of sugary drinks, or use marketing to encourage consumers to switch to lower sugar drinks. The Lancet Public Health journal published the results. For each scenario, the researchers mapped a realistic better and worse case scenario for health by estimating the likely impact on rates of obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. “The good news is that our study suggests that all of the most likely industry responses ... have the potential to improve health,” said Adam Briggs of Oxford University, who led the study. “The extent of the health benefits of the tax will depend on industry’s response.” In opting for a sugar tax, Britain joins Belgium, France, Hungary and Mexico, all of which have imposed some form of tax on drinks with added sugar. Scandinavian countries have levied similar taxes for many years. According to the study’s modeling, a 30 percent reduction in sugar content of all high-sugar drinks and a 15 percent reduction in mid-sugar drinks could result in 14,400 fewer adults and children with obesity, 19,000 fewer cases of type 2 diabetes a year, and 26,900 fewer decaying teeth annually. Passing on half of the cost of the levy to consumers with a price rise for high and mid-sugar drinks of up to 20 percent could reduce the number of adults and children with obesity by 81,600, result in 10,800 fewer diabetes cases and 14,900 fewer decaying teeth a year. Speaking to reporters at a briefing in London, Briggs and his team said the most likely real-life response from industry would probably involve a combination of the scenarios in the study, which might mean the benefits could increase. “The direction of the effect is clear,” said Susan Jebb, an Oxford professor who co-led the research. “This levy will have a positive impact, especially on children’s health.” Reporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Tom Heneghan",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-sugar-levy-idUSKBN1442ZO,Health News,Reuters,health,500

""I feel we have taken down another great icon,"" Draper said on CNBC's ""Closing Bell.""

2016-09-07 14:05:00,2016,9.0,7,Human-Robot Relationships Will Never Make the Leap From Sex to Love,"Could a robot designed as a sexual companion ever feel something like love for me? And could I, as a human with emotional intelligence, ever feel love for it? These questions challenge our definition of love, but they also challenge our understanding of both human emotion and artificial intelligence. Will intimate relationships between humans and robots ever get beyond just sex?  This is a topic up for debate at the 12th Human Choice and Computers Conference in Manchester, UK, where academics and researchers are gathering this week to discuss humanity's relationship—sexual, romantic, or otherwise—with our AI counterparts.  Sex robots have been a thing for a few years now, increasingly nudging up the realism spectrum as AI, robotics, and manufacturing methods advance. No longer in the realm of science fiction (à la Pris Stratton, the ""basic pleasure model"" in Blade Runner), your very own lovable robotic companion is just a few mouse clicks away.  But in 2016, when artificial intelligence can beat a human in a game tougher than chess, you still have to pre-programme even the most advanced of available ""sex robots"" with a personality. True Companion's RoxxxyGold comes with a base personality so she ""likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike""—but for anything resembling emotional variety, extra personalities such as ""Frigid Farrah"" or ""S&M Susan"" have to be bought and installed.  So, will these robots ever be able to transcend their soulless form, with the help of artificial intelligence, and provide a more loving form of companionship, something akin to that shown in Spike Jonze's Her and Alex Garland's Ex Machina? Will a sex robot ever love me, and I, in return, love it?  Charles Ess, professor of media studies at the University of Oslo and keynote speaker at the conference, thinks that the answer is an unequivocal negative.  ""As far as I can tell, the consensus in the AI and robotic communities is, in a strong sense, no,"" Ess told Motherboard in an interview. Ess, who has a background in applied ethics and philosophy, tackles the question with an armoury of philosophical definitions of love.  ""Because to love you, or anyone else, requires what philosophers like to call 'first person phenomenal consciousness'—basically the capacity to be aware of oneself and to be aware of one having emotions and desires,"" he continued. ""The current state of the art, and what I've seen of projections, all point to no. For example, there's an expert group located in Stanford that's going to issue a report before the end of the month, and their prognosis for 2030 is also 'no'. They think we're just not going to have that kind of consciousness [in robots].""  Ess predicts, in notions parallel to the robots already on the market today, that what buyers will be left with are essentially zombies.  ""So if you don't have that kind of consciousness, and you don't have that kind of real emotion, a sort of blunt image of what you have is a zombie. It knows how to move, it can imitate emotion very well,"" he said. ""Robots can already do that and are getting better, so they can evoke a sense of feeling on your side, and this is the basic trick. There's a whole subfield in robotics called artificial emotions.""  Artificial emotions could work wonders in a therapeutic sense, but are no match for the real thing.  ""There are circumstances in which that's perfectly fine. But in the long run what we want is to be genuinely loved and desired for who we are as a complete and embodied person,"" said Ess. ""Robots will be able to fake that, but you and I will know because we bought them, or we rented them, that it's a fake.""  For some, this is good news. In a presentation delivered at this year's Ideacity in Toronto, Kathleen Richardson, senior research fellow in the ethics of robotics at De Montfort University and director of the Campaign Against Sex Robots, stated that sex robots are interrupting the development of our own empathy, a very special human feature.  ""Empathy is about taking into account what another person is thinking and feeling, and responding appropriately to it,"" she said. ""Empathy is not about projecting onto, or appropriating someone to use as you want. You can do that with an object. But I don't want you to do that with a person.""  Richardson thinks that sex robots are ""part of a new kind of technological elaboration that rests on a very dehumanising practice, where people are treated as sex objects,"" and that it's not the right direction for humanity to be heading in.  ""Everyone thinks [sex robots are] very exciting to begin with, but when you're alone and you have to carry a 40Ib robot upstairs, or their programme breaks down and you have to call 'support' and go through automated options to speak to an 'advisor' to find out why your robot is twitching it's head repeatedly—the excitement will quickly fade,"" Richardson told Motherboard. ""You will realise there's only other people and we have to find a way to build healthy and loving relationships with each other.""  But looking further ahead, if in the future artificial intelligence technology becomes so advanced that even human-like sentience is reproduced, would it be ethically right for humans to use these objects for love? Again, for Ess, the answer is no.  ""In robot ethics, there's now a fairly well-established tradition of saying 'no',"" he replied. ""If we develop machines that have some version of autonomy, and especially the ethics of sense of respect for one another as persons—if we build machines that can come to approximate that, then it would seem we would have to develop rules for respecting that as well. They would have rights.""  Ess said that the water gets even murkier when we try to define when that consciousness happens—when an object becomes no longer just an object. It's worth considering: If we get to that point, will these robots even be robots any more?  Want more Motherboard in your life? Then sign up for our daily newsletter.

2019-12-19 00:00:00,2019,12.0,19,Facebook to ban census suppression on its platforms,"Washington (CNN Business)Facebook (FB) said Thursday it will soon ban misinformation about the 2020 census in a bid to ""promote an accurate count of every person in the country"" — its latest effort to combat criticism over its handling of political disinformation on the platform. The ban covers content by politicians as well as advertisers, and prohibits posts that mislead Americans about where, when and how to participate in the census.  Facebook's new policy will likely be put to the test in real time, as the US Census Bureau begins surveying its first households early next year. But how Facebook's enforcement could play out is an open question. Facebook has said it's eliminated billions of fake accounts this year and thousands of pieces of content that violate various company policies, in an indication of its progress. But watchdog reports suggest the company has continued to struggle with misleading political content despite new policies designed to limit its reach. The decennial Census is a politically crucial count of the US population that underpins congressional redistricting as well as the disbursement of federal funding for a wide array of programs.  Other content subject to the ban includes false claims that could spread fear or concern about the census. An example, Facebook said, would be posts that say participating in the census could lead to a law enforcement crackdown or that a participant's census information may be shared with other government agencies.  ""We will begin enforcement next month and use a combination of technology and people to proactively identify content that may violate this policy,"" wrote Kevin Martin, Facebook's vice president of US public policy, and Samidh Chakrabarti, a product director in the company's civic engagement division, in a blog post. They added that the new policies were developed with input from experts from the US Census Bureau, federal lawmakers and civil rights groups. Under an additional policy for advertisers, Facebook said, ads that ""portray census participation as useless or meaningless"" will also be banned. Advertisers who wish to run ads related to the census will be expected to undergo the same verification process that the company requires of political advertisers, Facebook said.  Some civil rights groups welcomed the announcement. In a statement, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights said Facebook had ""finally listened"" to concerns about potential census interference and had developed ""the most comprehensive policy to date"" to fight census misinformation on its platform. Then it vowed to hold Facebook to its commitments. ""Any good policy is meaningless without proper enforcement,"" the group said. ""We, along with our partners, will continue to work with Facebook to ensure that policies against census and voter interference are fully implemented. The census and our elections demand extreme vigilance — there are no do-overs."" In October, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez expressed confusion about Facebook's policies while questioning CEO Mark Zuckerberg.  Ocasio-Cortez asked whether Facebook's policies permitted her to advertise the wrong election date to voters in predominantly black districts.  Zuckerberg said that that conduct would be prohibited under the company's existing policies banning voter suppression on the platform, and pledged to extend the same approach to the census.  ""If anyone, including a politician, is saying things that can cause ... that is calling for violence, or could risk imminent physical harm, or voter or census suppression, when we roll out the census suppression policy, we will take that content down,"" he said.

2018-07-17 00:00:00,2018,7.0,17,EU decision on Google Android probably won't hurt mobile business,"On Wednesday, the European Union is expected to rule that Google illegally used the market dominance of its smartphone software, Android, to stifle competition, hitting the Alphabet-owned company with a hefty fine and aiming to change some of its business practices. Although the EU is reportedly considering a record fine -- higher than the $2.4 billion penalty it issued last year related to Google’s comparison shopping service -- the money isn’t the real problem for Alphabet. The maximum punishment the EU could issue is roughly $11 billion, or 10 percent of the company’s annual revenue, but the penalty is not expected to hit the high-end of that range. Plus, while $11 billion is a lot of money by any objective measurement, it's still only a fraction of the $102 billion in cash and short-term investments Alphabet had on hand last quarter. The real challenge for Google will come if the EU forces it to change its behavior. Google lets phone makers use the open-source Android software for free, but the EU has accused it of using restrictive licensing practices to benefit its own services, including forcing phone makers to bundle Google products like Search, Maps and Chrome with its app store, Play. The EU was also investigating agreements Google made with other companies to exclusively pre-install its search app and preventing them from selling other phones that run modified versions of Android. In theory, this decision could give other apps more room to compete with Google's. Phone makers could auction off specific app categories to other app makers, and they'd be more likely to pay a high price if they didn't have to compete with similar Google apps installed. Users might also be more likely to download third-party apps since they wouldn't have a pre-installed option. The ruling could also hamper the growth of Google's advertising business, where growth is being driven by mobile rather than desktop ads. If Google is forced to stop offering its apps as a suite, it would lose that automatic phone real estate, where it can sell more far ads than through third-party products. While some app makers have cheered this potential outcome, Gary Reback, the antitrust lawyer known for spearheading the efforts that led to the suit against Microsoft, is less hopeful that much will change. He says that issues highlighted in last years’ ruling on Google’s shopping service haven’t been fixed, in part because the decision was too little, too late, and that he doesn’t expect this decision to have meaningful effect either. “With any antitrust enforcement that goes to unilateral conduct, the remedy is not going to do much unless you fix the problem early,” he says. It's already been more than two years since the EU first issued its objections against Google and it will likely appeal any decision that comes on Wednesday, drawing the process out further. At this point, consumers in the EU may already be too entrenched in Google services to start using other apps even if Google's options are not preinstalled.

The biggest opportunity for could be in emerging markets like India, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa, where many people are new to mobile. (There isn’t the same potential for following the EU’s lead in China, another huge emerging market, since Google’s services are currently blocked there anyway.) Barry Lynn, director of the Open markets Institute and antitrust advocate, also has little hope that Google will end up making significant changes to its business in response to the EU’s decision, though he thinks it could possibly make the U.S. government take regulation more seriously. In the last year there has been an increased call for investigation of the tech monopolies, though there has been no action yet.

2017-01-25 00:00:00,2017,1.0,25,Google has banned 200 publishers since it passed a new policy against fake news,"Google kicked 200 publishers off one of its ad networks in the fourth quarter, partly in response to the proliferation of fake news sites. The company banned the publishers from its AdSense network, an ad placement service that automatically serves text and display ads on participating sites based on its audience. The ban was part of an update to an existing policy that prohibits sites that mislead users with their content. Google regularly weeds out advertisers for false or misleading claims, but impersonating news sites became an addition following the rapid rise of fake news, or propaganda sites. After the election, Google was blasted for placing a false story from a fake news site claiming Donald Trump had won the popular vote. (He had 2.8 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton.) Not all 200 publishers were swept up as part of the effort to root out fake news sites. Publishers were banned in November and December and included sites that impersonate real news organizations through shortened top-level domains, according to Google's 2016 ""bad ads"" report, normally released at the beginning of each year. So-called fake news publishers will sometimes take advantage of "".co"" domains by appearing similar to legitimate news sites that would normally end in "".com."" Google declined to provide a listing of the banned sites. Separately, the annual report on violations of advertising policy also included data on ads removed by Google. The company reported that in 2016 it took down 1.7 billion ads for violations, compared to 780 million in 2015. Google attributes the increase in ad removals to a combination of advertiser behavior andimprovements in technology to detect offending ads. Google added a policy mid-year to prohibit ads for payday loans, considered predatory. Roughly five million payday loan ads were disabled over the latter six months of 2016. Also among those the removed ads were what Google calls ""tabloid cloakers."" These advertisers run what look like links to news headlines, but when the user clicks, an ad for a product such as a weight loss supplement pops up. Google suspended 1,300 accounts engaged in tabloid cloaking in 2016. —By Tess Townsend, Recode.net.

2017-11-14 15:00:00,2017,11.0,14,I'm Attracted to My Therapist and It's Fine,"Okay, so here's the thing. There's this guy. And we met two years ago when I was in a supremely shitty place, after six months of aggressive struggling and spiraling. He was a great listener, didn't judge me for my fucked-up-ness, and most importantly, he had the drugs.  He’s my psychiatrist. He’s a sharply dressed, hella fine Latino man who doesn't flinch when I share details about dark days, my inability to show myself kindness, my self-isolation, or other shortcomings in the course of adulting. Unlike my ho-ass, rat bastard rheumatologist, he isn't prescription-happy and asks the tough but necessary questions. He doesn’t make me feel like a series of checkboxes or a lost cause, either. I admit that I was shocked upon entering his office that day—to re-up on my Zoloft—at his delightfulness, his charm, and his pretty mouth. Most of my therapists and psychiatrists have been white women, so I wasn't expecting to be flustered by a doctor. And, sure, opening up about my triumphs and tragedies to a pleasant, culturally competent, insightful man who doesn't look like a foot-faced goblin is not painful and does not suck at all. But that's where it ends. I don't shine up my shitshow before I see him for my quarterly drug tuneup. I don't candy coat the struggle or jazz up my craptastic barely-holding-on days when he asks how I've been doing. I’ve shown up, dumpy and rundown, overcome with wackness, ashiness, and hopelessness. I haven't lied to impress him with impressive tales of clear-headed functioning, unsabotaged excellence, or inflated self-worth when he's asked if I thought I was doing well. (I didn’t.) I'm not attributing my survival in the age of anus-mouthed presidential gargoyles to this magical and special bond we share. I'm a realist. We connect once every three months for about 30 minutes to determine if I’m more or less fucked up than before and if my prescription needs tweaking. It’s a welcomed opportunity to zoom out and take a macro view of my mental situation, as it’s harder to assess daily progress on my own while I’m here in the trenches. He gets the detailed, summarized version of the emotional combat I engage in with my psychologist each week.  I understand how potentially damaging or awkward it can be to develop feelings for your trusted mental or physical health professional. I get that being googly-eyed over a doctor can cloud judgment and make a person less honest about their struggles. I’ve heard stories from friends who’ve requested a change after being a little too excited about a sexy gynecologist diving in with forceps and speculums. This isn’t that. Being attracted to the person who’s helping you heal or find light in a world of darkness and shitbaggery is more normal than you’d probably expect, according to Quinn Gee, psychotherapist at Magnolia Mental Health in Washington, DC. “It is very common for clients or therapists to be attracted to each other. In transference and countertransference—feelings from a professional for their client—those emotions can manifest in a bunch of different ways,” she says. She points out that physical attraction isn’t the only concern; feelings like resentment, hostility, fear, and being overly comfortable with each other can affect the doctor-client relationship.  These feelings can develop, according to Gee, for many reasons: Do they remind you of an ex-lover? A teacher or relative you were afraid of? A childhood friend or classmate you were obsessed with? “As a client, it’s important to be mindful. If you know you are lying to your professional about your status, or downplaying your symptoms to appear more sane or like you’re struggling less to impress them, that’s a problem,” Gee says. “If you’re sleeping three hours a night for weeks or not eating well but hide these things to appear more together, that’s an issue too.”  I make sure Dr. Fine gets the unfiltered version of the shitshow. No bleeps, tidy endings, or glazed-over trainwrecks over here.  Transference—unconsciously redirecting desires and feelings, especially those harbored from childhood, onto a new person—is a concern for professionals, too. Gee (who was once cyberstalked by a patient with a personality disorder who wanted to be like her and went out of his way to learn about her) is upfront about both her negative and positive experiences: “We are attracted to our clients. We have favorite clients, and clients we dread or get anxiety about. It’s very normal. We’re all people.” She learned, however, the trouble of becoming too attached when she first moved to the Washington when she connected with a client who reminded her of hometown in Mississippi. “They became my favorite client. I found myself being not as straightforward about their issues. I liked them and didn’t want them to feel like things were wrong with them,” Gee says. “I consulted with a colleague about it, and we came up with some solutions. I kept it real with my client, apologized for the conflict, and laid out some options and steps we could take to help the situation.” If your psychiatrist does anything to encourage this infatuation, Gee cautions, that’s also not good. Thankfully, my guy has kept it classy, and hasn’t given me any signs of impending ho shit invitations or therapeutic drama.  Look. I can't help that the motherfucker has a great face, inviting demeanor, and a wonderful wardrobe. I have no plans to act upon this attraction, though. No “accidental” dick pics or covert flirtation. I’m grateful he’s helped me stay alive thus far, but I’m not proposing marriage, beating off to him at night, or building him a shrine. Yet.

2017-10-06 12:00:00,2017,10.0,6,Everything You Need to Know About Trichomoniasis,"Trichomoniasis (not to be confused with trichinosis, which is a roundworm parasite caused by eating undercooked meat—yummy) is an infection caused by the single-cell protozoan parasite  trichomonas vaginalis. It's not great, but probably won't do too much damage either—except maybe to your self-esteem. According to the National Institute of Health, ""trich"" is considered the most common curable STD, affecting 120 million worldwide, including 3.7 million in the US. The CDC estimates 2.3 million of those cases are women age 14-49—women are more likely to be infected and more likely to experience symptoms (sorry, ladies).  How will I know if I have it? You will either not know at all—or really, really know. Only about 30 percent of people who contract trichomoniasis develop symptoms, which usually occur around 5 to 28 days after its contracted. For women, the vulva, vagina, cervix, or urethra can be infected, which produces unpleasant-smelling, frothy discharge in a white, grey, or yellowish shade—as well as general itching and pain with urination or during sexual intercourse. In men, the infection usually occurs in the urethra. Although symptoms rarely occur, they can include irritation inside of the penis, discharge, and burning with urination or after ejaculation.   How is trichomoniasis treated? You gotta know when to fold 'em. If you have unusual discharge or pain during intercourse, it's time to close up shop for a bit and see your doctor. He or she will do a pelvic exam and test vaginal fluid for women, or urine for men. Trichomoniasis is easily treatable with a megadose of metronidazole, although all partners need to be treated to avoid re-infection. About 1 in 5 people treated get it again within three months. While undergoing treatment, you should avoid intercourse until the infection is cleared, which takes about a week. And don't drink for 24 hours after taking the antibiotic—unless you also want extreme nausea and vomiting.  What's the worst case scenario? Without treatment, trichomoniasis can last months or even years. If you are infected during pregnancy, you are at a higher risk of delivering prematurely—and could pass the infection on to the baby during birth. Because trichomoniasis may cause inflammation downtown, it also increases your risk of contracting other diseases. The infection is also associated with a two to three-fold increased risk of HIV contraction.  How do I protect myself? Trichomoniasis can be spread by vaginal, anal, and oral sex. The best way to protect yourself is with a latex condom—although, since the parasite can infect areas not covered by a condom, you may not be fully protected. Don't assume that your partner has been tested recently, either. Trichomoniasis is not one of the STIs that is routinely screened for—only pregnant women, high-risk patients, or those diagnosed with another STI are likely to have been tested. If you're concerned about trichomoniasis, ask your healthcare provider to test you. In the whole scheme of things, it's a pretty easy fix.

The Auxillite's simple aluminum design makes it look like something I'd be Okay with having on my phone The Auxillite is another crowdfunded adapter that hopes to make up for Apple’s 3.5mm omission by adding a Lightning port and headphone jack to the iPhone 7. It takes a different approach to most of the other solutions we’ve seen so far, by positioning the headphone and second Lightning port perpendicularly to the iPhone's charging port, allowing for a much slimmer profile on the bottom of the phone. And while there have been other dual-port iPhone 7 adapters, the Auxillite's simple aluminum design and small size makes it look like something I'd actually be okay with having on my phone (that I also wouldn't be afraid of suddenly snapping off).  There are two versions of the Auxillite: the standard model and the Auxillite S, that includes a foldable kickstand for propping up your phone. The Auxillite also serves as a DAC (playing back 16-bit audio with a 44.1kHz/48kHz sampling frequency and 24-bit audio with a 96kHz sampling frequency) and is also available in a Micro USB version. I assume any Android devices using the Auxillite would mostly be to benefit from the allegedly higher quality DAC, since I’m not currently aware of any major Micro USB phones that don't have a 3.5mm headphone jack. A USB-C version might have made more sense, given that there actually are USB-C phones without headphone jacks, but I guess that may have to wait for a later Auxillite model. Additionally, due to apparent ""safety issues / design limitation[s],"" the Micro USB Auxillite isn't able to simultaneously play music and charge a phone at the same time. The Auxillite costs $13 for the regular version and $17 for the Auxillite S, and is hoping to ship in January. As always with crowdfunded hardware, it’s important to be aware that the company has never shipped a product before. While Auxillite has applied for Apple’s MFi hardware certification, it has yet to receive approval. That said, if you're going to have to have an extra adapter for your iPhone to charge and listen to music simultaneously, the Auxillite could be the nicest-looking option available.",https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/10/26/13426884/auxillite-iphone-7-headphone-dongle-dac-kickstarter,Tech,The Verge,technology,410
2020-03-17 00:00:00,2020,3.0,17,"Soccer-Footballers could face mass layoffs over coronavirus, warns FIFPRO","March 17 (Reuters) - Football is facing its first economic crisis for decades with the prospect of mass layoffs of players if nothing is done to bail out clubs left without matches by the coronavirus pandemic, the global players’ union FIFPRO said on Tuesday. Professional football has been wiped off the map for weeks, maybe months, after all the major leagues, cups and international competitions were suspended, culminating in the postponement of Euro 2020 and Copa America on Tuesday. “There is no doubt that the health of everybody is the primary concern but the concerns of players are shifting very quickly towards their livelihoods,” FIFPRO general secretary Jonas Baer-Hoffmann told reporters in a conference call. “For the vast majority, a loss of income for two or three months is as threatening as for any other worker. “The consequences for our industry will potentially turn ugly very quickly, so any co-ordinated action is very, very important.” Baer-Hoffmann said that football had continued to grow during the 2008 financial crisis but the omens were not so favourable this time. “For the first time in decades, we are facing a real economic crisis in football,” he added. “There are simply not a lot of reserves that we can bank on. We know how club budgets are managed, they are always on the line of liquidity. “If we don’t respond very quickly to stabilise the cash flow we could see mass layoffs of players and staff members within weeks.” He added that while clubs in the big leagues should make it through the crisis, it was a different story in smaller markets. However, Baer-Hoffmann welcomed the decision to postpone Euro 2020 to give the chance for the current domestic seasons to be played out during the summer — if the health situation permitted them to re-start by then. He also welcomed a statement from FIFA president Gianni Infantino to propose a global assistance fund to help “members of the community” affected by the crisis. UEFA, meanwhile, has set up a working group to propose measures to mitigate the financial effects of the pandemic. “This is what we were hoping they would be doing,” he said. He added that players would need time to get into shape once football was able to re-start again. “The players will not be able to just walk out of their apartments and back on the pitch,” he said. “If they are in home quarantine for two months, they will need time to get back on their feet.” (Writing by Brian Homewood, editing by Pritha Sarkar)",https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-soccer-fifpro/soccer-footballers-could-face-mass-layoffs-over-coronavirus-warns-fifpro-idUSL8N2BA8V8,Healthcare,Reuters,health,426

2016-07-03 13:00:00,2016,7.0,3,Plants Can Assess Risk Similar to Animals,"Ask any gambler the secret to leaving a casino with the big bucks, and they'll tell you it's all about knowing when to walk away. Although they may not see it in these terms, the gambler's wisdom is actually exemplary of a highly evolved and desirable trait in humans and animals: the ability to assess risk. A gambler assesses poker chips and slot tokens rather than the more elementary resources (e.g., food and water) of the animal, but in both cases the success of the organism depends on its ability to accurately assess risk based on the availability of these resources. Risk assessment has previously been documented in dozens of animals, including humans, primates, birds, and insects. Recently, a team from Oxford and Israel's Tel-Hai College demonstrated for the first time that plants are also sensitive to the variability of resources in their environment, and are thus making risk assessments despite lacking a central nervous system. ""We do not yet know how the plants' sense variance functions, or even if their physiology is specifically adapted to respond to risk,"" said Alex Kacelnik, a professor of Zoology at Oxford. ""But the findings lead us to look even at pea plants as dynamic strategists and to model their decision processes just as one would model an intelligent agent."" In order to show that plants are also sensitive to risk, the researchers grew pea plants whose roots were split between two different pots. For each plant, one of the pots contained a consistent level of nutrients, while the nutrients in the other pot were considered variable. In this way, the researchers were presenting the plant with a choice between which pot to prioritize for its growth. These findings are consistent with risk sensitivity theory (RST), a leading theory on human and animal decision making which essentially amounts to the observation that animals are more likely to make riskier decisions in situations where taking a safer option wouldn't meet their needs. For the pea plant, it is safest to prioritize the pot with that has a consistent level of nutrients so long as that level of nutrients is enough for the plant to grow. If the nutrient level in the consistent pot is too low to support the plant's growth, it makes more sense to gamble by choosing the pot with the variable level of nutrients and hope for good luck. This is because in the worst case scenario, the plant is no better off than it would've been in the nutrient-deficient consistent pot; but in the best case scenario, the variable pot works in the plant's favor and provides a nutrient-rich environment in which the plant can thrive. Obviously plants aren't consciously making a decision between pots, but that's exactly what is so cool about the new research. It demonstrates that plants respond to the changes in their environmental resources much like animals do, even though they lack a nervous system to assess these changes and the risk they pose. By understanding the mechanism used by plants to assess risk, the researchers hope to gain a better understanding of the adaptive significance of resource sensitivity in non-human organisms. ""We do not conclude that plants are intelligent in the sense used for humans or other animals,"" said Kacelnik. ""But rather that complex and interesting behaviours can theoretically be predicted as biological adaptations—and executed by organisms—on the basis of processes evolved to exploit natural opportunities efficiently.""",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qkj39w/plants-can-assess-risk-similar-to-animals,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,571

2018-12-07 00:00:00,2018,12.0,7,Brain implants might one day help paralyzed patients use tablets,"(Reuters Health) - - Paralyzed people might one day be able to operate smartphones and tablets just by thinking about the actions they want to perform, with help from sensors implanted in their brains, a recent experiment suggests. While previous experiments have had some success using brain sensors paired with customized computers to help paralyzed patients type up to eight words a minute, the current test focused on making it possible for these patients to use tablets and smartphones right out of the box without any special modifications, said lead author Dr. Jaimie Henderson of the Stanford University School of Medicine in California. “We are still likely a number of years away from having a fully implantable, FDA-approved device that would be available for widespread use,” Henderson said by email. “However, I’m convinced that most of the technological hurdles have been solved and that we will one day in the near future see assistive devices that allow people with paralysis to control a computer using only their thoughts.” The current experiment included just three patients. Two of them had weakness or loss of movement of their arms and legs due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease; a third patient was paralyzed from a spinal cord injury. For the experiment, scientists implanted devices the size of a baby aspirin into the motor cortex, the area of the brain involved in planning and executing voluntary movements. The implant was designed to detect signals associated with intended movements and then transmit these signals to a Bluetooth interface configured to work like a wireless mouse. The virtual mouse was paired to an off-the-shelf Google Nexus 9 tablet. With the sensor and the wireless “mouse,” participants were able to navigate through commonly used tablet programs, including email, chat, music-streaming and video-sharing apps. They also messaged with family, friends, members of the research team and their fellow participants. And, they surfed the web, checked the weather and shopped online. One participant, a musician, played a snippet of Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” on a digital piano interface. Participants were able to make up to 22 point-and-click selections per minute while using a variety of apps, researchers report in PLoS ONE. In text apps, the participants were able to type up to 30 effective characters per minute using standard email and text interfaces. The research was done by the BrainGate consortium, a team of doctors, scientists and engineers who are working on products to restore independence to individuals with paralysis and neurologic diseases. BrainGate members and other research groups have previously shown that the device in the current study can enable people to move robotic arms or regain control of their own limbs, despite having lost motor control due to injury or illness, the study authors note. “For a little less than two decades, researchers have been developing brain-computer interface (BCI) systems to restore lost function (such as communication and movement) to persons living with chronic paralysis,” said A. Bolu Ajiboye of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. “These systems capture the natural activities of the brain, and allow users to command and operate usually specialized devices by direct modulation of brain activity (i.e. just by thinking),” Ajiboye said by email. Ajiboye has worked with BrainGate but wasn’t involved in the current experiment. The unique aspect of the current project is that it doesn’t require customized tablets and can work with the same products consumers without paralysis might buy, said Steven Chase, co-director of the program in neural computation at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. “What’s new here is the rather elegant demonstration that patients can control an unmodified computer tablet and interact with all the common software programs that these devices have: email, web browsers, chat programs, etc.,” Chase, who wasn’t involved in the experiment, said by email. “This means that specialized software won’t have to be designed for users of these devices, which greatly expands the range of applications these patients would immediately have access to.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2KK0zem PLoS ONE, online November 21, 2018.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-prosthetics-brain-implant/brain-implants-might-one-day-help-paralyzed-patients-use-tablets-idUSKBN1O62BA,Health News,Reuters,health,675
2016-09-25 00:00:00,2016,9.0,25,Cleveland area has at least seven fatal drug overdoses in one day," (CNN)Seven people died from drug overdoses in Ohio's Cuyahoga County on Saturday, prompting the county's medical examiner to issue a public health warning.  Fifty-two drug overdose deaths occurred in August alone, the highest such number in a given month for the county. said Chris Harris, the communications specialist for Cuyahoga County medical examiner's office. Three-hundred fifty people in the county have died from drug overdoses in 2016, and it is projected to have 500 fatalities caused by opioid drug overdoses by the end of the year, doubling the number from the previous year, according to Harris. ""This cluster of deaths is deeply concerning,"" medical examiner Thomas Gilson said in a statement. ""Although there is no clear link between the individuals, this number clearly raises the possibility of a very deadly drug in the community."" Cleveland is in Cuyahoga County, in the northeastern part of the state. The county and the state have experienced a record number of overdoses in the past few months caused by the same three opioids: heroin, fentanyl and carfentanil.  The drugs that caused the overdoses are still unknown and the incidents are under investigation, authorities said.  Powerful drugs Carfentanil and fentanyl are both strong opioids that drug dealers are now mixing with heroin in order to give the drug a boost and make their supply last longer, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.  Fentanyl is commonly used by cancer patients for pain relief, and it is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. Carfentanil is a sedative for large animals that's not approved for human use. A version of fentanyl, this drug is 10,000 times stronger than morphine. As little as 2 milligrams of carfentanil can knock out an African elephant weighing nearly 2,000 pounds. Law enforcement and health officials have seen the presence of carfentanil and fentanyl increase in recent months.  In August, 90 heroin overdoses that occurred within five days in western Cincinnati were linked to fentanyl. A few weeks later, Hamilton County Coroner Dr. Lakshmi Kode Sammarco announced that 8 deaths in the Cincinnati area were caused by the drug's powerful counterpart, carfentanil, as well. An opiate task force After California, Ohio had the second-largest number of opioid-related deaths in the country in 2014, according to the Center for Disease Control. A number of states across the country are facing a similar increase in fatal drug overdose deaths caused by opioids. Opioids were involved in 61% of all drug overdose deaths in 2014, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and fatal drug overdoses are growing at an alarming rate each year.  ""If you look at the cause of death, we just don't normally see increases like this,"" Robert Anderson, the chief of the mortality statistics branch at the National Center for Health Care Statistics at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention previously told CNN.  Ohio recently passed the Good Samaritan law, which allows people to report fatal overdoses without fear of legal consequences.  Cuyahoga County has created an opiate task force, and implemented Project D.A.W.N. in 2013, which educates people about opiate overdose signs and provides free naloxone kits to help prevent overdose fatalities.

2016-05-27 13:00:00,2016,5.0,27,Love in the Time of Ridesharing,"To say that technology has had a significant impact on dating in the last five years would be like saying ice cream is a tasty treat: achingly obvious and a massive understatement. But while it's easy to deduce the effects things like Tinder and long-distance, remote-controlled sex toys have had, there are other technological influences that may not be so apparent. What about the apps that weren't designed with dating in mind at all? What about Uber? Once you start to consider it, it becomes equally obvious that rideshare apps would change the way we date. Transportation has always been a major aspect of socializing, whether it was going a-courting in your horse-drawn carriage or making out at the drive in. But precisely what effects this new technology has on our love lives is less obvious. After lots of research and spending too much time watching a couple go at it in the backseat of a taxi, here are four ways ridesharing has changed modern dating: It's a way to meet potential dates With all the swipeable reams of possible love connections now available at our fingertips, it almost seems old fashioned to meet someone in the back of a cab, but lots of people are attempting to do just that. ""Most of the time, carpool rides are pretty awkward. People just sit there and keep to themselves,"" Harry Campbell, a rideshare driver who runs the popular Rideshare Guy blog about the driving community, told me. ""But later in the evening on a Friday or Saturday night, people tend to be more friendly and interactive. They're in that mood already, more friendly and jovial, so they're more likely to hit it off. I've seen lots of people exchange business cards and numbers and things like that."" Campbell mused that because dating apps and sites have started to overshadow the scene, there's something appealing about meeting someone ""organically,"" in the back of a cab—the ""lost art of meeting someone in person,"" he called it. And since the demographics of people who use apps like Uber are pretty narrow, the odds are high you'll meet someone who runs in similar circles as you do. But passengers don't stop at the backseat when it comes to using Uber as their own personal speed dating service: drivers often get hit on by passengers, Campbell said, especially female drivers. A quick trawl on Craigslist's missed connections shows both drivers and passengers who didn't have the nerve trying to track each other down: Though they sometimes hit it off and exchange numbers (Campbell said this is sort of ""frowned upon"" by the companies, though not explicitly grounds for getting kicked off the app), more often drivers are left having to awkwardly swat away advances without putting their rating at risk. On the flip side, there have been numerous reports of drivers aggressively hitting on, or even assaulting, their passengers. It's disrupted dating etiquette Etiquette around asking out your Uber driver aside, what should you do when you're already dating? Is ordering up a car for your date using your account at the end of the evening the modern equivalent of holding the door? Daniel Post Senning, an etiquette expert at the Emily Post Institute and the great-great grandson of Emily herself, told me it can definitely be a nice gesture, but you should offer first. ""It might be, on the one hand, incredibly gentlemanly or gentlelady-like to offer to send someone an Uber, but don't just assume someone is going to be comfortable giving you their home address,"" Post Senning said. ""Safety trumps etiquette."" Same goes for sharing an Uber—something your love interest might be iffy on after only a 20 minute coffee date. But if you've already been dating long enough to know his or her address, or you get the green light, go for it. It's made dating easier (especially in LA) If you live in a city like New York, where you can easily ride your bike or grab the subway or even hail a cab to meet up with your cutie, it might not seem like rideshare apps have made a drastic difference. But in LA, where the car is king, it's changed everything. ""Without any doubt, it makes it easier,"" Ty Foster, a 30-year-old musician living in Echo Park, told me. ""The change has been kind of subtle but profound."" Foster explained that taking a traditional cab was rarely an option—they're hard to come by and expensive in LA—and public transit is significantly lacking. So pre-Uber, most Angelenos had to keep a running itinerary of their day's plans, weighing whether or not they could have an extra beer or if they were up for walking to their girlfriend's house after an evening out. Now, Foster says rideshare apps have made it easier to meet people, and make spontaneous plans. ""I'm dating a girl in Silver Lake now and being able to meet up with her without having to plan ahead—so I can have a couple drinks, or go to a gig, and meet up with her later without having to think about it, that is an incredibly significant change,"" Foster said. It's created a new kink Rule 34 of the internet states that if something exists, there is porn about it. If you ask me, Rule 34 of sex should be: if something exists, somebody out there has a fetish for it. Aside from the weirdly-common fantasy about seducing an Uber driver and the fact that, yes, Uber-themed porn exists (NSFW link), there's also a sizable population of couples interested in getting busy in the back of rideshare cars. Some are polite enough to solicit advice on Reddit first, asking how to go about fulfilling this fantasy, while others just go for it and wind up getting caught on the dashboard camera (semi NSFW link). ""I know drivers that have had passengers say 'I'll give you $100 if you just drive around for 20 minutes and let us have sex in the back of the car,'"" Campbell, the Rideshare Guy, told me. ""I've never had that happen, personally, but I have had couples getting a little too frisky in the backseat. It's pretty awkward."" If it's something you're into, it's probably best to make sure you have a driver who's game first, lest you wind up on a dash cam—or kicked out of the car.

2016-10-05 00:00:00,2016,10.0,5,"Birth control linked to depression, new study says"," (CNN)Taking hormonal birth control might be associated with an increased risk for depression compared with those who don't use contraception, according to a new study published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry last week.  The finding is something that users have long suspected, as about 30% of women who ever used the pill in the United States eventually quit because of dissatisfaction with side effects, according to a 2013 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (PDF). ""We have known for decades that women's sex hormones estrogen and progesterone have an influence on many women's mood. Therefore, it is not very surprising that also external artificial hormones acting in the same way and on the same centers as the natural hormones might also influence women's mood or even be responsible for depression development,"" said Dr. Øjvind Lidegaard, a professor at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and lead supervisor of the study. Lidegaard and his colleagues tracked the health of more than 1 million Danish women between the ages of 15 and 34 over 14 years, using data from the National Prescription Register and the Psychiatric Central Research Register in Denmark. To ensure that depression was properly identified in connection with birth control use, women with a depression diagnosis before their 15th birthdays or the start of the data collection were excluded. After analyzing the data, the researchers found that the use of hormonal birth control was positively linked to a subsequent depression diagnosis and use of antidepressants. Depression risk, by the numbers Among all hormonal birth control users in the study, there was a 40% increased risk of depression after six months, compared to women who did not use hormonal birth control, the researchers found. The mean age of birth control users in the study was 24. The users of combined oral birth control pills experienced a 1.2-fold higher rate of subsequently taking antidepressants during the study period than those not using the birth control. Women who used progestin-only birth control pills experienced a 1.3-fold higher rate, according to the study.  As for non-oral forms of hormonal birth control, those who used the transdermal patch had a two-fold increased risk and those who used the vaginal ring had a 1.5-fold increased risk. Similar rate increases were found for depression diagnoses, according to the study. The researchers noted in their study that the difference in risk rates among women taking non-oral and oral forms of birth control might be due to a difference in dose rather than how the contraceptives are administered.  The researchers also noted that this association does not imply that birth control alone causes depression -- and more research is needed to better understand the possible link. ""Adolescents seemed more vulnerable to this risk than women 20 to 34 years old. Further studies are warranted to examine depression as a potential adverse effect of hormonal contraceptive use,"" the researchers wrote in their study. One of the study authors has a history of consulting for two pharmaceutical companies, Lundbeck and AstraZeneca, and another author reported receiving funds for talks from Exeltis. No other conflicts of interest were disclosed. Lidegaard said the study results could translate to women in the United States. In the United States, about 62% of women 15 to 44 years old use some form of contraception (PDF).  Among those women, 16% use the pill, 15.5% use female sterilization, and 7.2% use long-acting reversible contraception, such as an IUD or implant, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.  What this new data means for women What do other experts think of the new study? Dr. Kathryn Holloway, an ob-gyn practitioner at the Institute for Women's Health in San Antonio, Texas, called it impressive.  However, while there may be a correlation between hormonal birth control with the prescription of antidepressants and perhaps a depression diagnosis, causation is hard to prove, she said. ""Although this study suggests an increased risk of depression with combined hormonal contraception, the increase does not seem so great as to significantly change how I counsel patients,"" Holloway said, adding that, ""Depression is not something to be taken lightly and should not be a missed diagnosis. It is important for physicians to monitor and evaluate for any possible side effects, even if rare, with any prescribed medication."" While birth control comes with some negative side effects, from stomach cramps to increased risk of stroke, it can also provide some health benefits. Hormonal birth control not only prevents unwanted pregnancies, but also can regulate menstrual cycles, treat endometriosis pelvic pain, control symptoms of fibroids, help acne breakouts, and reduce the risk of some cancers that affect reproductive organs. There are some forms of birth control that are not hormonal, Holloway said. ""Hormonal contraception options range from the combined oral contraceptive pills to an intrauterine device and a birth control shot such as Depo-Provera,"" Holloway said.  ""Non-hormonal contraception options include condoms, cervical caps, the vaginal sponge and spermicide, and the copper IUD,"" she added. ""Some patients are successful with natural family planning by monitoring their cycle on a calendar or menstrual cycle app. It's up to the patient and their ob-gyn to decide which method of birth control is right for their lifestyle and well-being.""

2018-02-08 00:00:00,2018,2.0,8,Twitter stock soars after the company reports first-ever net profit,"Twitter shares jumped more than 20 percent Thursday after the social media company reported a net profit for the first time and returned to revenue growth. Here's what Twitter reported before the opening bell: The news rocketed Twitter's stock price by more than 23 in early trading Thursday. The company said during its earnings report in October that if it hit the high end of its estimates of $220 million to $240 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter, it could be profitable under generally accepted accounting principles. The company's adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was $308 million, ahead of the estimated $241 million analysts were predicting. GAAP net income was $91 million, while non-GAAP net income was $141 million. Though monthly active users grew only 4 percent year-over-year, daily active users went up 12 percent. (The company does not elaborate on exactly how many users use its platform each day.) Twitter said MAUs were lower due to a number of reasons including a crackdown on fake accounts and malicious activity, which made up less than 5 percent of its MAUs. It also said Q4 was traditionally a weak season for the company, and noted a change to Safari's third-party app integration impacting about 2 million MAUs. Twitter said total revenue increased 2 percent from a year earlier, and advertising revenue increased 7 percent year over year. It emphasized that 2018 will be an investment year, with the company putting money back into improving ""information quality"" by removing malicious content, spam, fake accounts as well as making it easier to identify credible accounts. It also will put money toward driving engagement and growing its sales team. Despite hitting profitability, Twitter will soon have to navigate its future business without Chief Operating Officer Anthony Noto. The executive announced in January he would be taking over as CEO of finance startup SoFi beginning March 1.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/08/twitter-q4-2017-earnings-revenue.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,319

""Those pictures, while they're not the real phone — they're based on designs and molds and engineering samples — I would say that's 99 percent the phone. It always looks better than it does in those crappy molds and dummies. But I think that's the phone,"" Jonathan Geller said on ""Squawk Box. "" On Tuesday, BGR published photos of the presumed iPhone 8 mock-up provided by a third-party case maker. BGR said the dummy phone confirmed several months of reports on details of what 's next phone would include such as glass on the front and back and stainless steel edges. While the dummy isn't meant to be an iPhone clone, BGR said, it still gives consumers an idea of what to expect from Apple's highly anticipated iPhone 8. CNBC reached out to Apple for comment. On Friday, Apple mistakenly made firmware for its upcoming HomePod speaker available to the public. The firmware included key details surrounding the upcoming iPhone 8, according to developer Steve Troughton-Smith, who dissected the firmware release. Shares of Apple were higher Wednesday, one day after the company reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped estimates. The stock was surging about 6 percent in premarket trading to record highs as the tech giant sold more iPhones than expected. Despite expectations for a ""lame duck "" quarter ahead of the iPhone 8 launch, Apple sold 41 million iPhones during the fiscal third quarter, surpassing 1.2 billion total iPhones sold. When asked whether a company could come along and threaten Apple, Geller said: ""There are always variables."" ""What's Apple's strategy has always been is to take a super long view and to let the pieces come together. We're seeing the fruits of their labor from three, four, five years ago, potentially even longer at this point in terms of what they're doing with the phone, the ecosystem, the hardware,"" he said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/02/apple-blogger-says-the-iphone-8-mockup-he-got-is-99-percent-the-phone.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,341
2019-01-03 20:38:00,2019,1.0,3,Bethenny Frankel's Severe Fish Allergy Causes Plane to Turn Around,"Weeks after suffering a near-fatal allergic reaction to fish, Bethenny Frankel came close to another potential deadly encounter. The Real Housewives of New York City star revealed that she was flying on Thursday when she boarded the aircraft and realized the crew was serving fish despite her calling ahead to check she would be safe. After bringing it to their attention, Frankel, 48, said the pilot “delightfully announced” to all of the passengers that they had to turn around — something the star said she tried to stop so not to inconvenience other passengers. “Called airline mult [iple] x [times] to say I have fish allergy. Got on & they’re serving bass,” she tweeted. “They couldn’t not serve it they said. Then they were turning around which I protested bc it would delay people. Cabin asked to not serve it & pilot made announcement to plane. That was fun. #epilife” Called airline mult x to say I have fish allergy. Got on & they’re serving bass. They couldn’t not serve it they said. Then they were turning around which I protested bc it would delay people. Cabin asked to not serve it & pilot made announcement to plane. That was fun. #epilife — Bethenny Frankel (@Bethenny) January 3, 2019  However, experts tell PEOPLE that the pilot made the correct decision in turning the plane around. Frankel then retweeted a recent story about a young boy from New York whose family claim he died after fish was cooked near him. How exactly the boy died currently remains under investigation. Immediately after her tweets, fans began to offer their opinions on the situation, with some suggesting Frankel fly on private planes to avoid potentially fatal encounters with fish. In response, Frankel explained, “I am fortunate enough to do that sometimes, but it is a massive waste and not environmentally friendly if doing so. But I hears ya.” When someone asked if she had the ability to invest in a personal plane, Frankel added, “I ain’t got it like that. And I want to work less not more.” I am fortunate enough to do that sometimes, but it is a massive waste and not environmentally friendly if doing solo. But I hears ya. https://t.co/myCb4ppvKx — Bethenny Frankel (@Bethenny) January 3, 2019  I ain’t got it like that. And I want to work less not more. https://t.co/fAgHtN70gC — Bethenny Frankel (@Bethenny) January 3, 2019  After some fans debated the severity of serving fish on an enclosed aircraft — “I didn’t know that could be an airborne allergy!” wrote someone — Frankel offered her own perspective and knowledge on the situation. “To clarify: some allergens are transmitted by touch & air. Fish is one & is fatal. The more exposure to them, the more susceptible,” she wrote. “It’s not like an immunity thing where more exposure means less susceptible. It’s opposite. I’ve always kept it quiet but that’s over now.” She also explained to her followers that “Being trapped in a cabin w no windows w cooking fish is a death trap,” and argued that “The airlines and world needs to change. I was always self conscious about it & today didn’t help.” It is currently unclear which airline Frankel was flying at the time of the incident, but the reality star said they “know who they are.” Reps for the reality star did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment. Frankel has been vocal about fish allergy awareness for quite some time. Recently, she was hospitalized after suffering from a nearly fatal allergic reaction. “I have a rare fish allergy. Sunday, I had soup, itched & was unconscious for 15 mins then to ER & ICU for 2 days w BP of 60/40,” Frankel tweeted in December. “I couldn’t talk, see, thought I had a stroke & dying & told if 5 mins later I’d be dead. 911 & EPI saved me. I’ll never not carry an #epipen.” Frankel also thanked Newton Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts by tagging them on Twitter and writing, “xo.” “She was in ICU for two days and just got out tonight,” a friend of Frankel later told PEOPLE. “She almost died. It was that serious. Her blood pressure was through the roof and she was unconscious. She went into anaphylactic shock. Her boyfriend saved her life.” Frankel also previously suffered an allergic reaction on RHONY when the girls visited Cartagena, Colombia during season 10. “Is there fish in that soup?” Frankel fearfully asked her co-stars during the episode while they were all seated for dinner. “I’m itching. My throat is itching. I thought it was chicken, f—.” She quickly fled the room with water in her hand only to come back later to admit she vomited. “It’s the worst feeling, your throat gets itchy, you feel like you’re going to throw up,” Frankel explained in a confessional. “It’s like poison inside you.”",https://people.com/health/bethenny-frankel-plane-turn-around-fish-allergy/,health,People,health,814
2020-02-06 00:00:00,2020,2.0,6,WHO investigates Singapore conference linked to foreign virus spread,"SINGAPORE, Feb 6 (Reuters) - At least three employees of a multinational company that held a meeting of more than 100 international staff in Singapore have contracted the new coronavirus, sparking a World Health Organization investigation of the case. Malaysia and South Korea have confirmed three cases of the virus related to the mid-January company meeting held with 94 overseas staff at the Grand Hyatt hotel, and Singapore said late on Wednesday four other attendees were showing symptoms. Authorities have not revealed the name of the company that held the meeting or said what business it is involved in. Malaysian health authorities have said people from China including one from the city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged in December, attended. “WHO is coordinating with relevant ministries of health in relation to it,” Olivia Lawe-Davies, a spokeswoman for the WHO, said in response to questions from Reuters. “As countries are stepping up surveillance, the detection of more cases of local transmission can be expected.” Singapore has reported 28 cases of the coronavirus, including some involving person-to-person transmission. The cases linked to the Singapore business meeting provide more evidence the virus is spreading through human-to-human contact outside China, which the WHO has said is deeply concerning and could signal a much larger outbreak. China reported its biggest daily jump in fatalities from the virus on Thursday, up 73 to 563, although there have been only two reported deaths outside mainland China. Malaysian health authorities first revealed the link to the Singapore business meeting when they confirmed the case of a 41-year-old Malaysian who had attended it, along with colleagues from China. South Korea subsequently confirmed two cases involving South Korean who attended the conference. The Koreans and the Malaysian shared a buffet meal during the conference, South Korean media reported. Of the 15 Singapore attendees, four have been referred to its National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore’s health ministry said. All the overseas attendees have left Singapore, the ministry added. A spokesman for the Grand Hyatt, Gerald Kheng, said the hotel had been deep cleaned after it was first informed of the incident by the health ministry on Tuesday and it was not aware of any other cases among guests or staff. The city-state says no evidence has emerged of widespread community spread but it announced new precautionary measures on Tuesday including halting group activities such as school assemblies. Several firms in Singapore have suspended business and media events, including a big travel fair, but the Singapore Airshow is set to go ahead next week albeit on a smaller scale.

           (Fox 10) An Arizona family is speaking out after claiming to find bed bugs in their daughter’s hospital room. Erin Ortega, whose daughter is being treated at Banner Desert Hospital in Mesa, said she and her wife allegedly spotted a bed bug on hospital-provided bedding on Monday night. She claims she alerted hospital staff, who allegedly moved the family to another room for staffing purposes, Fox 10 reported. “Sure enough, there was another bed bug on the floor behind the recliner, as well as a dead one that was stuck to the chair,” Ortega  told Fox 10. In a statement to the news station on Tuesday, the hospital said it immediately responds to any concerns raised by patients. “We are responsive to any concerns expressed by our patients,” the statement read. “We take immediate action to remedy isolated incidents as soon as we are notified.” WORLD CUP ATTENDEES URGED TO GET MEASLES VACCINE But Ortega, who said her daughter has been receiving exceptional care at the facility, said she’s concerned other patients are unaware of the situation. “We see family coming and going out of there still carrying bags, still carrying their sweaters, things like that, and it doesn’t seem that there’s much of a concern for their well-being,”  she told the news outlet. Bed bugs are not known to spread diseases, but they can cause itching and loss of sleep. A bed bug bite could also trigger an allergic reaction and require medical attention, according to the CDC. Ortega, who has other children at home, said she and her wife have not been able to stay with their daughter over concerns about the bed bugs and the risk of bringing them home.

2019-03-04 00:00:00,2019,3.0,4,Most polluted cities in the world: 22 of the top 30 are in India,"Hong Kong (CNN)India accounts for seven of the world's 10 cities with the worst air pollution, according to a new report, but previously smogbound Chinese cities have seen a marked improvement.  Gurugram, a suburb of the Indian capital New Delhi, is the world's most polluted city, according to Greenpeace and AirVisual, which found it had an average air quality index of 135.8 in 2018 -- almost three times the level which the US Environmental Protection Agency regards as healthy.  In two months of last year, the AQI in Gurugram -- as measured by levels of fine particulate matter known as PM 2.5 -- was above 200. The EPA regards this as ""very unhealthy"" and warns that ""everyone may experience more serious health effects"" if exposed.  According to the report, air pollution will cause around 7 million premature deaths globally next year and have a major economic impact.   ""Air pollution steals our livelihoods and our futures,"" said Yeb Sano, executive director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia. ""In addition to human lives lost, there's an estimated global cost of 225 billion dollars in lost labor, and trillions in medical costs. This has enormous impacts, on our health and on our wallets.""  The problem is particularly pronounced in South Asia. Eighteen of the world's top 20 most polluted cities are in India, Pakistan or Bangladesh, including the major population centers of Lahore, Delhi and Dhaka, which placed 10th, 11th and 17th respectively last year.  Climate change ""is making the effects of air pollution worse by changing atmospheric conditions and amplifying forest fires,"" the report said, while noting that the key driver of global warming, burning fossil fuels, is also a major cause of dirty air.  ""What is clear is that the common culprit across the globe is the burning of fossil fuels -- coal, oil and gas -- worsened by the cutting down of our forests,"" Sano said.  ""What we need to see is our leaders thinking seriously about our health and the climate by looking at a fair transition out of fossil fuels while telling us clearly the level of our air quality, so that steps can be taken to tackle this health and climate crisis.""  While South Asian countries, along with China, are the worst affected, air pollution is a global issue.  Of the 3,000 cities measured in the report, 64% exceeded the World Health Organization's annual exposure guidelines for PM2.5.  PM2.5 includes pollutants such as sulfate, nitrates and black carbon, which can sneak deep into the lungs and cardiovascular system. Exposure to such particles has been linked to lung and heart disorders, and can impair cognitive and immune functions.  Every single city included in the report in the Middle East and Africa exceeded WHO guidelines for PM2.5, as did 99% of cities in South Asia, 95% in Southeast Asia, and 89% in East Asia.  ""As many areas lack up-to-date public air quality information and are for this reason not represented in this report, the total number of cities exceeding the WHO PM2.5 threshold is expected to be far higher,"" the report warned.  One bright spot was China, once the world's poster child for urban air pollution. The report found that average concentrations of pollutants fell in Chinese cities by 12% from 2017 to 2018, while the capital Beijing has fallen out of the top 100 most polluted cities following concerted efforts to get air pollution under control.  China's most polluted city in 2018, according to the Greenpeace/AirVisual report, was Hotan in the far west. Baoding, which once ranked among the worst in the country, is now at number 33. When CNN visited in 2015, residents said they often couldn't see neighboring buildings because the air was so smoggy.  While China saw improvement, however, many neighboring countries suffered major increases in pollution, including in Indonesia, South Korea, Vietnam and Thailand.  In January, authorities in Bangkok deployed planes with special rainmaking capabilities -- a technique known as cloud seeding -- to relieve persistent pollution in the Thai capital. In the same month, cities across South Korea, China and India reported major spikes in air pollution, as winter fuel burning contributed to the smog blanketing the region.

2020-02-11 00:00:00,2020,2.0,11,Ocado steps-up spending as it counts cost of warehouse fire,"LONDON (Reuters) - British online supermarket and technology group Ocado reported a ballooning annual pretax loss, mainly due to a fire which destroyed a hi-tech flagship warehouse, and forecast a more than doubling of capital expenditure in its new financial year. Ocado on Tuesday said it expected to spend around 600 million pounds ($774 million) in 2019-20 as it prepares to open robotic warehouses for overseas partners. The first half of the year will see the opening of the first such state-of-the-art facilities, for Sobeys in Toronto, Canada and Casino in Paris, France. They are the first of more than 30 sites that will be operational over the next few years. Ocado has transformed itself over the last two years from a domestic grocery delivery firm to a provider of online retail technology, also winning partnerships with Kroger in the United States, Coles in Australia, and most recently Aeon in Japan. The deals have helped to push its shares 34% higher in the last year, giving it an 8.6 billion pound stock market valuation that dwarfs the equity values of traditional British supermarket groups such as Sainsbury’s and Morrisons at 4.4 billion pounds and 4.3 billion pounds respectively. Ocado’s shares were up 3.6% at 1054 GMT, even though it said its loss before tax widened to 214.5 million pounds ($276.8 million) in the year to Dec. 1, 2019 versus 44.4 million pounds in 2017-18. The loss reflected exceptional charges of 94.1 million pounds, mainly relating to the write-down of the Andover site in southern England that was destroyed by a fire in February last year and is now being re-built. While Ocado is fully insured, there is a time lag before it receives the full payout due. Some analysts have questioned Ocado’s valuation, saying that execution risks are proliferating and opportunities for it to win sizeable contracts in new geographies are becoming more limited. “Our estimates suggest shareholders currently expect the Ocado Smart Platform (OSP) to build to a total picking capacity size of circa 50 billion pounds in the next 10 years. Which feels far too optimistic to us,” said analysts at Jefferies. Ocado posted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 43.3 million pounds ($55.9 million), versus a re-stated 59.5 million pounds for 2017-18. That outcome, which also reflected accounting changes and the costs of share schemes, was broadly in line with analysts’ consensus forecast. The wider losses and drop in core earnings were despite a 9% increase in group revenue to 1.76 billion pounds, including 10.3% growth in retail revenue. “We are pleased to report results which show strong momentum in the business,” said Chief Executive Tim Steiner. “Although statutory results reflected a combination of factors, including the impact of the Andover fire, the underlying performance of Ocado Retail and the successful growth of Ocado Solutions were very encouraging.” The Ocado Retail division is now a joint venture between Ocado Group and Marks & Spencer. Their deal, completed in August, signalled the end of Ocado’s supply contract with upmarket supermarket chain Waitrose in September 2020 and the start of M&S’ first grocery home delivery service. Ocado said preparations for the switchover were progressing well. For the 2019-2020 year Ocado forecast retail revenue growth of 10-15% and invoiced international technology fees growth of at least 40%. It forecast EBITDA from retail above its revenue growth. However, EBITDA from UK solutions & logistics and from international solutions was forecast to decline. Prior to Tuesday’s update analysts’ average forecast for 2019-20 EBITDA was 33 million pounds.

2019-09-23 00:00:00,2019,9.0,23,Nimble tech firms must adapt as promised self-driving revolution hits speed bumps,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - When Silicon Valley startup Phantom Auto was formed in 2017, it was one of many software suppliers hitching their fortunes to self-driving cars, confident that fleets of robotaxis would be using their technology within a few years. But with delays in the mass deployment of autonomous vehicles, Phantom is now finding new customers off the road - on the sidewalk with delivery robots. Phantom is not alone. Faced with the harsh reality that an autonomous future is further away than originally promised by global automakers and tech companies like General Motors Co (GM.N), Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) and many others, smaller companies in the self-driving ecosystem are now pivoting to alternate uses for their technology. Some are turning to delivery robots, while others are helping deploy autonomous vehicles for farms, construction sites or airports. Robotaxis are still considered the industry’s “humongous opportunity,” in the words of Phantom co-founder Elliot Katz, but shifting to creative new ways to deploy the auxiliary technologies allows for immediate revenue during the long slog before autonomous vehicles hit the roads en masse. The widescale deployment of robotaxis, once pegged by industry analysts to be a $2 trillion industry by 2030, is now seen as further away due to a variety of hurdles, among them cost, complexity and unresolved legal and regulatory concerns. Meanwhile, more modest rollouts of self-driving vehicles are coming sooner in limited areas with defined borders. The shift in expectations is driving players large and small to rethink strategies and re-evaluate financial risk. On Monday, automotive technology supplier Aptiv PLC (APTV.N) said it has agreed to puts its self-driving vehicle unit in to a joint venture with South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co(005380.KS). Hyundai will contribute $2 billion to the venture. Rival automakers Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) in July agreed to combine autonomous vehicle operations. In Phantom’s case, its remote operations technology, which allows a human operator miles away from an autonomous car to take over control when the car is confused, can be used for less safety-critical tasks. Postmates, a San Francisco-based goods delivery company, will use Phantom’s technology inside fleets of over a hundred sidewalk robots as they navigate sidewalks and crosswalks to deliver lunches, snacks, or other goods to customers, beginning next year. “We had to figure out where is autonomous technology deployable today,” Katz told Reuters. “It’s about handpicking the right opportunity for the immediate term, medium term and long term.” Egil Juliussen, research director for automotive technology at IHS Markit, said that using the same technology for non-automotive applications, like robots, is a simpler path to market that can still tap the startups’ artificial intelligence technology. French autonomous shuttle maker and operator Navya SA (NAVYA.PA) threw out its financial targets in July and unveiled a new strategy of selling its technology to others. The catalyst was the continued uncertainty over regulation that jeopardized anticipated fleet orders by customers last year, Chief Operating Officer Jerome Rigaud told Reuters. That led to missed 2018 revenue projections and the removal of Navya’s founder and CEO. Navya still plans to test its self-driving shuttles without a safety driver by early next year, but it now sees new opportunities in areas where regulation is simpler: hauling goods at airports, industrial sites and construction areas at slow speeds in limited areas, and in agriculture, Rigaud said. Evangelos Simoudis, managing director of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Synapse Partners, which invests in autonomous technology startups, said VCs recognize that full self-driving will take much more money, as well as time, to recoup the 10x return on their investments of $5 million to $50 million - amounts that are typical in the sector. In the interim, smaller companies are on the line. “If they have flexibility they may pivot and go to something adjacent or radical in order to survive, but nonetheless there will be a period of significant change,” Simoudis said. “There will be quite a high mortality rate.” The sweet spot for companies searching for alternative ways to use self-driving technology is software related to simulation, data annotation and data management, Simoudis said. Companies making software are better positioned to pivot than those doing hardware, experts agree. There has already been some consolidation in the crowded field of lidar, a key hardware component using laser light pulses to help vehicles “see,” after some companies have struggled to raise new funds. Digital mapping is another area ripe for consolidation, Simoudis said. Automakers and others have snatched up these startups in recent years, including Strobe Lidar and Princeton Lightwave, which were acquired in 2017 by General Motors and Argo AI, respectively. Argo AI is majority-owned by Ford and VW. Earlier this year, self-driving startup Aurora bought Blackmore Lidar. Last month, food delivery company DoorDash bought startup Scotty Labs, a competitor to Phantom also involved in the remote control of autonomous vehicles. The loss of Scotty’s main customer, Voyage - which operates small fleets of self-driving vehicles in closed residential communities - and difficulties in raising funds led to its sale, two sources told Reuters. Executives at Ouster, a startup whose lidar technology is also found inside Postmates’ robots, said it was a conscious decision from the start to avoid focusing exclusively on automotive lidar. Instead of diversifying, too many companies have focused on the “pot of gold at the end of the rainbow,” said Raffi Mardirosian, Ouster’s vice president of corporate development, making them vulnerable to setbacks in the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles. “If you’re in these investor meetings like I am, they’re saying ‘Show me the contracts. Show me the monthly revenue,’” said Mardirosian. “The fact that we can point to that is something that will help us stay in business.” Reporting by Alexandria Sage in San Francisco; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Chizu Nomiyama",https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-autonomous-phantom/update-2-focus-nimble-tech-firms-must-adapt-as-promised-self-driving-revolution-hits-speed-bumps-idUSL2N26E0D1,Technology News,Reuters,technology,969

2019-04-08 00:00:00,2019,4.0,8,Key EU lawmaking committee votes against EU wifi-based car standard,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A key committee of EU lawmakers on Monday rejected a European Commission push for a wifi-based technology for cars, backing critics who support the alternative 5G standard. The EU executive is seeking to set benchmarks for internet connected cars, a market for carmakers, telecoms operators and equipment makers expected to be worth billions of euros a year. The Commission’s preference for the wifi-based ITS-G5 would give Volkswagen and Renault an edge over Daimler, Ford and PSA Group which endorse the rival 5G standard C-V2X. A clause requiring new technologies to be modified in order to be compatible with older technology has triggered alarm in the telecoms industry which is rooting for the 5G standard, and other involved parties. The European Parliament’s transport committee said the clause would put a brake on innovation. Commission digital chief Andrus Ansip, Finland and Spain have also voiced criticism of this requirement. The EU executive declined to comment on the parliamentary committee vote. Parliament will vote on the Commission’s proposal on April 17, which can only be blocked by a majority. The European Council also has a say in the issue and would also need a majority of EU countries to derail the proposal. Lobbying group and C-V2X supporter 5GAA has said the wifi push goes against the Commission’s campaign to promote 5G-based activities and boost economic growth.

2018-01-24 10:26:50,2018,1.0,24,Meet the $800 Smartphone That You Probably Won’t Buy,"Tech Fix There’s a smartphone that the United States does not want you to buy. It’s called the Mate 10 Pro, and it’s made by Huawei, a Chinese manufacturer that the American government has long suspected of committing espionage for China. The device, priced at $800, was supposed to make a big splash this year as the first high-end smartphone from Huawei in the United States. But AT&T, which intended to promote the Mate 10 Pro as a rival to premium devices from Apple and Samsung, abruptly pulled out of the deal this month, appearing to bend to pressure from Washington over security concerns. Verizon Wireless, the country’s biggest carrier, may have also canceled a similar deal because of political pressure, according to some reports. (Verizon declined to comment.) The snub by AT&T, the country’s No. 2 carrier, aroused a candid diatribe from Richard Yu, Huawei’s chief executive, this month at CES, the giant tech convention in Las Vegas. “It’s a big loss for us, and also for carriers,” he said. “But the more big loss is for consumers, because consumers don’t have the best choice.” Security issues aside, Mr. Yu may have a point. Based on a week of testing, the Mate 10 Pro is a solid all-around Android smartphone. It has an excellent camera that takes advantage of artificial intelligence to shoot clear, rich photos of pets, plants, food and, of course, people. The device has longer battery life than phones from Apple and Samsung, and, with durability in mind, it comes with a protective case and a screen protector. Yet without the backing of a big American carrier, the risks of buying the smartphone are high. While the Mate 10 Pro will still be available online next month and on sale at Best Buy stores by the end of the quarter, the lack of carrier buy-in means it will be tougher to get device support if your screen shatters or if something goes wrong. Here’s what you need to know about the device. The signature feature of the Mate 10 Pro is the processor, which has a dedicated part of its silicon specifically designed for artificial intelligence. This allows the phone to crunch algorithms and do things like automatically recognize an object so that the camera can be adjusted to focus quickly and let in the right amount of light. Huawei also says A.I. allows the phone to maximize its performance: Periodically, it will automatically do maintenance, like clearing out old system files that might otherwise slow down the phone. The camera is notable as well. Huawei teamed up with Leica, a popular camera maker, to develop the phone’s dual-lens setup. Like phones from Apple and Samsung, the Mate 10 Pro’s camera can create a so-called bokeh effect, where the two cameras work together to show the picture’s main subject in sharp focus while gently blurring the background. Like other modern smartphones, the Mate 10 Pro is water and dust resistant. But it also has an extra-large battery that Huawei says will last longer than that in many other phones. That’s partly because of its A.I. processor, which examines how the battery is being used and changes resource allocation to prolong its life. The Mate 10 Pro also ships with a screen protector applied to its display, and inside the box there is a plastic protective case. These are thoughtful additions. The case absorbs the impact of drops, and the screen protector helps prevent scratches, which weaken the structural integrity of a display. In my tests, the two best features of the Mate 10 Pro were the camera and battery. The least impressive was the display. But let’s start with the good stuff. In side-by-side comparisons with an iPhone X and Samsung’s Galaxy S8+, the Mate 10 Pro came in second to Apple’s offering in photo quality. All took nice photos, but the colors in the Galaxy S8+’s pictures looked oversaturated, and while the Mate 10 Pro’s photos appeared rich and clear, the shadow details looked better on the iPhone X. As for the bokeh effect, also known as portrait mode, the Mate 10 Pro excelled at separating the subject from the background compared with the Galaxy S8+, but I still preferred the iPhone X because it did a better job at lighting up a person’s face. There was one area where the Mate 10 Pro was the clear winner: the battery. In my tests browsing the web over a cellular connection, Huawei’s phone had roughly two hours more juice than Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8 and the iPhone X. The display — the biggest downside of the Mate 10 Pro — had a lower resolution than the Note 8, the Galaxy S8+ and the iPhone X, meaning some graphics and text looked more pixelated. Over all, text appeared crisper and websites more vibrant on the iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy screens than they did on the Mate 10 Pro’s display. The Mate 10 Pro is an impressive smartphone, but you probably aren’t going to buy it even if you get your hands on it. The lower-resolution display is a major negative, as is the lack of carrier support. Huawei said that to get technical support for the Mate 10 Pro, you can call its hotline, and for repairs, you can ship your device to a center in Texas. That’s still not ideal compared with the ease of strolling into an Apple store or your carrier’s nearest location. Privacy and trust are also important. In 2012, the House Intelligence Committee concluded that Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese telecommunications company, were a national security threat because of their attempts to extract sensitive data from American companies. And in 2016, security researchers discovered preinstalled software on some Huawei and ZTE phones that included a back door that sent all of a device’s text messages to China every 72 hours. That feature was not intended for American phones, according to the company that made the software. But American lawmakers have been wary of Huawei. Most important, you will have to decide whether you trust Huawei. The onus is on you to carefully read Huawei’s privacy policy and determine if you feel confident using this phone. In a statement, Huawei said that privacy and security were top priorities and that it complied with stringent privacy frameworks and regulations. At CES, Huawei’s Mr. Yu described how the company had previously overcome trust hurdles — including at home in China, where Huawei’s smartphones were initially distrusted by Chinese carriers because the company was a newcomer. “It was very hard,” he said. “But we won the trust of the Chinese carriers, we won the trust of the developing market and we also won the global carriers, all the European and Japanese carriers. Over the last 30 years, we’ve proven our quality.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/technology/personaltech/huawei-mate-10-pro-smartphone-review.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,1136
2016-08-27 00:00:00,2016,8.0,27,Coding boot camps replace college for software engineers,"Tucked away on the top of two floors of a downtown building in San Francisco, 160 students are sitting in front of computer screens, developing sophisticated web applications. Their school, Hack Reactor, is one of dozens of coding boot camps across the nation, turning students into software engineers. For many prospective students looking for a quick route to a six-figure salary at a big tech firm, coding camps have become attractive alternatives to colleges and grad schools. Muhsin Abdul-Musawwir chose Hack Reactor over finishing his computer science degree at California State University, East Bay. ""The Hack Reactor program was going to get me the skills that would translate directly into getting a job,"" said Musawwir. ""The computer-science route, while it may be something I may still explore later on, wasn't necessarily what I felt was going to ... get me the job, get me working, get me the skills I need to work and also build up my own practice."" Hack Reactor costs nearly $20,000 for a 12-week session, about one-tenth of the cost of attending an elite college. The program boasts a 98 percent job placement rate among its graduates, who land jobs at prestigious tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft. The average starting salary for graduates is $105,000 a year. Hack Reactor co-founder Shawn Drost says coding boot camps help address the shortage of software engineers, especially in tech-saturated areas like Silicon Valley. The company also has schools in Los Angeles, New York and Austin. Drost says unlike colleges, coding camps can quickly change curriculum to address the changing needs of the marketplace. ""Professional programs do change every six months or so, and we adopt that pretty much immediately,"" said Drost. ""So we are teaching up-to-date versions of recent open-source framework, and we are familiar with industry trends in a way that you don't generally see in college programs."" Students spend 12 to 16 hours a day in classes, listening to lectures, coding and collaborating in teams that simulate ones in tech firms. They also receive ""empathy training,"" which instructors say is a vital part of the program because the soft skills help them work well with others, which is important in the workplace. While critics argue a coding camp can't replicate a four-year education that colleges provide, Drost says by immersing students in a coding environment, they learn more quickly. ""I think people underestimate how much you can learn in a short time frame,"" said Drost. ""You can really compare and contrast the difference between different modes of learning. If you've ever taken a language class in high school and college versus actually going to that country and immersing yourself, it's incredible."" Still, some raise concerns. Google recently conducted a study on coding camps. ""We found that boot camps show increasing promise in preparing their participants for full-time software development and engineering roles, and we've hired a handful of these students. However, our experience has found that most graduates from these programs are not quite prepared for software engineering roles at Google without additional training or previous programming roles in the industry, "" said the company's director of education and university relations, Maggie Johnson, in a statement. The White House is also paying attention to coding boot camps. Some students are now allowed to apply for federal grants and loans to help pay for certain coding schools, like the Flatiron School in New York, or MakerSquare in Austin, TX. President Obama has called coding boot camps ""a ticket to the middle class."" Musawwir agrees. The former coordinator of after-school programs is now a software engineer at Esurance. Since going through coding camp, Musawwir has doubled his salary.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/26/coding-boot-camps-replace-college-for-software-engineers.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,613
2017-04-20 00:00:00,2017,4.0,20,Oracle will pay more than $850 million for Moat,"Oracle will pay more than $850 million to acquire Moat, a company that tracks digital ads, according to a person familiar with the deal. Oracle announced its planned acquisition earlier in the week, but didn't disclose a price. The company declined to comment. Moat has had several incarnations, but most recently it has focused on its role as an auditor for digital ad buyers, where it tries to see if the ads marketers have paid for are appearing where they're supposed to appear. Both Facebook and Google allow Moat to check in, to varying degrees, on ads that run on those companies' platforms. Google's YouTube recently announced that it would work with Moat to help advertisers verify that their messages aren't running next to offensive videos. The deal hasn't closed yet. When it does, Oracle says Moat will operate as an independent unit, but will be offered as part of the company's ""data cloud"" suite of products. Moat's price tag is significant for a couple reasons: For starters, it shows there's still an appetite for some big ad tech properties, despite investors' generally gloomy consensus about the industry. It also shows that there are deep-pocketed buyers for ad tech outside of China, where investors paid big sums for ad tech last year. Bear in mind that the two biggest players in ad tech — Google and Facebook — were unlikely to have bid on Moat, since the company's value as a measurement company is based on the idea that it's independent. The Moat purchase is also a big deal for the New York tech scene, which has only had a handful of deals this size. Moat has raised a reported $67.5 million since 2010. —By Peter Kafka, Re/code.net.

2018-02-12 16:23:00,2018,2.0,12,Cryptocurrency Mining Hack That Compromised Thousands of Sites ‘Could Have Been a Catastrophe’,"Over the weekend, hackers injected thousands of websites—including UK and US government sites—with code that hijacked visitors’ computers to mine cryptocurrency.  The attack, noticed on Sunday by security researcher Scott Helme, was pulled off by compromising a single plugin that was used by all of the affected sites: Browsealoud, a reputable suite of accessibility and translation tools. According to Helme, the plugin was edited by attackers to embed a script that uses a site visitor’s computer to do the complex math that generates new digital coins (in this case, Monero). This process, known as “mining,” can slow down the victim’s computer.  The attack loaded malicious Javascript onto visitors’ computers. The hackers behind the attack chose to mine cryptocurrency, but they had the power to do almost whatever they wanted. ""It could have been a catastrophe, it really could have—that's not just scaremongering,"" Helme told Motherboard in a phone call. ""We were exceptionally lucky this was so mild and so quickly found."" They could have used their access to install a keylogger onto the victim’s computers, for example, or infected them with more invasive malware. “The only limitation of what happened here was the attacker's imagination,” Helme added.  Read More: Hackers Hijacked an Internet Provider to Mine Cryptocurrency with Laptops In Starbucks The cryptocurrency mining script was injected into as many as 4,275 websites, if we assume every site using Browsealoud was compromised (PublicWWW, a site that searches the source code of sites on the web, has a list). The UK’s information commissioner (ICO), UScourts.gov, numerous sites associated with the UK’s National Health Services, and many more. “The ICO’s website is up and running again following a problem with the Browsealoud feature on Sunday,” a spokesperson for the UK Information Commissioner’s Office told Motherboard in an email. “The website was taken down as a precautionary measure whilst we investigated the incident, which did not involve the access or loss of any personal data. The Browsealoud service has been temporarily removed from the website whilst further work is undertaken.” The UK National Cyber Security Center, a wing of the GCHQ, released a statement on Sunday saying that it is investigating the matter.  Surreptitious cryptocurrency mining is an increasingly popular method for shady sites or criminals to raise money. Last year, hackers compromised an Argentine internet service provider to embed a mining script on the login page for Starbucks Wi-Fi. The hijacking of thousands of sites at once—and government sites, at that—is a serious escalation in the scope and scale of this kind of cryptocurrency mining. The hackers used the popular browser mining service Coinhive, which can be used legitimately but has also become a favourite among criminals as well. While Coinhive initially stated that the hackers had merely copied its code, on Tuesday Coinhive admitted that their service was used in the hack. ""Sorry for the misinformation,"" spokespeople added in an email to Motherboard. In addition, Coinhive told Motherboard reporter Joseph Cox in a follow-up interview, the hackers made a grand total of $24 worth of Monero.  “Texthelp has in place continuous automated security tests for Browsealoud—these tests detected the modified file and as a result the product was taken offline,"" Martin McKay, CTO of Texthelp (the makers of Browsealoud), said in a company blog post. ""This removed Browsealoud from all our customer sites immediately, addressing the security risk without our customers having to take any action.” Over the phone, Helme said website administrators should be careful about the third-party content they load on their pages. There are already tools to control what content plugins can load on sites, such as Content Security Policy and Subresource Integrity. ""With those combined you have a very robust defense against exactly what this is attacking,"" Helme said. Last year, security researchers at Symantec foretold a looming “arms race” between malicious hackers mining cryptocurrency and the people trying to stop them; today, it seems like that race has really begun.

UPDATE:  The original version of this article stated that the cryptocurrency mining script came from Coinhive, but Coinhive spokespeople stated that the script was merely ""copied"" from their code, and the hackers used their own servers to communicate with the Monero network.

2019-07-25 00:00:00,2019,7.0,25,Watch SpaceX's scrapped Starship test,"New York (CNN Business)Elon Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, is ramping up early testing of technology that could one day carry people deep into the solar system.  The latest test flight of a prototype spacecraft, nicknamed ""Starhopper,"" was called off Wednesday before it left the ground, as plumes of smoke engulfed a development site in South Texas and bursts of flames surrounded the vehicle. It was slated to fly its highest ""hop"" test yet, to about 65 feet off the ground, and SpaceX set up a webcast for the event. But the attempt was aborted just moments after the rocket's massive engine fired up. The vehicle appeared to be undamaged, and the SpaceX team considered moving forward with a second attempt. But ultimately that was called off as well. Musk explained in a tweet that the ""chamber pressure"" in the rocket was ""high due to colder than expected propellant."" When contacted by CNN Business Thursday, SpaceX spokesperson James Gleeson said he could not immediately provide additional details about the test. Starhopper is designed to be an early precursor to a deep-space exploration rocket called Starship. The prototype craft is meant to conduct short ""hop"" flights as part of the Starship development program. The tests are ""designed to test the boundaries of the vehicle,"" said Kate Tice, a SpaceX engineer, on a livestream of the test Wednesday. In other words, no one was expecting the flight to go flawlessly. Starhopper has so far conducted two trial flights that brought the vehicle a tiny distance into the air while remaining tethered to the ground. Wednesday's test was set to be the first untethered flight attempt. It's not clear when SpaceX will attempt to fire up Starhopper for another trial run. Gleeson declined to comment.  SpaceX has high hopes for Starship. The latest designs for the towering spacecraft show it riding into orbit atop the most powerful rocket booster ever built, and Musk hopes the spacecraft and rocket system will be used to colonize Mars.

2017-03-01 00:00:00,2017,3.0,1,Parents adopt baby with no arms or legs," (CNN)The lives of a small but growing family in Utah have forever been changed thanks to a tiny, bright-eyed toddler from the Philippines named Maria. It's been over a year since Maria, now 3, who was born without her arms and legs, was adopted from a special-needs orphanage in Cavite, Philippines. Hoping to inspire other families to consider adoption, her parents, Adrianne and Jason Stewart, shared their daughter's story to mark her first adoption anniversary in a video posted on YouTube. Love What Matters, a blog dedicated to sharing inspiring stories, reposted the video and story, which has gotten over 700,000 views and more than 6,000 shares.  A story of courage In 2014, the family of five -- including the Stewarts' two biological daughters and an adopted son from the Philippines -- decided it was time to expand yet again. After contacting their adoption agency, Hand in Hand, they received a special home findings list: the names of children with special needs, older children and/or sibling groups waiting to be adopted in the Philippines. At the time, they hadn't discussed adopting a child with special needs, but they instantly fell in love when they saw a photo of Maria, who was only 9 months old. When she was 6 months old, Maria had been placed at the Chosen Children Village, an orphanage for children with special needs. Beyond a medical record that stated she was born without limbs, little was known about her, but her beautiful smile was all the Stewart family needed. ""When we found our daughter, we did not think that we were qualified or prepared enough to parent a child like her, a child born without arms and legs, but we knew that we could love her and that loving her was what mattered most,"" Adrianne Stewart wrote in the post. A story of hope After completing a seemingly endless amount of paperwork and enduring months of waiting, they received approval the next year to adopt their little girl. With many unknowns and only one photo of Maria, they traveled to the Philippines, both nervous and eager to meet their newest family member. Most picture their first meeting with their child as a perfect love story, but for Adrianne Stewart, it was a moment of clarity. ""I had hoped that she would be further along than she was. She was two years old and she couldn't even hold her head up,"" Adrianne Stewart said. She didn't know whether Maria would be able to regain use of her muscles, but she knew that the family had a lot of work ahead of them. The orphanage director explained the difficulty of finding a home for Maria and why the Stewarts had been chosen to adopt her. Adrianne Stewart said that on hearing this, she felt inspired by her daughter's story, and it made the family realize how lucky they were to have her. A story of joy The Stewarts have received mostly positive responses since sharing their daughter's story. Adrianne Stewart hopes it will inspire other families to consider adoption, both domestically and abroad. ""She has given us far more than we will ever give her. She is so full of joy and light, and is an inspiration to all who meet her,"" she wrote in the Facebook post. ""We put limits on her abilities and then we see her doing exactly what we thought she was not capable of. We are so blessed to have her in our family."" Adrianne Stewart has also received comments from women who had abortions because their fetuses had similar conditions and regretted their decisions after seeing the life that Maria has now. She hopes that her story will inspire other women who may be in similar situations to reconsider. Every now and then, someone will question why she chose to adopt a child internationally instead of in the United States. Stewart contends that there are many kids around the world who need homes and that it doesn't really matter where they come from. A story of love After a rough time during her first years, Maria now lives a happy life full of love. Her family is grateful for Maria and says she is blessing.  ""She has made each of us better. She has taught us to find joy in small things, to not be sad or disappointed by what we don't have, and to not take for granted the things we do have. The most important thing she has taught us is that we are all so much more capable than we think we are."" Adrianne Stewart wrote. Maria continues to receive speech and occupational therapy each month and attends preschool twice a week in a mixed classroom setting where she interacts with both children with and without special needs. Although she still does not speak much, she loves interacting and playing with her classmates. And like every normal child, she enjoys coloring, playing with her stuffed animals and occasionally even rocking out to '80s music.

2017-02-21 16:41:00,2017,2.0,21,What the Future of HPV Looks Like Under Trump,"We're still waiting to see how exactly the Trump administration will replace Obamacare, but one thing already appears certain: Sexual health is unlikely to be a big priority, with plans to defund Planned Parenthood and ditch no-cost birth control already in motion. One question that arises—among many—is what such a repeal could mean for HPV, the most commonly spread STI in the United States. Given the increasing influence of anti-vaxxers on the GOP's agenda, it's not out of the question to imagine that coverage of the HPV shot could be at risk—despite the fact that it can help prevent cancer, and has been proven to lead to less risky sexual behavior. And up until now, the ACA and the HPV vaccine have paired well together. A 2015 study found that Obamacare had a generally positive impact on getting people vaccinated: It's estimated that 1.1 million women initiated the series of treatments, and another 854,000 completed them. (Ideally, boys and girls get two doses at age 11 or 12, and it protects them against the nine strains of HPV that cause certain cancers—cervical, anal, penile and genital warts.)Read more on Tonic",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d753wk/what-the-future-of-hpv-looks-like-under-trump-412,Health,Vice,health,190

2018-01-02 23:39:00,2018,1.0,2,At-Home STD Tests Could Help More People Get Screened," Londoners were almost twice as likely to get checked for sexually transmitted infections when given the option to mail in samples of their biological material than they were when given info about nearby walk-in clinics, according to a new study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Researchers expected that e-STI testing, as it’s called in the study, would be more popular, because of both the convenience and complete privacy it offers. “It’s rapidly developing. You see ads for it all over the tube,” says Paula Baraitser, a co-author of the study and a sexual health researcher at King’s College London. Nonetheless, Baraitser says there’s a perception that telemedicine is “for high-flying executives”—people who don’t have the time to get medical services in person. She and her cohorts wanted to quantify how much more effective e-STI testing is at getting people screened when the option is presented to average Londoners. The researchers went to two low-socioeconomic boroughs, Lambeth and Southwark, which past research had shown to have the highest STI rates in London, Baraitser says. They scoured streets, pubs, markets, barbershops, and other public places for people ages 16 to 30, the prime fornication years in the UK, apparently. Researchers presented themselves as public health clinicians and asked the bystanders if they’d had at least one sexual partner in the last year. (Baraitser says this wasn’t as awkward or giggle-eliciting as you may expect. “People are concerned about STIs and are serious when getting information about them,” she says.) Watch More from Tonic: If they said they’d gotten some action in the past 12 months, a researcher asked them for their phone number. The researchers collected more than 2,000 people’s numbers and, at random, they received a text with either a link to information about e-STI testing or a list of seven walk-in clinics plus contact information. People who chose to take an e-STI test received kits in the mail from SH:24. They sent in blood samples and either urine collections or vaginal swabs, depending on gender and got results back via text message or a phone call. (People were free to use whatever testing method they wanted and some people given info about mail-in testing actually chose the face-to-face route.) Six weeks later, the researchers asked people if they’d gotten tested and checked that answer against their records (participants opted into this). They found that 50 percent of people who got info about e-STI testing followed through, but only 26.6 percent of people who were told about their local clinics showed up to get tested. So, offering e-testing alongside traditional methods led to almost twice as many people getting tested. People in the e-STI testing group were diagnosed with an infection in 2.8 percent of cases, and the walk-in-clinic group in 1.4 percent of instances. The authors say it’s the first study to investigate whether people would use e-testing for syphilis, HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. The team fell short of its recruitment target of 3,000 people so the group wasn’t large enough for them to analyze differences in the STIs diagnosed and treatment rates; it’s something that needs further research. But Baraitser says the message is clear: Give people more access to STI testing and it will increase the rate of screening. She adds that one important step in getting people to use the e-STI tests was explaining that they’re just as effective as what’s offered when you go to a clinic. “These are not separate services,” Baraitser says. “It’s just a different modality of care, and if more people knew about it, we could increase access to this service.” Read This Next: Finally, the Amazon Prime of STD Testing Is Here",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vby78y/twice-as-many-people-took-at-home-std-tests,Health,Vice,health,615
2019-12-18 00:00:00,2019,12.0,18,"Micron signals recovery in 2020, says received supply licenses for Huawei","(Reuters) - Micron Technology Inc said on Wednesday it expected a recovery in 2020 after a “cyclical bottom” in the second quarter, and that it had received all requested licenses to supply some products to its largest customer, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. Shares of Micron rose nearly 4% in extended trading, after its quarterly earnings beat Wall Street estimates on an uptick in demand for memory chips after a tepid year. Struggling to grow sales in a slowing memory market, Micron faced more uncertainty when Washington placed Huawei on a so-called entity list in May that effectively banned U.S. firms from supplying to the Chinese company. Wednesday’s announcement about Huawei licenses comes amid a tepid forecast for the second quarter, but Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrotra said he expected the business to recover in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. “Recent trends in our business give us optimism that our fiscal second quarter will mark the bottom for our financial performance ... with continued recovery in the second half of calendar 2020,” Mehrotra told analysts on a post-earnings call. In June, Micron said it had determined that some of its products could be legally shipped to Huawei, while others remained barred. It did not, however, disclose if it had received a license when U.S. officials began granting them in November. The chipmaker said on Wednesday it had received all requested licenses that enable it to provide support for certain products and qualify new products for Huawei’s mobile and server businesses. The licenses are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s revenue in the next couple of quarters, Micron said. Sumit Sadana, Micron’s chief business officer, told Reuters in an interview it would take time for Micron to work with Huawei to make sure its chips work in Huawei’s newest phones. “We believe that we’ll be able to get back to working with them and qualifying our products, and then within a few months we should be in a much better place - assuming of course that no changes occur in terms of the U.S. trade policy as it relates to Huawei,” Sadana said. The Idaho-based company forecast second-quarter revenue between $4.5 billion and $4.8 billion, while analysts were expecting $4.78 billion. Chipmakers have faced a harrowing 17 months as United States and China traded tariff blows that reduced access to the Chinese market - one of the largest for U.S. companies. For the first quarter, Micron earned 48 cents per share on an adjusted basis, a cent above expectations. Net income attributable to the company fell to $491 million in the quarter ended Nov. 28, from $3.29 billion a year earlier. Revenue also fell to $5.14 billion from $7.91 billion, but beat estimates of $5.01 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

2016-10-27 00:00:00,2016,10.0,27,More evidence cranberries don't prevent urinary tract infections,"By Andrew M. Seaman (Reuters Health) - Over the course of a year, taking cranberry capsules did nothing to stave off urinary tract infections (UTIs) among older women living in nursing homes, a U.S. study finds. Women taking the capsules had just as many UTIs and infection-promoting factors in their urine as women taking inert placebo pills, researchers conclude. “I think it reinforces what many of the other studies have said so far,” said lead author Dr. Manisha Juthani-Mehta, of the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. Previous studies on the use of cranberry products like juice and capsules produced mixed results. A systematic look at that evidence published in 2012 by the Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates and reviews medical research, concluded “cranberry juice cannot currently be recommended for the prevention of UTIs.” Originally, it was thought that eating or drinking cranberry products increased the acidity of urine and prevented UTIs. There was also speculation that a compound in cranberries known as proanthocyanidin prevented bacteria from adhering to the bladder wall. For the new study, the researchers randomly assigned 185 women over 65 years old living in 21 nursing homes near Yale to take pills every day. The participants received either two capsules containing cranberry extracts including a total of 72 milligrams of proanthocyanidin, the equivalent of a person drinking a 20-ounce bottle of cranberry juice, or they got look-alike dummy pills. At the start of the study, about a third of the women had positive urine tests for bacteria and white blood cells, which doesn’t mean the women had UTIs but these are needed elements for an infection to occur. The researchers had a year of data on 147 women. The other women either died, withdrew from the study or were discharged from the nursing home. Overall, there was no difference between women who took cranberry pills or placebos in the proportion who had bacteria and white blood cells in their urine at the end of the study period. Additionally, there was no difference between the two groups in the share of women who experienced symptomatic UTIs, died, were sent to hospitals or used antibiotics. The results were published in JAMA to coincide with their presentation at the infectious disease conference known as IDWeek, which is being held in New Orleans. “It is time to move on from cranberries,” writes Dr. Lindsay Nicolle in an editorial accompanying the new study. “The continuing promotion of cranberry use to prevent recurrent UTI in the popular press or online advice seems inconsistent with the reality of repeated negative studies or positive studies compromised by methodological shortcomings,” writes Nicolle, of the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. Juthani-Mehta told Reuters Health that there is probably little downside to people eating or drinking cranberry products if they like, but she wouldn’t recommend those as a way to prevent UTIs - especially among older adults who may be on a fixed income. “Capsules can range from not a lot of money to $200 per month for a 30-day supply,” she said. For UTI prevention, Juthani-Mehta said there are a couple approaches people - especially women - can take, including making sure they stay hydrated. “In terms of prevention, hydration is certainly important,” she said. “The other factor in post-menopausal women is topical estrogen therapy among women who had recurrent UTIs. It has shown some benefit.” “We may not have a study to say drinking water can prevent UTIs, but that’s really what I recommend,” she said.

Telia Co AB, Telenor ASA, 3 Sweden and Tele2 AB subsequently confirmed the raids. The Commission said it was not taking further action. “On the basis of the evidence found, the Commission concluded there was no sufficient grounds to pursue this preliminary investigation,” the EU executive said in a statement. Earlier on Monday, Tele2 said the Commission had closed the probe. “Today, the European Commission has informed Tele2 that the investigation has been closed without any further action,” Tele2 said in a statement.

2016-04-13 00:00:00,2016,4.0,13,Sean Parker's $250 Million Plan to Annihilate Cancer,"Immune cells can be trained to kill tumors. Image: imuc.comSean Parker, the billionaire co-founder of Napster and the first president of Facebook, announced a $250 million initiative to accelerate the development of effective cancer treatments—and he’s asking the country’s top scientists to pitch in and openly share their research findings. Sean Parker. Image: Amager/Flickr CC BY-SA 2.0The new initiative, called the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, will include over 40 research labs and more than 300 researchers from six key cancer centers, including New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering, Stanford Medicine, the University of California, and others. More are expected to sign on. The institute’s primary focus will be on the emerging field of cancer immunotherapy, in which the body’s immune system is recruited to thwart the growth of cancer cells. Unlike conventional research efforts, in which hundreds of research labs compete against each other and rarely share their findings, Parker wants contributing scientists to collaborate. In a way, it’ll be like Napster, the music-sharing website he co-founded; the billionaire philanthropist wants his institute to act as a hub from which critical research data is shared. But more importantly, this research won’t just idly rest on the pages of medical journals. Parker wants to see these findings quickly translated to actually therapies. “Any breakthrough made at one center is immediately available to another center without any kind of IP (intellectual property) entanglements or bureaucracy,” noted Parker in an interview with Reuters. Parker is frustrated with the slow progress being made in cancer research, and he’s applying his entrepreneurial experience to remedy the problem. The Parker Institute will encourage scientists to borrow from each other’s labs. Home institutions will continue to conduct their own research, but they’ll receive additional funding and access to other resources. Each participating university will have a representative on a centralized scientific screening committee. Some critics worry that this model will introduce “group think” to cancer research, thwarting innovation and out-of-the-box thinking. In defense, Parker says a central principle behind the institute will be “freedom of innovation in concert with collaboration.” A revenue sharing model will also be put in place to maintain incentive, and as a way to fund future research. Parker himself will take an active role in managing the institute; he says he’s going to be very hands on.The Parker Institute will have its own central staff of about 50, and will facilitate the patenting of inventions and requisite licensing. It could even launch spin-out companies. One expert described the unconventional model as “academic biopharma.” Though technically not a biotech firm, the institute will drive discoveries towards drug development. In addition to the contributing cancer centers, the effort will include partnerships with patient advocacy groups, as well as over two-dozen private companies, such as Merck, Genentech, and Grail. The Parker Institute, which will be based in San Francisco, will focus on three key research areas: modifying immune cells to target tumors, boosting patient response to current immunotherapy drugs, and identifying other targets to attack tumors. Immunotherapy, which many experts believe is the future of cancer therapy, re-trains the body’s immune cells to attack and destroy certain types of cancer. It can be done by stimulating a patient’s immune system to work harder to attack cancer cells, or it can be done by boosting a patient’s immune system with synthetic proteins. Early results have been promising, with some studies showing significant increases in survival rates and disease-free periods. Research has shown that efficacy of immunotherapies are enhanced by upwards of 20 to 30 percent when combined with traditional treatments, such as chemotherapy. Recently, an immunotherapeutic drug called pembrolizumab was credited for the success of Jimmy Carter’s cancer treatment. It’s a promising idea, but one that will require considerable work—and funding. According to the Parker Institute:Immunotherapy-related research will receive less than 4% of the National Cancer Institute’s $4.9 billion cancer research budget in 2015, and the pharmaceutical industry’s R&D pipeline remains significantly focused on novel chemo and “targeted” agents.The new institute is the most ambitious effort to combat a disease since Bill and Melinda Gates announced their effort to tackle malaria. Parker’s interest in cancer—a problem he describes as being inherently “hackable”—was sparked by the death of Laura Ziskin, a film producer and friend who died of breast cancer three years ago.

2016-10-10 00:00:00,2016,10.0,10,How not to raise a mean girl," (CNN)I am one of the lucky ones. I didn't meet my first ""mean girl"" until freshman year of college. Before I met her -- let's call her ""Z"" -- I lived life assuming that people would, for the most part, treat me the way I treated them. Oh, how wrong I was. Z was close to my freshman roommate, who was the opposite of a mean girl, but whenever Z was around, it was clear that a) she had no time for me and b) I was not welcome in anything she was doing. To this day, whenever I think of mean girls, I think back to Z and wonder what led her to be so miserable to me and probably other girls, too. I find myself thinking about that question a lot lately as I watch my daughters, now 6 and 8, negotiate female friendships. Sadly, I have already seen mean girl qualities in some girls in their peer group, and my kids are still years away from middle school! Pink, princess-y and sexy too soon Educational psychologist Lori Day says the problem is growing worse with the increasing power of the Internet and today's hyperfeminine girl culture, so we're seeing more mean girls today and at younger ages. Here's where we as parents need to slam on the brakes. If the problem is getting worse and it's starting with girls as young as elementary school, what can we do about it? How can we avoid raising mean girls? Day, who is out with the powerful new book ""Her Next Chapter: How Mother-Daughter Book Clubs Can Help Girls Navigate Malicious Media, Risky Relationships, Girl Gossip and So Much More,"" says mothers really have to ""model being allies to other women."" ""When girls see their mother gossiping with a female friend about another female friend, putting down someone because of how they look or their weight ... it's modeling the wrong thing for girls,"" she said. She recommends being explicit with young girls about this philosophy. ""You can say, 'I really try not to tear other women down. I try to build them up,' "" said Day, who wrote the book along with her recent college graduate daughter and devoted an entire chapter to dealing with mean girls. Opinion: Are women mean or just stating the facts? Louise Sattler, a school psychologist, sign language educator and mom of two grown children in Los Angeles, knows all too well about mean girls. When she was in high school, one girl, we'll call her ""C,"" seemed to have it out for her. Thirty years later, at her high school reunion, C continued to be a bully, even requesting that Sattler not sit at her table. (Sattler, you'll be happy to know, did not back down. She planted her purse and her body down at that table, and C stormed off.) ""I always felt kind of sorry for her, frankly, because I knew she didn't come from a very happy household,"" she said. Girls like C are always looking for something better and for recognition and validation, she added. ""And so I think the way to combat mean girls is to first just validate your daughter. They may not be the cheerleader. They may not grow up to be the smartest. They may be a little chunky, but that's OK."" Mean girls often have a low self-esteem and ""a feeling of mistrust and negative competition with other girls,"" said Anea Bogue, an author, educator and self-esteem expert who focuses her energies on helping girls. People who truly feel good about themselves don't expend a ton of energy trying to knock others down, said Bogue, author of ""9 Ways We're Screwing Up Our Girls and How We Can Stop."" ""The most important thing we can do as parents to avoid raising a mean girl is instill self-value and challenge status quo messages of female inferiority and mistrust between women, a norm girls learn about from the time they are little from a variety of sources, including fairy tales,"" said the mom of two girls, who recently launched an anti-bullying program in the U.S. and Hong Kong called Be a REALgirl, not a MEANgirl. The upside of selfies: Social media isn't all bad for kids Annette Lanteri, a mom of two girls in Bayport, New York, switched schools for her elder daughter in part because of the way she was being treated by some mean girls. The key in stopping this behavior, she says is teaching children the concept of empathy. ""Having the ability to step into someone's shoes and use that information when you interact with people is an amazing tool,"" Lanteri said. ""A girl with that empathizes with others, especially her peers, (and) will never become a mean girl."" What I also heard from the many parents I spoke with is that the golden rule that we all grew up with -- treat others as you would want them to treat you -- is perhaps even more important today. Kids viral bullying shows how frustrated parents can get Michelle Staruiala has been passing that philosophy down to her three kids, including her 13-year-old daughter, their entire lives. It works, she said. Her daughter hasn't had issues with mean girls, has been known to stand up for friends who are being bullied and feels guilty if she ever treats someone the wrong way. ""To this day, my daughter will say, 'Mom, I shouldn't have said that. I feel bad I said this about my friend,' "" said Staruiala, of Saskatchewan. Then again, maybe we're going about this mean girl policing all wrong. Amy MacClain, lead facilitator and program developer for Soul Shoppe, an interactive program focusing on helping schools and students combat bullying, says we should banish the term entirely. Saddling a kid with the mean girl tag means judging her in the same way she may be judging others, said MacClain, who is also the founder of a program that helps parents bully-proof their kids. ""If you turn and go, 'She's a mean girl. You better go and play with someone else,' you're teaching your child not to deal with the problem, not to see what might be the cause and not to take care of themselves."" Truly stopping mean girl behavior demands a lot of parental introspection. After all, what parent would want to admit their daughter is one? ""Part of it is we're just so blamed as parents ... for the normal things that kids can do. That's why we don't want to take any responsibility,"" said MacClain, who has an 11-year-son. But denial isn't going to help anyone, parents and parenting experts say, so the best thing any mom of a mean girl can do is start validating her daughter and connecting with her, even on the playground. ""When there are girls and they're being mean to one another, get involved,"" MacClain said. ""Go to the park where they play and jump into that play and lead it for a little while so that all the girls feel safer and they're having fun so you're not directing it. You're just jumping in and leading fun."" ",https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/10/health/mean-girls-how-not-to-raise-one-parents/index.html,health,CNN,health,1195
2016-05-04 09:00:00,2016,5.0,4,Researchers Are Working to Replace Japan’s Rural Workforce With Drones,"""Ever since a mildly 'radioactive' drone landed on the roof of the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's official residence last year, the Japanese public has had a really negative view towards drones,"" Shoki Obara, a student from Keio University's drone research lab, told me in Kanagawa prefecture just south of Tokyo.  ""We're trying to change the public's perception by sparking their interest in the other ways that drones can be used—for example, in entertainment, racing, or to support healthcare,"" he added.  Launched in 2015 on Christmas day, the Drone Research Consortium is headed up by Tomoyuki Furutani, a professor of policy management. The group's aims are two-fold: They want to win over the Japanese public's interest in drones and explore how UAVs could be integrated into the Japanese workforce. ""We want to look into how drones could be used to deliver commodities, medication, or even blood to homes or hospitals in rural areas,"" Furutani explained.  The Japanese population is rapidly decreasing, with a reduction of nearly one million people since 2010 and few measures to accept immigrants en masse. Robotics researchers in the country are turning to everything from robots to drones to prepare for future labor shortages as they contend with an increasingly silver population. ""In the past we used cars or trucks to deliver commodities, but as it will become harder to find people to man these vehicles, we can use drones, as they will be cheaper and faster,"" said Furutani. In February 2015, the Japanese government carried out a test exercise where drones were used to deliver food to old people living in rural areas, with hopes to have the service up and running by 2018. As Obara—who took part in the first World Drone Prix in Dubai in March 2016—piloted a small DJI drone in a leafy green area behind the main campus, we discussed how drones might play an important role in closing the rural and urban divide. Yet he concluded that even if there was an app through which products could be selected and drones called for delivery, old people living in the countryside might not own or know how to use a smartphone.  Furutani also wants his university's drone tech to benefit the farming community. He said that farming methods in the US differed to those in Japan, where farmers were used to working in smaller or more mountainous lands.  ""In Japan, you could have drones patrolling smaller fields, using sensors and 3D modelling techniques to show farmers how big their oranges or tea leaves growing on steeper slopes have become,"" he suggested. ""It's hard for farmers to go to climb steep mountains so you can send the drones out there to monitor the land at a lower cost—in that way we can optimize agriculture."" In 2017, Japanese startup Spread will open the world's first robotic farm to contend with labour shortages and to experiment with more sustainable ways of growing crops. With the Japanese population depleting, Furutani is also thinking of possible solutions for the eventual loss of human farmers in rural areas in Japan. ""When the farmers are gone, we can make a control center and send out drones and things from there. People could be sent out there during the harvest, or robots could actually do that too,"" said Furutani. While there's a level of anxiety over in the US and Europe over robots pinching people's jobs, Furutani remained largely optimistic of the role that robots would play in Japan in the future. ""In Japan, as the labor force is shrinking, robots will be stepping in as our substitutes,"" he added.

2019-07-16 23:00:09,2019,7.0,16,Elon Musk’s Neuralink Wants ‘Sewing Machine-Like’ Robots to Wire Brains to the Internet,"SAN FRANCISCO — Elon Musk aspires to make inserting a computer connection into your brain as safe and painless as Lasik eye surgery. On Tuesday evening, Neuralink, a company in which Mr. Musk has invested $100 million, detailed the baby steps it has taken toward that goal. Neuralink described a “sewing machine-like” robot that can implant ultrathin threads deep into the brain. The company is hoping to begin working with human subjects as soon as the second quarter of next year. The company claims the system will eventually be capable of reading and writing vast amounts of information. But as with many of Mr. Musk’s other ventures, like spaceships or futuristic tunnels, one of the biggest challenges may be for his scientists to match his grand vision. Mr. Musk, the billionaire chief executive of the electric carmaker Tesla who has famously claimed that he “wants to die on Mars, just not on impact,” has a reputation for doing bold things, as well as making even bolder claims that stretch credulity. [Get the Bits newsletter for the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.] Like artificial intelligence, the idea of inserting a device into the brain that would allow speedy communication between humans and computers veers quickly into science fantasy. In his 1984 science-fiction novel “Neuromancer,” William Gibson posited the idea of something he called a “microsoft,” a small cartridge directly connected to the brain via a socket to provide a human user with instant knowledge, such as a new language. In a briefing on Monday, Neuralink executives acknowledged they had a “long way to go” before they could begin to offer a commercial service. But they were ready to discuss their work publicly. Mr. Musk was not at the meeting. “We want this burden of stealth mode off of us so that we can keep building and do things like normal people, such as publish papers,” said Max Hodak, Neuralink’s president and one of the company’s founders. Mr. Musk has been active in trying to help solve the engineering challenges that Neuralink faces, according to Shivon Zilis, project director at Neuralink. The company has received $158 million in funding and has 90 employees. While the most fantastical visions for a brain-computer may be a long way off, Mr. Musk may have found a potential medical use. Mr. Hodak shared Mr. Musk’s optimism that Neuralink technology might one day — relatively soon — help humans with an array of ailments, like helping amputees regain mobility or helping people hear, speak and see. The company says surgeons would have to drill holes through the skull to implant the threads. But in the future, they hope to use a laser beam to pierce the skull with a series of tiny holes. “One of the big bottlenecks is that a mechanical drill couples vibration through the skull, which is unpleasant, whereas a laser drill, you wouldn’t feel,” Mr. Hodak said. They plan to work with neurosurgeons at Stanford University and possibly other institutions to conduct early experiments. Jaimie Henderson, a professor of neurosurgery at Stanford and a specialist in the treatment of epilepsy and the use of a treatment known as Deep Brain Stimulation, is an adviser to Neuralink, according to Mr. Hodak. In a demonstration at a Neuralink research lab on Monday, the company showed a system connected to a laboratory rat reading information from 1,500 electrodes — 15 times better than current systems embedded in humans. That’s enough for scientific research or medical applications. Independent scientists cautioned that results from laboratory animals might not translate into human success and that human trials would be required to determine the technology’s promise. Recently, the most advanced data for animal studies has come from the Belgian company Imec and its Neuropixels technology, which has a device capable of gathering data from thousands of separate brains cells at once. One of Neuralink’s distinguishing techniques is that it places flexible threads of electrodes in proximity to neurons, the tiny cells that are the basic building blocks of the brain. The ability to capture information from a large number of cells and then send it wirelessly to a computer for later analysis is believed to be an important step to improving basic understanding of the brain. The threads are placed using thin needles, and a so-called computer-vision system helps avoid blood vessels on the surface of the brain. The technique being used by Neuralink involves inserting a bundle of threads that are each about a quarter of the diameter of a human hair. The flexible threads are actually thin sandwiches of a cellophane-like material that insulates conductive wires that link a series of minute electrodes, or sensors, much like a strand of pearls. They can be inserted in different locations and to different depths, depending on the experiment or application. Medical research and therapy may focus on different parts of the brain, such as centers for speech, vision, hearing or motion. The flexibility of the Neuralink threads would be an advance, said Terry Sejnowski, the Francis Crick Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, in La Jolla, Calif. However, he noted that the Neuralink researchers still needed to prove that the insulation of their threads could survive for long periods in a brain’s environment, which has a salt solution that deteriorates many plastics. Neuralink is certain to have plenty of competition. Over the past decade, the Pentagon has financed research both for basic brain sciences and to develop robotic control systems that would permit brain control of prosthetic devices. Researchers with funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency already have been able to create interfaces allowing quadriplegics to independently manipulate robot arms to perform manual tasks like drinking. The Pentagon has financed a variety of techniques, including approaches that use light rather than embedded electrodes to capture data.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/technology/neuralink-elon-musk.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,973
2017-11-07 14:56:00,2017,11.0,7,The US Is the Last Country to Remain Outside the Paris Climate Agreement,"It's official, the US is number one. And by that I mean the only country in the world to not participate in the Paris climate accord now that Syria agreed to sign the agreement at the United Nations talks in Bonn, Germany today. Earlier, Syria and Nicaragua had both held back from the agreement—a pact to limit carbon emissions—alongside the US, but for different reasons. Syria, as you might have heard, is dealing with a brutal civil war. Nicaraguan leaders, meanwhile, said the Paris accord didn't go far enough to address climate change concerns, but decided to climb on board in October. But President Donald Trump decided to leave the agreement*, signed and ratified under Barack Obama, in June. Trump cited some interesting reasons for not wanting to be held to the same standards as the rest of the world. In his June remarks, he said he wanted to protect the country from ""the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country"" and legal implications.  Read More: Are We All Screwed If the US Leaves the Paris Climate Agreement There are actually no legally binding clauses in the agreement, and the US, under Obama, pledged less per capita to offset carbon emissions than countries like Sweden, the UK, and Japan. Trump, who said he wanted to negotiate the terms of a new agreement, also called the US a world leader in environmental protection, and said leaving the agreement wouldn't change the country's commitment to the environment. But the US is the second largest contributor to global carbon emissions, according to organizations like the Union of Concerned Scientists. And it's home to an increasingly anti-science administration and an environmental agency official who thinks the air is ""too clean."" The Paris agreement isn't perfect. Many critics say it has no teeth, since countries can balk on their commitments without repercussions. But it's also the largest international treaty to itemize and plan for collective climate change action and provide some sort of road map to decreasing our emissions. And we don't exactly have time not to be taking action.  For the US to be the only country in the world to abstain from a global climate agreement, then, is not a symbolic gesture. It's a middle finger to the entire world.  Editor's Note: While Trump announced his plan to withdraw in June, but it takes three to four years to permanently leave the agreement.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa3qjb/us-is-officially-the-last-country-to-remain-outside-the-paris-climate-agreement-syria-signs,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,404
2016-06-21 00:00:00,2016,6.0,21,WHO weighs emergency measure to stretch yellow fever vaccine," (CNN)In Angola, the worst outbreak of yellow fever in three decades may result in a vaccine shortage. If this happens, fractional dosing -- giving one-fifth the standard amount of vaccine -- could be used to control an outbreak of the viral hemorrhagic disease, according to a group of experts convened by the World Health Organization.  In Angola, just under 3,300 people have been infected with yellow fever since December, and at least 347 people have died. The outbreak began in the capital city, Luanda, but has spread to at least 16 of the country's 18 provinces. The majority of cases are among males between the ages of 9 and 19 years old. Health officials are concerned it could spread to areas where people are not vaccinated, including  the neighboring countries of Namibia and Zambia.  ""The massive vaccination activities have reached more than 10 million people. However, new cases continue to be reported, indicating that some pockets of unvaccinated people still exist,"" the WHO said in its latest report on the outbreak (PDF), released Monday.  After reviewing all existing data, the WHO's advisory group, which was tasked with considering potential vaccine shortages, said that one-fifth the dose would still provide protection for 12 months, possibly longer. A standard dose of the vaccine offers lifelong protection against this disease, which is transmitted by infected mosquitoes.  Symptoms include fever, headache, jaundice, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. A small proportion of patients develop severe symptoms, and nearly half of these die within 10 days. The yellow fever supply in an emergency (PDF) Imported cases of yellow fever through non-immunized travelers have occurred in three countries: the Democratic Republic of Congo (59 cases), Kenya (two cases) and China (11 cases).   The outbreak of yellow fever in Congo was declared April 23. The total number of suspected cases there appears to have recently spiked. As of June 8, WHO reports reflected only three probable cases and 57 laboratory-confirmed cases in Congo; as of June 20, the WHO had received reports of 1,106 cases (68 confirmed) with 75 deaths.   Six additional countries -- Brazil, Chad, Colombia, Ghana, Peru and Uganda -- are reporting either yellow fever outbreaks or sporadic cases not linked to the Angolan outbreak, according to the WHO. Emergency vaccination campaigns to control the outbreak in Angola and its spread to Congo have placed unprecedented demands on the vaccine supply.  More than 15 million doses of vaccine have been delivered to Angola and Congo, the WHO reported on Wednesday.  ""Right now, we have enough vaccines in the global stockpile to cope with the ongoing outbreaks if there are no further extensions,"" said Dr. Jon Abramson, chairman of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization.  Given continuing infections in Angola and the potential for an outbreak in Kinshasa, Congo's capital city of 11.6 million people, experts have begun to consider a new dose-sparing strategy. They have to plan now because the vaccine, which is made by four companies, takes about 12 months to produce.  The stockpile usually has 6 million doses of the yellow fever vaccine, but that supply has been depleted twice this year. Usually, only 4 million doses are needed to quell an outbreak in one country. This situation, the WHO said, is a first.    The vaccine, which provides immunity within 30 days for 99% of people vaccinated, is safe and affordable. Abramson and his colleagues say more research is needed to see whether fractional doses would be effective in young children, who may have a weaker immune response to the vaccine. The vaccine was developed in the 1930s by Max Theiler, who earned a Nobel Prize for his work. It's been in use since 1937, and more than 650 million doses have been distributed in the past 75 years. The virus is endemic in tropical areas of 47 countries in Africa and Central and South America. Since 2006, more than 105 million people have been vaccinated in mass campaigns.  According to the WHO, there are an estimated 84,000 and 170,000 severe cases of yellow fever worldwide each year, and as many as 60,000 of those cases are fatal.  Formal recommendations on the use of lower doses of vaccine by the expert committee are expected in October. In the interim, it has found sufficient evidence that fractional dosing could be effective to control urban outbreaks in situations of a temporary vaccine shortage. Practical issues need further investigation, though, including obtaining suitable syringes to administer the vaccine, which is injected into a muscle or just under the skin.

In many instances, their company wined and dined doctors at fancy restaurants, took some on private jet trips and even provided some with prostitutes, one brother testified. In many instances, their company wined and dined doctors at fancy restaurants, took some on private jet trips and even provided some with prostitutes, one brother testified. That brother, David Nicoll, 44, was considered the mastermind behind the seven-year scheme. He received a six-year sentence for his role in a fraud authorities say was one of the largest of its kind ever uncovered. David&aposs younger brother, Scott, received a 43-month sentence. Both sentences were far below the 25-year combined maximum sentences the brothers faced after they pleaded guilty in 2013 to conspiracy to bribe doctors and money laundering through their New Jersey company, Biodiagnostic Laboratory Services. Their subsequent cooperation with the government helped prosecutors earn more than 50 guilty pleas or convictions. ""There can be little doubt that your conduct was the most egregious conduct that occurred in this case,"" U.S. District Judge Stanley Chesler told David Nicoll. ""You were the center of this operation and you were at the core of this spider web that you wove. You took a company that was making nothing and you made yourself a big fortune.

Within a year, the Nicoll brothers were bribing doctors to steer blood samples to BLS for testing. The brothers&apos incomes drastically increased. Their scheme, which occurred between 2006 and 2013, involved signing bogus agreements to rent office space in doctors&apos offices. When New Jersey law discontinued that practice, they switched to bribing doctors with bogus consultant agreements paid for by shell corporations formed specifically for that purpose. Nicoll testified last year that he dealt with ""probably hundreds"" of doctors during his years at BLS. When asked how many had been bribed, he replied: ""The large majority."" The U.S. attorney&aposs office estimated at least $100 million of the revenue the company made between 2006 and 2013 derived from the bribery scheme. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

2018-07-20 00:00:00,2018,7.0,20,Bayer Will Soon Stop U.S. Sales of Controversial Birth Control Implant Essure,"The North American headquarters of Bayer, located in New Jersey.Photo:  Julio Cortez (AP)A controversial birth control treatment that is alleged to have harmed thousands of women in the past two decades is finally being phased out completely. On Friday, the pharmacy Bayer announced it would stop selling its Essure birth control implant within the U.S. by December 31 of this year. It follows a similar move by the company to end sales everywhere else in the world, including Europe, in 2017.Approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2002, Essure prevents pregnancy through the use of two metal coils that are respectively inserted into each fallopian tube of the uterus. The coils are thought to irritate uterine tissue, causing scarring that blocks sperm from reaching the egg.Upon its debut in 2002, Essure was marketed as a permanent, drug-free, and safe birth control option with a 90 percent success rate. But people have reported serious complications with its use. The implant can cause punctures in the fallopian tubes or other parts of the uterus; it can also leave the uterus and end up trapped in the pelvis or abdomen, causing pain or triggering allergies. Both types of complications typically require surgical removal.Following outcry by patients and doctors, the FDA required Bayer to place a black box warning on its product in 2016. This April, following more discussion with Essure critics, the agency took things a step further. They ordered Bayer to place a label that would require health care providers to only provide the implant after they first discussed the risks with their patients. Both the patient and doctor would then have to sign a document confirming they had talked.In the end, the bad publicity and hoops Bayer had to jump through to keep selling Essure proved too much of a hassle: The company cited the dramatic decline in U.S. sales in recent years as part of its reasoning to stop Essure production (according to the FDA, sales have dropped 70 percent since the black box warning was added). However, Bayer balked at admitting any wrongdoing in how it sold Essure and stood by its safety record.“The health and safety of the patients who rely on our products is our top priority,” the company said. “Most importantly, we want to let the many women who have chosen Essure for their reproductive health know that our decision to discontinue sales is for business reasons, and not for any safety or efficacy concerns about Essure.”Along with the FDA’s labeling change in 2016, the agency also demanded Bayer conduct a post-market study of Essure patients. And despite the pending end of Essure sales, Bayer said it will continue to enroll patients in the study. Originally, the study would have tracked the health of 2,000 women newly given an implant for three years.“Since Bayer will not be able to meet its expected enrollment numbers for this study,” FDA chief Scott Gottlieb said in a statement, “we’ll be working with the company to best determine how to move forward to answer the critical questions we posed concerning certain patient complications that may be experienced by patients who have Essure.”Women who are currently using Essure to successfully prevent pregnancy with no serious health problems, Gottlieb said, should feel safe to continue doing so. Women who experience any possibly related symptoms, such as chronic pain, should consult a doctor to decide their next step, he added.According to Bayer, more than 200,000 women worldwide have used Essure since it became available.[FDA]",https://gizmodo.com/bayer-will-soon-stop-u-s-sales-of-controversial-birth-1827756000,Health,Gizmodo,health,582

SpongeBob memes, this generation's  Seinfeld for having a plot point for everything, surely makes the cut for whatever digital time capsule we'd construct for the late-twenty-tens.  That's why this GIF, created by 17-year-old Shane Kuhn, looks like it was dug from a vault in the future and sent back to 2017. It's pixelated, silent, and less vibrant than I remember  SpongeBob being when I watched it on TV as a kid. The GIF contains the entirely of ""Help Wanted,"" the 1999 eight-minute  SpongeBob Squarepants pilot episode, run through several compression methods and crammed into Twitter's 15 megabyte file size limit. ""I wanted to find out if an entire episode could be fit into a single GIF, no matter the circumstances,"" Kuhn told me in a Twitter message. ""I selected 'Help Wanted' as the episode to translate into the GIF format due to its iconic nature. I also assumed that most viewers would be able to 'listen' to the rather mute GIF format if they had the dialogue of the episode ingrained in their hearts."" It's true: If you think you don't remember every line of that episode, watching the GIF and letting your mind fill in the Gary meows and Squidward groans might surprise you.  Raw, lossless  SpongeBob episodes have a resolution of 512 by 384 pixels, he told me—when converted straight to GIF, this episode ended up being 175 megabytes. Kuhn needed to get it down to 15 megabytes to post to Twitter, so he re-rendered it in Sony Vegas using the lowest possible resolution that maintained the proper aspect ratio: 192x144 pixels. Still slightly too large, he opened the newly-compressed file in open-source video transcoder HandBrake, and got it down to 80 by 60 pixel resolution and a file size of 13.7 megabytes. He also GIF'd ""Reef Blower,"" the following episode in the first season. It's an almost three-minute short that's nearly dialogue-free. ""Watching full SpongeBob episodes as tiny GIF sounds like an idea that Mr. Krabs would definitely endorse, although I also want to respect Nickelodeon's intellectual property rights as well,"" Kuhn said. ""I have received many requests to do more episodes, and even requests to create a GIF of the  SpongeBob movie. In the words of the magic conch shell, 'Maybe someday.'""

2019-11-29 00:00:00,2019,11.0,29,"Samoa measles toll hits 42 as nations dispatch medical teams, supplies","WELLINGTON (Reuters) - More nations were flying medical staff and supplies to Samoa on Friday to battle a measles outbreak that prompted the Pacific island nation to declare a state of emergency this month, as the death toll rose to 42, most of them children younger than four. A significant drop in immunisation over the last few years has made Samoa highly vulnerable to outbreaks of the disease, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) saying vaccine coverage is just about 31% there. Schools have been shut and a mass vaccination effort launched in the nation of just 200,000 located south of the equator halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand, with its government saying 50,068 people have been vaccinated. The health ministry said 3,149 cases of measles have been reported, with 213 during the last 24 hours. Of 197 victims in hospital, 20 are critically ill children and three are pregnant women, it added. Deaths in the outbreak have now reached 42, the majority of them children under the age of four, the government said. Neighbouring New Zealand said it was sending more supplies and personnel, including emergency medical assistance teams, nurse vaccinators, intensive care specialists and Samoan-speaking medical professionals. “The Samoan health system is under serious strain with growing numbers of people, many of whom are very young, needing complex care as a result of the measles outbreak,” said New Zealand’s foreign minister, Winston Peters. New Zealand would also fund 100,000 more vaccines for measles and rubella, Peters added in a statement. Britain said a group of British doctors and nurses left on Friday to help Samoa’s efforts to rein in the outbreak, while Australia said it had also sent medical personnel and supplies. Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that spreads easily through coughing and sneezing. Other nations in the Pacific, such as Tonga and Fiji, are also grappling with a spike in the number of measles cases. Tonga has said its outbreak followed the return of a squad of its rugby players from New Zealand, where Auckland, the biggest city, is tackling a growing number of cases. Measles cases are rising worldwide, even in wealthy nations such as Germany and the United States, as parents shun immunisation for philosophical or religious reasons, or fears, debunked by doctors, that such vaccines could cause autism.

2019-10-03 15:19:00,2019,10.0,3,First Flu Death of the Season Reported in New Mexico,"A woman in New Mexico has died of the flu, marking the nation’s first death as the flu season begins to ramp up. The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) said Wednesday that the woman was 90-years-old and from Bernalillo County, which covers Albuquerque. The agency also said that she was one of five reported flu cases in the state so far this year. Three of the other cases were from Sandoval County, and one was from Santa Fe County. Health officials urged residents to get the flu vaccines now. “Flu can be fatal if left untreated or if a person – at any age – has a weakened immune system,” said NMDOH Cabinet Secretary Kathy Kunkel. “Getting your flu vaccination every year is the single best way to protect you, your family, and our state’s most vulnerable residents, from infants to the elderly.” The last two flu seasons were difficult in the U.S. The 2017-2018 season was the deadliest in four decades, according to the Centers for Disease Control, with nearly 80,000 deaths. Last year was milder, with 61,200 deaths, but it was the longest flu season in ten years, lasting from November to April. The CDC recommends that people get the flu shot by the end of October for it to be most effective, and to reduce the chance of spreading the flu to others, especially children or the elderly who are more vulnerable. “We know that antibodies peak four to six weeks after getting a vaccine and then slowly go down over the next six months,” Ann Falsey, MD, professor of medicine in the infectious disease unit at the University of Rochester Medical Center, previously told PEOPLE. But if people do not get their shot by the end of the month, they should go whenever they can. And they shouldn’t worry that the vaccine gives them the flu — that’s a myth. “Because the virus is inactive, it absolutely cannot transmit the infection,” Dr. Denise Pate, Internal Medicine Doctor at Medical Offices of Manhattan, previously told PEOPLE. “I think it’s important to recognize the side effects of getting the shot versus what the actual flu is.”  ",https://people.com/health/first-flu-death-of-the-2019-2020-season-reported-in-new-mexico/,health,People,health,359

2019-04-15 00:00:00,2019,4.0,15,France to ask EU partners to adopt its cryptocurrency regulation,"PARIS (Reuters) - France will push for the European Union to adopt a regulatory framework on cryptocurrencies similar to the one it brought in last week at a national level, becoming the first major country to do so, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Monday. The French parliament last week approved a financial sector law that included rules aimed at tempting cryptocurrency issuers and traders to set up in France by giving them some official recognition, while ensuring the country can tax their profits. “I will propose to my European partners that we set up a single regulatory framework on crypto-assets inspired by the French experience,” Le Maire said in Paris at an event on blockchain technology. “Our model is the right one.” The French government’s new cryptocurrency bill - the first of its kind adopted by a major nation - will allow firms that want to issue new cryptocurrencies or trade existing ones to apply for a certification. In most of the world, cryptocurrencies are still either totally unregulated or banned. The certification will be granted by the French market regulator for those who want it, and issuers, traders, custodians and investors will have to pay taxes on profits they make on those securities. The goal is to establish a market in Paris for companies raising capital in this way, allowing France to grab a slice of the expanding business while giving it some oversight of a niche which some fear could be a target for speculators. The European Commission has recently launched a feasibility study on how to regulate the cryptocurrency markets, though no legislation is expected at least until late 2019 as the mandate of the current administration is ending. On unregulated markets, where no rules apply, investors are left totally unprotected if things go sour. Under France’s regulatory proposals, authorities would verify who is behind a new coin’s issuance or a trading platform, and check the companies’ business plans and anti-money laundering rules. The specific requirements companies need to abide by to get the regulatory stamp of approval are still to be defined by government decrees. The certification will give investors basic guarantees against outright fraud, but will not protect them against losses.

2018-09-26 00:00:00,2018,9.0,26,UK healthcare worker contracts rare monkeypox virus in third case,"LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - A health worker in northern England has become the third person in Britain to contract a rare illness caused by a monkeypox virus after caring for a patient infected with the disease following travel to Nigeria, health officials said on Wednesday. The latest patient had been involved in caring for another case at Blackpool Victoria Hospital before monkeypox was diagnosed, Public Health England said in a statement. Monkeypox is a rare viral infection that does not usually spread easily from person to person. The virus is similar to human smallpox, which was eradicated in 1980. Although monkeypox is much milder than smallpox, with most infected people recovering within a few weeks, it can in rare cases be fatal. Health officials said earlier this month that two people in Britain had been diagnosed with monkeypox in separate cases thought to be linked to travel to Nigeria, West Africa. These were the first ever cases of monkeypox in Britain. This third case has been isolated and is being cared for in a specialist unit at Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, northeast England, the statement said. “This healthcare worker cared for the patient before a diagnosis of monkeypox was made,” said Nick Phin of PHE’s National Infection Service. “We have been actively monitoring contacts for 21 days after exposure to detect anyone presenting with an illness so that they can be assessed quickly. It is therefore not wholly unexpected that a case has been identified. “This person has been isolated and we are taking a highly precautionary approach to ensure that all contacts are traced,” he added. Phin had previously said the monkeypox virus was likely to be circulating in Nigeria after a large outbreak there in 2017, and could therefore affect travelers returning to Britain.

2017-03-27 00:00:00,2017,3.0,27,Would legalizing medical marijuana help curb the opioid epidemic?,"(Reuters Health) - In states that legalized medical marijuana, U.S. hospitals failed to see a predicted influx of pot smokers, but in an unexpected twist, they treated far fewer opioid users, a new study shows. Hospitalization rates for opioid painkiller dependence and abuse dropped on average 23 percent in states after marijuana was permitted for medicinal purposes, the analysis found. Hospitalization rates for opioid overdoses dropped 13 percent on average. At the same time, fears that legalization of medical marijuana would lead to an uptick in cannabis-related hospitalizations proved unfounded, according to the report in Drug and Alcohol Dependence. “Instead, medical marijuana laws may have reduced hospitalizations related to opioid pain relievers,” said study author Yuyan Shi, a public health professor at the University of California, San Diego. “This study and a few others provided some evidence regarding the potential positive benefits of legalizing marijuana to reduce opioid use and abuse, but they are still preliminary,” she said in an email. Dr. Esther Choo, a professor of emergency medicine at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, was intrigued by the study’s suggestion that access to cannabis might reduce opioid misuse. “It is becoming increasingly clear that battling the opioid epidemic will require a multi-pronged approach and a good deal of creativity,” Choo, who was not involved in the study, said in an email. “Could increased liberalization of marijuana be part of the solution? It seems plausible.” However, she said, “there is still much we need to understand about the mechanisms through which marijuana policy may affect opioid use and harms.” An estimated 60 percent of Americans now live in the 28 states and Washington, D.C. where medical marijuana is legal under state law. Meanwhile, the opioid epidemic - sparked by a quadrupling since 1999 in sales of prescription painkillers such as Oxycontin and Vicodin - kills 91 Americans a day. Shi analyzed hospitalization records from 1997 through 2014 for 27 states, nine of which implemented medical marijuana policies. Her study was the fifth to show declines in opioid use or deaths in states that allow medical cannabis. Previous studies reported associations between medical marijuana and reductions in opioid prescriptions, opioid-related vehicle accidents and opioid-overdose deaths. In a 2014 study, Dr. Marcus Bachhuber found deaths from opioid overdoses fell by 25 percent in states that legalized medical marijuana. Since last year, when New York rolled out its medical marijuana program, Bachhuber has included cannabis in a menu of options he offers his patients who suffer chronic or severe pain from neuropathy and HIV/AIDS, he said in a phone interview. Bachhuber, a professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, was not involved in the new study. Many of Bachhuber’s patients ask for help quitting highly addictive opioids, and some have used marijuana to taper off the prescription painkillers, he said. Nonetheless, a 1970 federal law puts cannabis in the same category as heroin, Schedule 1 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, and finds it has no medicinal value. Consequently, doctors can only recommend, not prescribe, marijuana, and physicians who work for the federal government cannot even discuss the weed. Federal prohibition also has led to severe limitations on marijuana research. In January, a National Academies report found conclusive or substantial evidence that cannabis can effectively treat chronic pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea and spasticity. The report, written by an independent panel of medical experts, found no evidence of cannabis overdose deaths. It did, however, find links between cannabis use and an increased risk of vehicle accidents as well as the development of schizophrenia or other psychoses, particularly among the most frequent users. Bachhuber lamented the dearth of research on the best ways to use marijuana as medicine. “We have information that it works based on the National Academies’ report,” he said. “But we don’t know who it works best for, at what dosage, for how long.” Last week, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the nation’s top cop, reiterated his concerns about marijuana and heroin, an illegal opioid. “I am astonished to hear people suggest that we can solve our heroin crisis by legalizing marijuana,” he told law enforcement officers in Virginia, “so people can trade one life-wrecking dependency for another.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2mRVepg Drug and Alcohol Dependence, online February 21, 2017.",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-addiction-medical-marijuana-idUSKBN16Y2HV,Health News,Reuters,health,718

Soccer has been brought to a standstill by the coronavirus crisis with domestic leagues suspended and international competitions such as Euro 2020 and the Copa America postponed. FIFPRO and its affiliated national unions had already received “a large volume of calls for assistance from professional footballers”, the union said on Friday. Although it was encouraged by co-operation at international level, FIFPRO expressed concern that “a significant number of clubs ... have begun to immediately lay off players or unilaterally reduce their salaries”. “We call on clubs with short-term financial difficulties to meet with national player unions to negotiate fair and proportionate arrangements which respect their legal obligations,” FIFPRO added. Only a small minority of soccer players enjoyed luxury lifestyles, the union said. “Most football players outside the world’s biggest leagues are earning at the same level or below average domestic income and would be severely affected by salary decreases,” it added.

2018-11-02 09:00:01,2018,11.0,2,The Week in Tech: Social Media Ugliness Hits Home,"Bits Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Greetings from sunny San Francisco. I’m Nathaniel Popper, a Times reporter covering financial technology and strange things like Bitcoin and the blockchain. I wrote a story this week about a crazy scheme to build a blockchain-based community in the Nevada desert. But I couldn’t help spending much of the week riveted by the work my colleagues were doing. A few years ago, an Apple product introduction, which was covered this week by Jack Nicas, or the quarterly earnings announcements of the big companies, might have been the thing everyone was talking about. And in more ordinary times, the biggest news in Silicon Valley would have been the fallout from the article that my colleagues Daisuke Wakabayashi and Katie Benner published last week about Google and its handling of sexual harassment. Thousands of Google employees walked out of work on Thursday to protest the company’s policies and decision-making. Earlier in the week, one of the executives named in the Times article, Richard DeVaul, resigned. Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said that his initial response and apology had not been forceful enough. He promised to support and work with internal critics. But all of this happened at a time when Silicon Valley was fixated on the role technology might have played in the deadly synagogue shooting last Saturday, not far from where I grew up in Pittsburgh, and the package bombs that were intercepted last week. In the days after those events, Kevin Roose looked at how Cesar Sayoc Jr., the man who was accused of sending the pipe bombs, had fallen into a maelstrom of right-wing conspiracy theories on Facebook and Twitter. These theories appear to have stoked Mr. Sayoc’s anger toward the people, mostly Democratic politicians, who received the pipe bombs. Kevin followed that up by examining the online postings of Robert Bowers, the man accused in the slaughter in Pittsburgh, who had used the fringe online network Gab to voice his hatred of Jews and immigrants. Kevin also hosted two fascinating episodes of The Daily podcast, where he examined the rise of anger-stoking websites and Russian propaganda aimed at creating discord. The big social networks have, of course, been trying to confront the spread of divisive news and misinformation on their platforms. Facebook’s quarterly financial results, which it announced on Tuesday, showed a slowdown in revenue that appears to have been caused, at least in part, by the company’s efforts to rein in bad actors. But a flurry of reports this week underscored how ineffective these measures have been. A Vice reporter, William Turton, found that despite Facebook’s new efforts at advertising transparency, he was able to get approval for ads that he posted in the name of fake political groups and sitting senators. When Twitter unveiled a page dedicated to capturing news on the midterm elections, BuzzFeed quickly noticed that the page was spotlighting disinformation. Even when one social network manages to drive away bad actors, those bad actors are generally able to find other online outlets for their activities. Sheera Frenkel, Mike Isaac and Kate Conger shined a spotlight on how Instagram has become the latest hot spot for anti-Semitic material. A few days after the synagogue shooting, a social network that began as a place to post happy vacation photos was found to be hosting over 11,000 posts with a hashtag that blamed Jews for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Kara Swisher, who has been covering the tech world for decades, wrote a column for The Times this week where she described how the internet, which promised to promote global harmony, has instead become a tool of hate. All in all, it was enough to make at least this reporter long for a time when a new iPad was the thing everything was talking about. Some other tech stories of note this week: ■ Nellie Bowles wrote a powerful trio of stories about our troubled relationship with the screens that dominate our lives. Her first story looked at how many people in Silicon Valley do everything in their power to keep their children away from screens. Some parents have gone so far as to bar the people taking care of their children from ever using a phone or other electronic device in front of the kids. Not long ago, people were worried about poor children missing out on the digital revolution. Now, Nellie reported, there is more concern that poor children are getting too much of the revolution, in the form of screen time, while wealthier parents keep their children away from addictive digital devices. ■ Most Americans have probably not heard of Bytedance, the Chinese company Raymond Zhong profiled this week. But the company has risen into an unlikely Goliath of the internet — with a value of around $75 billion — by serving up lots and lots of fluff. In China, the company has a bunch of different applications that allow young users to share everything from news to their latest break-dancing moves. Outside China, the company’s video platform, TikTok, has gained popularity as a place to broadcast short, personal videos. ■ Thomas Fuller and Cade Metz explained that scientists are getting better at understanding earthquakes and potentially providing early warnings, thanks to artificial intelligence. Earthquake predictions have been notoriously bad, but some people in the field said their experiments had been helped by the kind of neural networks that are used to program talking digital assistants and driverless cars.

2020-02-01 00:00:00,2020,2.0,1,Expats across China flee as virus fears mount,"SHANGHAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Expatriates are leaving coronavirus-hit China - and not just from the outbreak epicentre in Wuhan - as worries about their children take hold and private health care facilities start turning away the feverish. Some foreigners also fear being trapped indefinitely as airlines cancel flights and countries quarantine or limit entry for people who have recently set foot in the country, according to interviews with eight people who are or were based in four Chinese cities. A growing number of governments are urging their citizens not to travel to China and the United Kingdom said on Saturday its embassy and consulates in the country will maintain only a skeleton staff. “It may be increasingly difficult for those who wish to leave China to do so, and there is a growing risk of UK nationals being unable to access medical care as hospitals become overwhelmed,” the British embassy said on Saturday. The virus, declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday, has killed 259 people and spread to some two dozen countries, although the vast majority of those known to be infected are in China. Expat chatgroups are alight with exchanges on the pros and cons of leaving, and tips on visas. “Wouldn’t go if we didn’t have kid,” Russian expat Maria Arkhangelskaya, who has a 20-month-old daughter and left Shanghai for Thailand on Thursday, said via WeChat. Meanwhile, many of the costly private clinics catering to foreigners have started to turn people with fevers away, raising concerns among the expat community they would have to rely on local facilities if they needed medical care. “I don’t want to go to the local hospital with a sore throat only to catch something else,” said Czech national Veronika Krubner in Tianjin, who is considering leaving the country with her 21-month-old daughter. Private clinic Raffles in Beijing will take the temperature of patients on entry and suspected virus cases will be referred to public fever clinics, a person answering the appointments hotline said. People manning the appointment lines at private practices Parkway Health and Ferguson in Shanghai said the government had instructed them not to accept patients with a high temperature, and that they should be referred to public fever clinics. Private clinic Jiahui Health said in a January 24 text message to patients in Shanghai that it cannot screen for the virus and those who have a fever of over 37.8 degrees Celsius (100° Fahrenheit) should go to a public facility designated for treating fever patients. Visiting a public hospital in China can mean first waiting in line to get a ticket to see a doctor, only to wait in an another hours-long queue before being seen, and language is a barrier for non-Chinese speakers. Harrowing scenes of panicked crowds in Wuhan hospitals have circulated on social media. One U.S. citizen who is based in Shanghai and asked not to be identified said he flew home to California last week. “I’m not worried so much about the virus as I am about being forced to go to a Chinese hospital simply for having a fever,” he said. Over 900,000 foreigners were living in China last year, according to a January 2019 report in the official China Daily. The WHO has praised China for its response to the outbreak thus far. Many areas of China have extended the Lunar New Year holiday through Feb 9, and companies have curtailed business travel. There is “no business to do in China for at least two weeks,” said Louis-Olivier Roy, a Canadian business-owner based in the southern city of Dongguan who decided on Tuesday to return home temporarily. “I was planning to travel around for work but obviously can’t for a while,” he said. As airlines cancel flights, many expats are trying to get away, afraid of being effectively stranded in the country. The United States, Australia and Singapore have barred entry to foreigners who have recently been in China. “If the problem got severe enough I might not be able to make it back to America,” said another American, who flew home on Jan 24 to avoid the possibility of mass flight cancellations. As anxiety rises, demand for emotional support is soaring. “People are really scared,” said Emanuele Gatti, a counselling psychologist based in the southern city of Shenzhen. After sending out a flyer for an online coronavirus support group for those suffering “severe anxiety and isolation” on Wednesday, he was inundated with requests on Thursday. “I am receiving 1 friendship request per minute,” he said on Thursday. While some turn to online help, others are still trying to decide whether to stay or go. “Everyone is going and I just get messages asking me if I’ve booked my flight yet,” said Han Lili, a British national living in Shanghai.

Like other EU countries, the Czech Republic has shut borders and virtually locked the nation down to try to contain coronavirus contagion.

2020-02-03 00:00:00,2020,2.0,3,"Alphabet discloses YouTube, Cloud revenues for the first time","Google broke out numbers for its YouTube and cloud businesses for the first time in its fourth-quarter 2019 earnings report Monday. But the disclosure was limited in scope, making it difficult to gauge the profitability for those businesses. YouTube ads generated $15.15 billion in revenue in fiscal 2019, with $4.72 billion in the fourth quarter alone. The segment generated $11.16 billion in revenue in 2018, including $3.61 billion in the the fourth quarter of that year. The segment does not include YouTube's nonadvertising revenue, like subscriptions for YouTube TV, which are included in Google's other revenue segment. On a call with analysts, Ruth Porat, the CFO of Google and YouTube's parent company Alphabet, said YouTube's nonadvertising revenue reached a $3 billion revenue run rate in the fourth quarter. She added that the majority of YouTube ad revenue goes to creators, though Google does not break out that number. A Google spokesperson declined to say what percentage of YouTube's advertising revenue goes to its creators, making it difficult to gauge how profitable it actually is, despite impressive growth in gross ad revenue over the last two years.  Google's cloud business generated $8.92 billion in revenue in fiscal 2019, with $2.61 billion generated in the fourth quarter. That compares with 2018 revenue of $5.84 billion for the cloud business, with $1.71 billion generated in the fourth quarter of that year. Shares of Google's parent company Alphabet were down about 3.5% after hours. Analysts have long called for Google to report YouTube's earnings separately, as it is thought to be a substantial part of its advertising business. To put YouTube's revenue in perspective of another media company, it generated more from ads in 2018 than Discovery, which reported annual revenue of $10.6 billion compared to YouTube's $11.16 billion. Discovery has not yet reported its full-year 2019 results. Google's cloud business is a younger but fast-growing segment of the business with ambitions to take on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. In July, Google said its cloud unit had just reached $8 billion in annualized revenue and planned to triple its sales force over the next few years. The move toward greater transparency comes during CEO Sundar Pichai's first earnings report leading Google's parent company, Alphabet. Former Alphabet CEO and Google founder Larry Page stepped down from the position in December, leaving Pichai in charge of the broader business. Page and co-founder Sergey Brin, who simultaneously stepped down as president of Alphabet, still retain controlling voting shares of the company. Google has been under close watch by federal and state regulators searching for any indication of anti-competitive behavior. A coalition of 50 attorneys general from different states and territories have announced their investigation into Google's ad business. The new disclosure gives investors more insights into the different parts of Google's ad segment that investigators might be looking at.

Arm’s newest chip design is called the Cortex-A65AE, expected to hit markets in 2020, and is designed around the idea of being able to handle the stream of data from a self-driving car’s sensors in near real-time, but with new safety features intended to make the chips better suited to cars, where glitches that are minor annoyances in consumer electronics could lead to crashes. Arm is best known a supplier of chip technology to mobile phones. It provides some of the underlying designs and technology for essentially all mobile phone processor chips, including both Apple Inc’s iPhones and Android devices powered Qualcomm Inc’s chips. In September, Arm introduced its first automotive-oriented chip, the Cortex-A76AE. That chip was the first from Arm with a new safety feature called “Split Lock.” The idea is that when car designers want the chip to work its fastest, they can split up the processing “cores” on the chip and process data in multiple cores at once. But when designers want to maximize safety, they can “lock” cores together to perform the same operations simultaneously and double check the chip’s work, minimizing the chance of computing errors. The chip released Tuesday has the new safety features, as well as features designed to help it process and pass along data from sensors quickly. It also has pathway for speedy connection to graphics processors such as those supplied by Nvidia Corp, which are being adopted by car makers and which Arm’s chips would serve as a complement to. But Arm’s chips would compete directly against those supplied by Intel’s Mobileye self-driving car unit. One of Arm’s core competitive advantages is that, after years of developing chips for mobile phones with tiny batteries, its chips focus on consuming less power. “Some of the autonomous systems you see, they’ve force-fitted data center equipment into the trunk of a car,” Lakshmi Mandyam, vice president of Arm’s automotive business, said in an interview. “Industry believes that, from a power perspective, that needs to come down 10 times from where we are. They see Arm as being a centerpiece of that.” Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Lisa Shumaker",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-arm-holdings/arm-holdings-unveils-chip-aimed-at-self-driving-car-sensors-idUSKBN1OH1GV,Technology News,Reuters,technology,412
2017-11-08 15:27:00,2017,11.0,8,Nearly Half of People With Depression Also Have Anxiety,"Writing in a 1977 clinical handbook on depression, the Harvard psychiatrist Gerald Klerman said the relationship between anxiety and depression has ""long been the subject of controversy among clinicians."" He pointed out that the terms anxiety and depression have multiple definitions, and their overlapping symptoms and treatment protocols often lead to confusion. Forty years have passed since then. But when you speak with mental health researchers today, you still hear a lot of the same talk: ""When it comes to anxiety and depression, you see a lot of related or overlapping symptoms, and as a result, the diagnoses the same patient receives across a number of providers can be inconsistent,"" says Christina Chick, a postdoctoral research fellow at Stanford University. But while someone with depression and someone with anxiety may have corresponding symptoms, Chick says it's also possible that two people diagnosed with anxiety won't have overlapping symptoms. Confused yet? Hashing out some definitions of these two conditions might help—although nailing those down is also tricky. ""Are we talking about the mood states, or the disorders?"" asks Michelle Newman, director of Penn State University's Laboratory for Anxiety and Mood Pathology. Newman explains that a ""mood state"" could be run-of-the-mill anxiety or depression—the worrying or sadness we all feel from time to time—while disorders are persistent conditions that include clusters of symptoms and potential comorbidities. Making matters even more complicated: Both anxiety and depression can be broken down into subcategories—each with its own set of symptoms and diagnostic criteria. But in broad terms, anxiety is worry or nervousness or a feeling of unease—usually about some future threat or event—that makes you feel ""keyed up or on edge,"" Newman says. This physical component is a big part of it, she adds. Anxiety could manifest as a racing heart or muscle tension—some sign that the agitation you're experiencing is escaping the boundaries of your brain and affecting your body. Chick adds to that definition. ""It's a hypervigilance about things that could go wrong, to the point that you have difficulty applying your cognitive facilities to other pursuits,"" she says. Depression, meanwhile, is more about mood. ""It's the persistent presence of sadness or melancholy,"" Chick explains. ""Or it could also be an absence of feeling, or the loss of pleasure or interest in activities a person has typically found engaging or rewarding."" Or all of these things. More From Tonic: ""If you're sitting with someone who has depressed mood, it feels very different than sitting with someone with anxiety,"" Newman says. ""Depression looks and feels like hopelessness—like the person knows for sure the worst is going to happen, so they might as well not try—while anxiety feels like the person is holding out hope even though they fear the worst."" An anxious persons also tends to seem agitated, she says, while someone who's depressed is more likely to be listless. As far as their symptoms go, ""picture a Venn diagram,"" Chick says. ""Each disorder has some distinct symptoms and some overlap."" Insomnia, problems focusing or concentrating, and feeling edgy or restless are among the diagnostic criteria for both generalized anxiety disorder and clinical depression, according to the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. To be diagnosed with major depression, your qualifying symptoms need to stick around for at least two weeks, per the DSM. For a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, six months is the diagnostic bar you're hoping not to hurdle. ""There's also a lot of overlap when it comes to treatments,"" Chick says. ""For example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors""—a.k.a., SSRIs—""help increase the bioavailable amount of serotonin circulating in body, and that helps you feel calm."" It's easy to see how an increased feeling of calm might help alleviate symptoms of both anxiety and depression, she adds. Symptoms and treatments aside, the fact that many people experience both of these disorders—often back to back—is one of the big reasons they tend to be grouped together. Studies vary, but most find 40 to 50 percent of people who experience one experience the other, Newman says. For a long time, it was thought that feelings of anxiety might grease the slide into depression. Newman's own research has shown that, in many cases, this is true. But she says her team's work has also ""sort of busted that myth."" ""If you look at both [disorders] across time, they equally predict one another,"" she says. ""Anxiety is not more likely to precede depression [than vice versa]."" What really binds them together, Newman says, is that these are both disorders of ""negative affect,"" or negative emotions and outlook. ""That makes them unique from other mental health problems, and that's why they're often lumped together,"" she says. Examined this way, it's easier to see why anxiety and depression go hand in hand, and treatment options—form drugs to cognitive behavioral therapy—are often similar, if not the same. Chick puts a finer point on things. ""These are mood disorders we all experience to some degree,"" she says, ""and I think there are ways in which a person experiences the world that might contribute to a risk for both.""

2016-06-09 00:00:00,2016,6.0,9,Founding family considers increasing stake in Ubisoft: Le Monde,"PARIS (Reuters) - The Guillemot family is considering increasing its stake in French video games maker Ubisoft, using proceeds of the sale of its shares in Gameloft to fend off Vivendi, Ubisoft Chief Executive Officer Yves Guillemot told daily Le Monde in an interview published on Thursday. The Guillemot family said on Tuesday it will reluctantly sell its Gameloft stake to Vivendi, following an unsolicited bid from the media giant. Asked whether the family would use the proceeds to strengthen its position in Ubisoft, Yves Guillemot said: “This is something that we’re discussing with my brothers.” Vivendi is Ubisoft’s biggest shareholder, controlling 18 percent of its capital, while the Guillemots own about 9 percent of the shares, according to Reuters data. Vivendi, led by billionaire Vincent Bollore, said it was seeking a suitable level of board representation at Ubisoft, owner of the “Raving Rabbids” and “Assassin’s Creed” franchises. “We don’t want them sitting on the board, because they’re implementing a creeping control strategy to take over the company,” Yves Guillemot told Le Monde. A spokesperson for Vivendi declined comment on Guillemot’s comments.

2017-01-27 12:05:37,2017,1.0,27,Nursing Home Residents Gain New Protections,"The New Old Age If you had to give the nation’s nursing homes a letter grade for quality, what would it be? Experts tend to sigh at this question and point out, correctly, that the country’s 15,600 facilities are vastly different — rural and urban, for-profit and nonprofit and government-run, home to the reasonably healthy and the extremely sick, high-quality operations and appalling ones. Assigning grades can be folly. But when prodded, they come up with decidedly middling assessments. Dr. Cheryl Phillips, head of public policy for LeadingAge, which represents 2,200 nonprofit nursing homes: C-minus. Nicholas Castle, a health policy researcher at the University of Pittsburgh: B-minus. Robyn Grant, public policy director at the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, a leading advocacy group: No grade. “Far too many have a long way to go to give residents the quality of care and quality of life they deserve.” I asked because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services last fall issued a broad revision of nursing home regulations; the first batch took effect in late November, with the rest to be phased in this year and in 2019. “These are the first comprehensive updates to long-term care requirements since 1991,” said Dr. Kate Goodrich, the centers’ chief medical officer. They emerged from a four-year process involving many meetings and almost 10,000 comments from interested parties. Will the new requirements help improve care for the country’s 1.4 million nursing home residents — perhaps raise the report card grade to a solid B? “From our perspective, it’s a mixed bag,” Ms. Grant said. Residents and families will most likely appreciate some of these changes once they are in place. But the regulations disappointed nursing associations and many advocates by declining to set minimum staffing standards. And one key provision has already been stopped in its tracks by a lawsuit. A look at some particulars: ■ The regulations strengthen residents’ control over certain decisions important to their daily lives. For example, the rules allow people to receive any visitor they choose (not just relatives) whenever they choose, without restricted hours, as long as visitors don’t disturb other residents. Just having family members around in the evening, when homes have fewer staff members, might improve attention and care, Dr. Castle pointed out. The requirements also allow residents to choose their roommates when both parties agree, making it easier for friends, siblings or same-sex couples to share living quarters. And they require facilities to make meals and snacks available when residents want to eat, not only at predetermined mealtimes. “Over all, we are really pleased with the focus on person-centered care, trying to transform the nursing home environment,” Dr. Phillips said. ■ For the first time, nursing homes must take “reasonable care” of residents’ personal belongings and can’t shrug off responsibility for theft or loss by requiring residents to sign waivers. “That’s been a big complaint,” Ms. Grant said. Moving into a nursing home already requires giving up so many possessions that “losing something can be devastating” — especially when eyeglasses, hearing aids or dentures go missing. ■ The regulations call for expanded staff training in preventing elder abuse and in caring for patients with dementia. Dr. Phillips calls the latter critically important; most residents have moderate or severe dementia, Medicare statistics show. The rule also requires a nursing home to designate an infection-control officer and to establish a system to monitor antibiotic use. ■ Long-term-care ombudsmen report frequent complaints of “dumping”: A nursing home sends a resident, often someone whose dementia causes problematic behavior, to a hospital. Then, after she is discharged, the home won’t readmit her. “Once they’re out the door, it’s a lot easier to just evict someone,” Ms. Grant said. The existing regulations provide a lot of protection against being bounced from nursing homes; the new rule extends those protections to someone who’s been hospitalized but intends to return. “That resident has all the rights that go with discharge and can appeal the decision.” Nor can the facility transfer the resident while she is appealing. The rule toughens other kinds of grievance procedures as well. But one major change, a ban on the binding arbitration agreements that nursing homes frequently require at admission — before any dispute arises — has already stalled. The American Health Care Association, which represents most for-profit nursing homes — 70 percent of nursing homes in the United States are for-profit — filed suit to stop the change. In November, a federal court in Mississippi granted a preliminary injunction. Giving residents and families the right to take nursing homes to court could bring far-reaching results, Ms. Grant said. Arbitration proceedings typically remain confidential, and monetary awards can be modest. “It’s all behind closed doors,” she said. “When you have a public lawsuit, that’s an amount of money that gets attention from owners and operators and serves as a deterrent” to substandard care. Medicare has appealed, but a final court disposition could be months or years away. “This may be one area where C.M.S. says, ‘We tried it and it didn’t work,’” Dr. Phillips said. LeadingAge takes the position that arbitration should be optional but not outlawed. The government also declined to incorporate specific staff ratios or minimum hours of care in the new regulations, or to require nursing homes to have registered nurses on site around the clock. (Current rules require R.N.s only for eight hours.) Instead, homes must develop assessments of their resources and residents’ needs and hire accordingly. Federal regulators feared that some homes, particularly in rural areas, might find higher staff requirements unnecessary and impossible to reach, and close down rather than face violations and fines. Advocates are fuming, however, because better staffing has been shown to improve quality of care. Without standards, “it’s completely left to the nursing homes, and they’re not going to change because there’s no incentive to,” said Charlene Harrington, a longtime nursing home researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. “They can cut staff, keep their wages low and pocket the profits,” she said. As with any regulation, much depends on implementation and enforcement. Medicare will not issue guidance — the details on exactly how nursing homes must comply — until summer. And some obvious upgrades lie beyond the scope of such rules, Dr. Castle pointed out. Paying nursing aides more helps to reduce staff turnover, he said, as does “consistent assignment” — having aides care for and develop relationships with the same patients each day. “If you really want to improve nursing homes, you should pay more for Medicaid,” Dr. Castle added. The federal and state program underwrites most long-stay nursing home care, and it is chronically underfunded. “What do you do with $98 a day to care for a resident?” But Washington doesn’t seem to be in a let’s-pay-more mood. In fact, “we’re wondering and worrying whether these new regulations will be repealed” by the Republican Congress, Ms. Grant said. For now, though, they are the law. Families and residents who want to know more can wade through hundreds of pages in the Federal Register (I don’t recommend it) or turn to summaries compiled by consumer groups. Better yet, they can contact local or state long-term-care ombudsmen to learn how the changes apply to them.

2016-09-30 18:37:00,2016,9.0,30,What It's Like to Use VR to Buy Multimillion Dollar Real Estate,"To own a home in Manhattan, you essentially need to be a millionaire. New York's total property value soared earlier this year, reaching a record-setting value of around $1 trillion. The median sales price of a Manhattan home was $2 million, and that's not even at the top. To make it easier for wealthy people to see their options without the legwork, a virtual reality company is applying Oculus Rift technology to real estate. With Virtual Xperience, a startup founded by Jeff Maurer and Stephanie Davis, you can put on a VR headset and take a tour of a potential apartment or building, whether or not it has been built in real life. While Davis and Maurer hope the technology will eventually reach the entire real estate market, it's currently limited to luxury properties. And it could be especially helpful for foreign buyers, who are more likely to invest in luxury properties without stepping foot in them. As part of Luxury Week, Motherboard's dive into how the wealthy live, I took a tour of a $7 million apartment in both virtual and actuality reality. The space that I saw was a five bedroom apartment on Prince Street, in lower Manhattan. On the VR headset I could tell it was ritzy—with high ceilings in the living room, a fireplace and a little lookout balcony on the second floor. There was customized art and detailed fixtures designed by Virtual Xperience around the house, which helped to visualize the possibilities of the apartment. Learning how to maneuver through the VR with controllers was fairly easy, if not intuitive. But the technology is still nowhere as smooth as our regular vision, and the process of turning around in tiny movements gave me significant nausea. When I visited the space in real life, I was hit with a different sensation: the fear of climbing through construction site scaffolding in heels. At the actual site on Prince Street it was much harder to imagine what the apartment would look like, since there were no walls, stairs or details. The main benefit was that I got a better sense of the neighborhood, and the size of the space. As VR continues to ease into different parts of our life, I can see why it would be an asset in the real estate market, where it's otherwise easy to get misled by sneaky angles of tiny rooms online. And it might make it easier to flip through multiple properties, as long as you've got your VR sea legs. But it won't completely replace seeing a place in real life, unless you're a buyer just looking to accumulate property instead of making it a home.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pgkxx8/what-its-like-to-use-vr-to-buy-multimillion-dollar-real-estate,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,446
2019-12-12 00:00:00,2019,12.0,12,You can now hear Samuel L. Jackson’s voice on your Amazon Echo,"Similar to what Google Assistant has done, Amazon is now giving customers the option to hear some familiar voices in addition to Alexa’s default voice. Today the company kicked off its celebrity voice program, and it’s starting with Samuel L. Jackson. Amazon announced in September that this was coming, and as of today you can pay $0.99 and have Jackson respond to your Alexa requests for music, the weather forecast, and more. You can also ask questions that are specific to Jackson, including queries about his career, specific roles, or his interests outside Hollywood. To enable this feature, you can say “Alexa, introduce me to Samuel L. Jackson” or purchase the required Alexa skill manually. Jackson doesn’t replace Alexa’s main voice, you’ve got to specifically request the voice by saying “Alexa, ask Samuel L. Jackson,” followed by your question. Instead of relying entirely on prerecorded phrases, the Samuel L. Jackson voice is powered in part by Amazon’s neural text-to-speech model. It’s like a lightweight deepfake, but the actor obviously gave his permission to stand in for Alexa’s standard voice. He also recorded plenty of audio for Amazon to base everything on. You’ll hear the neural responses if you ask for the weather, as one example, but other responses are definitely canned. Since you might have a range of ages in your house, Amazon offers both explicit and clean versions of Samuel L. Jackson’s celebrity voice. The profanity-laced option will feel more true to the actor’s on-screen work, but if you want to tone it down, you can do so in the Alexa app settings menu. Amazon has said that celebrity voices will cost $4.99 after an introductory discount. The feature doesn’t yet support lists, reminders, skills, or shopping for Amazon items through Alexa. But everything else should work fine; just keep in mind that English is the only language on offer right now. Correction 3:00PM ET December 12th: The article has been updated to note that Samuel L. Jackson’s voice does not replace Alexa’s, but can be requested on demand.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21013145/amazon-echo-alexa-samuel-l-jackson-celebrity-voice-now-available-price,Tech,The Verge,technology,340
2017-09-22 09:00:02,2017,9.0,22,Farhad’s and Mike’s Week in Tech: A Very Bad Week for Digital Giants,"Bits Each Friday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Farhad: Good morning, Mike! How was your week? I’ve been busy trying to get my digital life in order. For instance, I’ve decided to check my email just twice a day, and I’m carrying around my Kindle so that when I get the urge to check Twitter on my phone, I read a book instead. I have high hopes that it will make me fitter, happier and more productive. What do you think? Mike: Um, no wonder it’s taking so long for you to respond to my emails. I’m going to start texting you my email threads instead. Prepare for a lot of chain letters. Farhad: Great. Well, let’s talk tech. First, quickly: Google is spending $1.1 billion to hire about 2,000 employees from HTC, the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer that has run into financial problems. Google and HTC have long been partners — HTC made Google’s Pixel smartphone — so this deal effectively creates a more tightly integrated team for building Google’s hardware. And Google has bet big on hardware lately. On that note: Nest, one of Google’s sister companies, unveiled a set of home security gadgets this week. I wish I had some sparkling insight to offer here to make sense of all this. Why is Google, which has repeatedly failed to make it big in hardware, spending so much to become a big player? But the answer is really straightforward: because it has the money, so why not? We’re at that stage in the tech industry where every one of the five tech giants is doing everything, because their money is endless and their appetites are ferocious. There is not much more to it than that. Mike: I honestly am a bit confused here. Remember the Motorola debacle from a few years back? Google paid more than $12 billion to buy Motorola Mobility, another struggling handset maker, in an attempt to take on Apple more directly and own the hardware stack from top to bottom. That didn’t work out so well. Google ended up selling Motorola for parts after it realized that, uh, no one wanted to buy Motorola phones. Some people are saying this is about gaining more expertise inside Google for building hardware. O.K., I guess. But let’s hope it works out better than last time. Farhad: Let’s turn to Apple, Facebook and Amazon, since they all had a rough week. For Apple, it was about a buggy smartwatch. The new Apple Watch is supposed to work on cellular networks, meaning it can reach the internet even if you’re away from your phone. Our own reviewer, Brian X. Chen, found that it worked quite well, but reviewers at The Wall Street Journal and The Verge discovered a flaw in the devices that prevented them from reaching cellular networks in some instances. Apple said it would fix the bug in a software update, but it’s still an embarrassing slip from a company that prides itself on getting things perfect. Mike: Do we have to call this one “Watchgate?” I swear, every few iPhone launches we see some damning flaw in the hardware, and it takes a little shine off their huge annual product introductions. However, people will still buy their new iPhones in droves, as they always do. Probably the new watch, too. And to be fair to Apple, at least they aren’t shipping phones that explode in your pants pocket. Farhad: Facebook, meanwhile, had to scramble to fix its ad targeting engine after ProPublica found that advertisers could use the system to target ads using racial slurs—for instance, people could show ads to “Jew haters.” Other reporters soon found that Google’s and Twitter’s ad systems could also be used to target heinous categories. Coming on top of reports that Russia used Facebook’s ad system to manipulate the American election, the stories fed the perception that these companies just don’t know how their systems are being used. Mike: And don’t forget that Facebook finally came out with a nine-point list on how the company plans to comply with continuing investigations into Russian-linked ads and even begin some forms of self-regulation for political ads on Facebook. It’s a huge story. Farhad: Oh, for further evidence of the cluelessness of tech companies over their platforms, Amazon’s website has been recommending bomb-making materials to people, a British report found. Boy oh boy. Remember when tech was fun and zany, when it was all about getting cool gadgets? We’re long past that. Mike: I started playing a video game the other day that’s basically Grand Theft Auto meets San Francisco hackers. Part of the game includes making guns from a 3-D printer. The future is terrifying. Farhad: The rapidly deteriorating image of tech companies is having real-world consequences. Our colleague Cecilia Kang reported that Facebook and Google have lost so much clout in Washington that they’ve all but given up trying to stop a sex-trafficking bill that they think could have negative consequences for their businesses. The bill would allow people to sue some websites for the content they host — a huge change to existing law, which doesn’t hold companies responsible for stuff their users post on their sites, as long as they work to take down illegal material. Internet giants were gearing up to fight the law, but they’ve determined that the growing anti-tech sentiment makes it too difficult. It’s hard out there for a tech giant — other than all those billions of dollars they keep raking in. Mike: Right, and I think tech companies have grown wise to where the tide is turning. Right now, we’re seeing Facebook try to get ahead of Congress by announcing that it wants to essentially regulate its own political ads, largely because it doesn’t want Congress to intervene. Also, I can only imagine that Google, Twitter and Amazon are bracing for the possibility of this story picking apart their businesses, too. In any case, the future is scary! Should we trust these tech companies that say they’ve got it covered, and have our best interests in hand? Farhad: Um … probably not? O.K., see ya. Mike: Ta ta for now!",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/technology/farhads-and-mikes-week-in-tech-a-very-bad-week-for-digital-giants.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,1055

2016-10-24 00:00:00,2016,10.0,24,This AI program sees genitals everywhere it looks,"Google's Deep Dream software proved that computer imagination can be strange and hallucinogenic. But, given the right parameters, it can also be profoundly dirty. Just look at the AI-generated pictures above — the top row of images all look fairly innocent (they're supposed to be towers); but the bottom row, well, has an unmistakeable penis-y feel to it. That's right: artificial intelligence has learned how to hallucinate genitals. This imagery is the work of computer scientist Gabriel Goh, who created a neural network that mashes together two existing programs. The first is a Deep Dream-like image generator from MIT that uses deep learning to look at libraries of pictures and create similar images, and the second is an open-source program from Yahoo that automatically detects and filters pornography. Goh essentially plugged these two neural nets together, creating a program that can generate random images with an adjustable amount of NSFW-ness. The neural net scores images between 0 and 1, with 0 being completely safe-for-work and 1 being definitely pornographic. (For a full description check out Goh's GitHub page.) Here's what a low score looks like:  And here's a high score:  The most interesting application of Goh's work is when he uses his program to generate NSFW imagery based on scenes already identified by MIT's neural net. Goh asks his program to create pictures of known imagery — like beaches, concerts, canyons, etc. — but then ramps up the NSFW factor so the network exaggerates the patterns shapes and colors that could be mistaken for male or female genitalia. This means in an art gallery and during a concert we get lots of pictures of dicks:   While desert scenery seems to skew more towards female genitalia:  And when we take a trip to the beach, we get a mixture of both!  As Goh writes: ""The images generated range from the garishly explicit to the subtle. But the subtle images are the most fascinating as to my surprise they are only seemingly innocent [...] The NSFW elements are all present, just hidden in plain sight."" Indeed, a lot of these images look like the work of a surrealist painter trying to hide as a many penis and labia-like shapes in their landscapes as possible. It also, though, shows the frailties of many deep learning systems. After all, these computers don't know what constitutes NSFW imagery in the same way a human does — they've just been taught to look for certain patterns by absorbing vast amounts of pornographic (and non-pornographic) imagery. Running these processes backwards shows just how skin-deep this knowledge is.",https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/24/13379208/ai-nsfw-neural-nets-deep-dream-genitals,Tech,The Verge,technology,430
2018-02-07 10:38:00,2018,2.0,7,12-Year-Old Alabama Boy Taken Off Life Support After Flu Diagnosis,"On Sunday, an Alabama family said their final goodbyes to their 12-year-old son who was put on life support after being diagnosed with the flu, according to reports. Aaron Masterson, of Huntsville, was taken off of life support after a short battle with the flu, WAFF reports. Aaron was born with cystic fibrosis, a rare, genetic disorder that damages the lungs and digestive system, which amplified the effects of the influenza virus. “Aaron is unique in that he’s had a life-long illness that has suppressed his immune system, which complicated the flu when it came into his body,” friend of the family, Rev. John Mullaney, told WAFF. “Aaron was Aaron. He wasn’t going to stop being who he was because of any limitations that were put on him by his health.” Few details about Aaron’s final days have been made public, but a spokesperson for the Madison County Coroner’s office confirms to PEOPLE that Masterson was “very sick” and died from the flu. In the days following Aaron’s death, the tight-knit community has rallied around the grieving Masterson family, with many sharing memories about the boy. “We constantly are already going back and forth between tears.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently lists the 2017 to 2018 flu season as “moderately severe,” and warns it could get worse. The Centers For Disease Control (CDC) reports that the flu vaccine lessens the chance that someone catches the virus by 10 to 60 percent and doesn’t guarantee that someone will not catch the flu. However, the annual vaccine is highly recommended by the CDC for everyone 6 months and older and the more people that get vaccinated can limit the disease’s spread throughout the community. Although mild illness does not usually require medical attention, the CDC recommends that people experiencing “emergency warning signs” of the flu go to a local emergency room. The CDC recommends ER visits for children having breathing troubles, not eating, children who are not interacting, are irritable, show no tears when crying, have a rash and fever, and have “significantly fewer wet diapers than normal.”",https://people.com/health/12-year-old-alabama-boy-taken-off-life-support-after-deadly-flu-diagnosis-we-miss-you/,health,People,health,489

2017-06-10 12:10:00,2017,6.0,10,An Artist Built an Exact Replica of Artificial Intelligence's Birthplace,"In an office at Carnegie Mellon University, relics from the founding fathers of artificial intelligence aren't rotting away or collecting dust. Instead, they're put on show as part of an installation that takes the lifework of original AI scientists Allen Newell and Herbert Simon and brings it to life within the very technology they dedicated their lives to creating. ""This is kind of like a history room,"" says artist Daniel Pillis, who spent three years researching and creating the installation. Pillis's interest in the history of robotics and artificial intelligence began to really take off when he started graduate school at Carnegie Mellon University in 2012. He's now a visiting researcher and artist-in-residence at Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute. The installation is based of Newell and Simon's original office space, which Pillis replicated through physical archives and oral accounts of the room from former Carnegie Mellon employees. The recreation features minute details about the way the scientists worked from the 1950s through the 1980s as they created the building blocks for artificial intelligence technology, featuring things such as Simon's standing desk workspace with actual chairs he used and messy piles of papers, which Newell was known to keep around his work station. Pillis also included a mold of Simon's hand, which was originally made in the 1990s. Pillis also designed an interactive application that has the entirety of Simon and Newell's archives in a 3D space, which visitors can search through, experiencing the scientists' research first hand through the digital archive. The archives, which Pillis discovered in the university's library, range from work they did in the office which was the basis of artificial intelligence all the way to drawings of dinosaurs that Simon, a future Nobel Laureate (1978, Economic Sciences), drew in grade school in the 1920s. There's also an augmented reality interface where visitors can use the workstations through iPad simulations when they're in the office. ""They invented thinking machines and I tried to make these machines that had their thoughts in them in the way that people could basically embody them—to go into their space and go into their thinking was the goal of the installation,"" Pillis says. ""I was trying to think of a way to basically talk about human identity and consciousness as an object-situated experience, which comes from a lot of their theories about the human mind and the idea of a thinking machine."" Pillis even included an audio file of Apple Talk reading aloud writings from their research. ""It was a way for them to come out of their machine,"" he says. ""The idea of knowledge and technology is that it de-centers identity. When you sit at a computer, you're given the possibility to do anything that the computer can do, so when you have the technology of the computers they used and you have new people standing at them, it's a beautiful breakage in history as a static continuum."" The beauty of the science, Pillis says, is what made creating the installation and researching the lives of Newell and Simon so fascinating. By creating the installation and transferring the scientists' work on to artificial intelligence-based technologies, the artist says Newell and Simon's work has come full-circle. ""They became their machines and they became their information,"" Pillis says. ""As much as they were humans, they were humans who were very invested in making a machine human-like. People were able to interact with them in a way that I thought was intimate through the technology and the information that (Newell and Simon) created."" See more of the works below. Pillis' installation is now closed, but you can still visit a virtually interactive experience of Newell and SImon's office space online here.

2019-09-02 00:00:00,2019,9.0,2,Fewer cardiovascular events seen in diabetics after weight-loss surgery,"(Reuters Health) - For obese diabetics in a large U.S. study, weight-loss surgery was linked with a significant reduction in long-term rates of major cardiovascular problems. The study doesn’t prove that surgery caused the better outcomes. But researchers found that obese individuals with type 2 diabetes who had weight-loss surgery were roughly 35% less likely to experience problems like heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure, and they were less likely to die during the study. They also lost more weight, controlled their diabetes better, and reduced the amount of medication they took. Researchers at the Cleveland Clinic compared 2,287 adults with type 2 diabetes who underwent various types of so-called bariatric surgery and 11,435 similar adults who did not have surgery. Half of the study participants were tracked for at least four years. Everyone in the study had a body mass index above 30, and most had a BMI above 40. They also were taking at least one medication for diabetes or had a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 6.5% or more, indicating poor control of their blood sugar levels. Eight years after the study began, a first-time major cardiovascular event had occurred in 31% of people who had surgery and in 48% of those who didn’t. These events included unstable angina, heart attacks, heart stenting or heart surgery, strokes, procedures on the carotid artery in the neck, an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, heart failure, kidney disease, and death from any cause. Patients who had surgery lost an average of about 64 pounds; control group patients lost about 19 pounds, on average. Average HbA1c levels were 1.1% lower in the surgery group than in the control group by the end of the study, by which time surgery patients also were taking fewer diabetes and heart medications. Diabetics are two to four times more likely to die from heart disease than people without diabetes, the researchers note in a report published in the Journal of the American Medical Association to coincide with a presentation Monday at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in Paris. Weight loss surgery is known to reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The new study “demonstrated weight-loss surgery can significantly reduce the risk of (actual cardiovascular events) in patients with obesity and diabetes,” Dr. Ali Aminian, a bariatric surgeon at Cleveland Clinic who led the study, told Reuters Health by phone. Aminian believes that for diabetic patients with obesity, bariatric surgery should be recommended as early as possible. “It shouldn’t be seen as a last resort,” he said. Still, Aminian and colleagues point out, an observational study such as this one can’t prove cause and effect. Other factors, aside from the surgery, might explain the results. The study’s limitations were also cited by endocrinologist Dr. Jeffrey Mechanick, who was not involved in the research. “The study is retrospective, not prospective,” said Mechanick, who is medical director of the Marie-Josee and Henry R. Kravis Center for Cardiovascular Health at Mount Sinai Heart and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “The reason we need a prospective study is because doctors would not normally suggest surgery for low-risk patients.” Further, he said in a phone interview, the study doesn’t say whether the non-surgical group received the most appropriate and aggressive medical therapy. And while the research shows benefit from surgery, it doesn’t show the lifelong durability or safety of the procedure. The authors too say the effectiveness of weight-loss surgery for patients with diabetes and obesity needs confirmation in randomized trials. The study was sponsored by Medtronic, which manufactures bariatric surgery equipment. Aminian and several coauthors have received grants from the company.

2017-04-26 15:00:00,2017,4.0,26,Black Market Weed Is Growing Where Medical Marijuana Is Legal," As states slowly start to legalize medical marijuana, a question that has remained unanswered is whether more access means more recreational use, too. A new study out today in JAMA Psychiatry says it does. There are 29 states along with Washington, DC that now have medical marijuana laws on the books. And while a few studies have tried to determine how these laws affect illegal marijuana use, this new study is the first to use data collected prior to any medical marijuana laws to track changes in illegal use rates. The researchers, led by Deborah Hasin, a Professor of Epidemiology at Columbia University, looked at data collected in three national surveys on alcohol and drug use from 1991 to 2013. Between the first and third surveys, the researchers found that illegal marijuana use increased more in the states that passed the laws compared to those that didn't.  In states with medical marijuana laws, illegal marijuana use increased by 3.6 percent compared to a 2.2 percent increase in states without medical marijuana. Cannabis use disorders, as defined by the DSM IV, the American Psychiatric Association's mental disorder manual, increased by 1.6 percent and 1.0 percent in states with and without medical marijuana laws, respectively. Read More: United States of Weed The authors believe these findings point to a potential health hazard. ""Medical marijuana laws may benefit some with medical problems. However, changing state laws—medical or recreational—may also have adverse public health consequences, including cannabis use disorders,"" Hasin said in a statement., But the authors of the study also note several limitations. The surveys were self-reported and they admit that more people might have been willing to report their own drug use as it became more socially acceptable. It should also be noted that requirements for a cannabis use disorder—a condition far less dangerous and prevalent than other kinds of drug and alcohol abuse—have changed since the three surveys were conducted. In the DSM IV, cannabis abuse and dependence were separate disorders and neither withdrawal nor craving were criteria for a dependence diagnosis. In the latest version, abuse and dependence have been merged and withdrawal and craving added to the criteria list, changing who might fit the bill for having a disorder. The DSM IV also required one of four criteria to be met for a cannabis abuse disorder diagnosis, one of which was substance-related legal problems, a criterion that has been removed in the latest version. Those surveyed who were diagnosed with a cannabis use disorder may have received a different diagnosis under the new standards. ""Future studies are needed to investigate mechanisms by which increased cannabis use is associated with medical marijuana laws, including increased perceived safety, availability, and generally permissive attitudes,"" said Hasin.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/aemyzg/black-market-weed-is-growing-where-medical-marijuana-is-legal,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,454
2016-10-06 00:00:00,2016,10.0,6,This is what emotions look like in your brain," (CNN)When you think you're letting your mind wander for a few minutes, your brain is actually lighting up with a range of emotions, according to a new study.  Researchers at Duke University's Center for Cognitive Neuroscience asked study participants to rest and think about nothing in particular while inside a scanner, like patients would for an MRI. They observed the peaks and dips of spontaneous emotions passing through the brain like clouds.  ""When people are letting their minds wander is when certain affective states can creep in, and it's a time when we can ruminate on prior stressors or we can get anxious about future events,"" said Kevin LaBar, study co-author and head of the university's neuroscience program.   ""We just had no way of tracking that phenomenon. Part of our interest was that a lot of our emotional life happens when our mind is not focused on a task and is just idling, yet we don't have a good traction on what are those emotions and how long they last."" The research came about because assessing the emotional status of a patient in a clinical setting relies on self-reporting as the gold standard, LaBar said. But in certain cases, people are socialized not to reveal how they feel, such as male war veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, he said.  ""We tend to just ask people how they feel and take that at face value. I think that both for treatment of clinical disorders as well as just basic research, we wanted to try to see whether we come up with more objective ways of measuring emotions. In other cases, like in autism, the social communication problems prevent us from really understanding what their emotional life is like."" The researchers used biomarkers determined by previous studies to observe a dominant range of emotions from positive to negative: content, amusement, surprise, fear, anger, sadness and neutral. The previous studies relied on inducing emotions using film or music clips.  LaBar noted that more nuanced emotions like jealousy are harder to induce or study.  The first emotion the researchers encountered with the majority of participants entering the scanner was fear, even among those who didn't report feeling claustrophobic. This typically lasted for 20 to 30 seconds before transitioning to another emotion.  Neutral states occurred the most often, followed by surprise and amusement, according to the study. Feelings of sadness, fear and anger happened less often, with contentment as the least observed emotion. The researchers also noted that the state of fear decreased over time spent in the scanner, giving way to an increasing trend of neutral states.  But the prevalence in certain biomarkers and emotion patterns also matched up with those who had anxiety or depression or who identified anger as one of their primary personality traits. Those with depression showed more of the sad biomarker, those with anxiety had a larger presence of fear, and as expected, those with the anger trait also showcased the anger biomarker most.  LaBar believes that being able to identify specific associations of emotions with these disorders could be most beneficial when tracking treatment.  ""If we compare the brain scans of people before and after treatment, we can determine whether their resting-state emotions change at the function of that treatment. Somebody who is being treated for depression might feel better or say that they feel better, but if we see that the presence of sadness in their resting state scans is the same or doesn't really change that much, it may suggest that the person may be more vulnerable to relapse following the treatment."" LaBar thinks that this type of scan would be practical and helpful in a clinical setting to evaluate emotions because it relies on observing, rather than inducing. This means that it is also relatively quick, only taking about 10 minutes.  This could also be applied to see whether emotion patterns change in children as they age, used for those with mental disorders such as schizophrenia who claim to feel differently than what they are experiencing, or even used for individuals in a vegetative state to determine whether they are still experiencing emotions within a coma. ""There are some people who really feel that everybody reasons about emotion in a different way and that there shouldn't be any consistency in the emotional life across individuals,"" LaBar said, ""But what this is showing is that with more sophisticated brain-imaging techniques and computing techniques, we can pool some commonalities across the emotional life of people even if they have very different experiences in their life and very different propensity to self-report their emotions.""

The startup is one of 49 “global partners” Saudi Arabia announced for the conference, which is otherwise known as Davos in the Desert. The event starts later this week in the capital city of Riyadh. Walder is a former head of New York City’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and the former CEO of bike-share startup Motivate. He joined Virgin Hyperloop One last November as part of a shake-up in the startup’s leadership, which came after then-chairman Richard Branson criticized the Saudi Arabian government for Khashoggi’s disappearance. Virgin Hyperloop One did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Just a few days after Khashoggi vanished in October 2018, Branson suspended a $1 billion investment into his space company from Saudi Arabia’s public investment fund. He said in a blog post that he “had high hopes for the current government in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,” but that a state-sponsored murder of a journalist “would clearly change the ability of any of us in the West to do business with the Saudi Government.” Virgin Hyperloop One soon backed out of the 2018 Davos in the Desert, alongside dozens of other companies and scheduled speakers. Following that, the Saudi Arabian government officially dropped the $1 billion deal with Virgin Galactic. Branson ultimately stepped down as chairman of Virgin Hyperloop One, and at the same time that Walder came on board, the billionaire mogul’s spot was filled by Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, the CEO of Dubai port operator DP World, which had invested $25 million in the startup. Virgin Hyperloop One raised another $172 million from DP World in May of this year. “We are delighted to be returning to participate at FII this year, along with our investment partners DP World, and we have an amazing display to show guests how our technology will change the way they think about distance and speed,” Walder said in the statement. “We will also be showcasing the results of a recent study conducted in the Kingdom showing the significant economic and job creation opportunities that comes with the deployment of a hyperloop system.”​ ",https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936321/virgin-hyperloop-one-future-investment-davos-desert-jamal-khashoggi,Tech,The Verge,technology,397

According to an LSU press release, Marie is five-foot-one-inch tall and weighs 15 pounds. She also has a detachable head, and a 36-gallon water storage capacity for up to eight hours. Also, Marie is also a lovely shade of purple. (“Purple was on sale,” Moore said in a press release.) Marie is the amalgamation of five full-body scans of women taken at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, per an LSU press release. Then, over the course of 136 hours, LSU’s BigRep industrial 3D printer churned out Marie. But the 3D printer had to produce Marie in four chunks, so Moore used “a combination of soldering, friction stir welding, and sandblasting” to piece her together. To be clear, Marie isn’t a product of bioprinting, or the process of applying 3D printing technology to create biological tissue. Scientists have used this process to transplant artificial organs into rats, and for years, the US Army has been actively looking into making bioprinted hearts, blood vessels, and even skin. In the future, according to Moore, Marie could potentially to create personalized treatments for people with complex forms of cancer. “Children and breast cancer patients have really differing morphology that is usually very difficult to treat,” Moore said in a press release. “I find that the more we learn about any body, the more complex it’s going to be. We’re still getting medicine wrong on a lot of levels. We have a lot to learn.” For the record, Motherboard was not able to confirm whether Marie was named after famed radiation scientist Marie Curie, but the scenario seems likely.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yw7kzv/marie-is-the-first-life-sized-3d-printed-human-body,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,302

TowerJazz (TSEM.O) said on Wednesday it earned 70 cents a share in the last three months of 2015, excluding one-off items, compared with 54 cents in the same period of 2014. Revenue rose 8 percent to a record $254.6 million. The maker of chips for smartphones, battery chargers, AC/DC adapters and image sensors, was expected by analysts to report earnings of 63 cents a share on revenue of $252.4 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S Estimates. Including one-off items, on a GAAP accounting basis, TowerJazz posted a basic EPS of 28 cents versus 1 cent a year ago. “Our GAAP net growth is sustainable and growing,” Chief Executive Russell Ellwanger told Reuters. TowerJazz lost money for years following heavy investments in a second chip plant in Israel, while also paying high interest on its debt. It has since slashed its debt while adding, through acquisitions and joint ventures, plants in Japan, California and San Antonio, Texas. The company predicted it would generate revenue of $276 million in the current quarter, plus or minus 5 percent, equating to year-on-year growth of 22 percent and above analysts’ average forecast of $256.4 million. Ellwanger expects revenue of over $1 billion in 2016. This expected growth is partly attributed to the inclusion of revenue from its San Antonio plant in the beginning of February. TowerJazz acquired the plant from Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM.O), which committed to buy chips from the plant for 15 years. Ellwanger also attributed the growth to being “focused on the right sectors and having the right customers”. TowerJazz had growth of over 25 percent in its main markets - camera sensors, power management and radio frequency (RF) wireless connectivity. “Our product strategy surrounds the trends that drive the Internet of Things,” Ellwanger said. “If you look at how much computing power is in a phone ... you have to have power efficiency, you have to have sensors.” He said about 20 percent of the company’s end products go to the automotive sector as cars become increasingly connected. Its chips, for example, are used in sensors in collision avoidance systems.

In Brazil, Zika has been linked to a spike in cases of microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size and underdeveloped brains. “Until a few months ago, no one had any idea that Zika could cause birth defects,” Frieden told reporters Tuesday at a briefing in Puerto Rico’s health department. Frieden has been working with CDC staff and the Puerto Rican government on strategies to protect pregnant from becoming infected with the mosquito-borne virus, which Frieden called a top priority. In Puerto Rico, the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries Zika is widespread, and Frieden said controlling it will require a multi-pronged approach involving government, municipalities, neighbors, families and society at large. Cases of Zika are doubling weekly in Puerto Rico, and the CDC expects hundreds of thousands of individuals will become infected, including thousands of pregnant women. To protect pregnant women, Frieden recommended using insect repellent daily and reliably. He also suggested adding window screens and air conditioning, where possible. And he called for reducing standing water in and around homes to eliminate mosquito breeding habitats. Frieden’s comments, delivered mostly in Spanish, followed two days of briefings with staff at the CDC’s Emergency Operations Center in San Juan. CDC researchers are monitoring the outbreak and studying the best ways to prevent Zika infections through education campaigns, and the distribution of Zika prevention kits for pregnant women. Much remains unknown about Zika, including whether the virus actually causes microcephaly in babies. Brazil said it has confirmed more than 640 cases of microcephaly, and considers most of them to be related to Zika infections in the mothers. Brazil is investigating more than 4,200 additional suspected cases of microcephaly. At the CDC’s Dengue Branch in Puerto Rico, scientists are conducting research on the most effective mosquito control measures, and processing diagnostic tests from blood samples delivered daily to the laboratory. Dr. Jorge Munoz, branch director, said in an interview they are capable of processing 400 to 500 blood samples a week. Scientists at the laboratory developed a triple test that can detect Zika, dengue and chikungunya - three different viruses carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito that is endemic in Puerto Rico. The test will be crucial in helping to quickly sort out whether Zika was the cause of an infection or whether it was dengue and chikungunya, which also cause infection and illness. “Puerto Rico is in a very different situation from the rest of the United States,” Frieden told the briefing. Besides the high density of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, Puerto Rico has a lot of housing without window screens or air conditioning. “The combination of those two things, when you add Zika in, means the likelihood of a very large number of cases,” Frieden said. “In rest of the United States, we may see clusters,” he said. But if Zika behaves the way chikungunya and dengue have, “we will not see widespread transmission.” (This version of the story deletes reference to FDA emergency use authorization, which was for a different test) Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Bernard Orr",http://www.reuters.com/article/health-zika-frieden-idUSL1N16G2BB,Health News,Reuters,health,557
2018-10-01 00:00:00,2018,10.0,1,Hurricane Florence leads to deadly bacterial infection," (CNN)A North Carolina man died after contracting a bacterial infection while doing yard work related to Hurricane Florence, according to CNN affiliate WECT.  Ron Phelps of Wilmington scraped his leg and it became infected, prompting doctors to amputate it, the station reported. But that wasn't enough to save him.  Phelps' family updated community members on his illness through a Facebook page with nearly 9,000 followers on which he would share photos and memories of the hometown he knew, WECT reported.  His niece ultimately announced his death. ""I sadly need to tell you that Uncle Ronnie quietly passed away this morning. He loved being friends with each and every one of you,"" Paula Phelps Turner posted. North Carolina has recorded 37 deaths related to Hurricane Florence, according to a statement Thursday from Gov. Roy Cooper's office. Most of these were due to vehicles caught in floodwater, but some have been cleanup-related.  At least eight deaths in South Carolina and three in Virginia have also been linked to the storm. ""We have seen some bacterial infections from cuts and scrapes"" among those doing cleanup work, said David Howard, deputy director of public health in New Hanover County, where Wilmington is located. ""It really comes down to bacterial infections that are common in the environment that end up in floodwaters that people are not normally exposed to in a great quantity,"" he said. The New Hanover Regional Medical Center said in an email that it has seen people for bug bites and stings, lacerations and puncture wounds, home oxygen issues, dialysis and stress- and anxiety-related issues. Dr. De Winter, an emergency doctor at the hospital, told WECT, ""We've seen a lot of heat-related illnesses associated with people working outside for long hours, getting tired and then potentially falling off roofs as well."" People with weakened immune systems, such as the elderly, are at particular risk for bacterial infections, Howard said. The health department has administered tetanus vaccinations to some involved in the cleanup efforts, who may also be at increased risk. Authorities have warned residents to stay out of the water to avoid harmful bacteria and other infections. Officials from North and South Carolina have also warned about hazards such as mosquitoes, mold and snakes in the aftermath of the storm, which made landfall September 14 near Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. ""The public continues to swim in the ocean and sounds despite these advisories,"" said Todd Miller, executive director of the North Carolina Coastal Federation. Cooper's office has listed other causes of death related to the hurricane as suicides, drowning, falls and injuries related to cleanup efforts, such as a tree that fell on a man as he was cleaning debris. Two of North Carolina's largest industries, hog farming and coal power generation, are also creating health risks for residents. Overflowing waste pits from hog farms contain bacteria like salmonella and E. coli, while coal ash contains heavy metals such as lead, mercury and arsenic.  Wilma Subra, a chemist and environmental health scientist in Louisiana, previously told CNN that residents should be concerned about contamination in their yards and homes. She cautioned people to use protective gear when cleaning up, as even health threats common in other hurricanes like exposure to sewage could be a problem. ""That's what happened after Katrina. They went back and got boils on their legs"" from exposure to sewage, Subra said.

2020-02-24 00:00:00,2020,2.0,24,"UPDATE 1-Buoyant Turkish tourism wary of slowdown due to Iran, coronavirus worries","(Recasts with hotel association, officials, Turkish Airlines) By Ceyda Caglayan ISTANBUL, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Turkish tourist arrivals surged in January but there are signs of a slowdown in the following months, a hotel association said on Monday, while the closure of Turkey’s border with Iran stoked fears about the impact of the coronavirus. The unease about the spread of the virus in Iran, a key source of tourists for Turkey, was illustrated on Monday as Turkish Airlines canceled flights to four Iranian cities. Tourism is an important source of foreign currency for Turkey, helping to rein in the energy importing country’s usually wide current account deficit, and data on the sector is closely watched. On Monday, Tourism Ministry figures showed the number of foreign visitors arriving in Turkey surged 16.1% year-on-year in January to 1.79 million, with Iranians fourth on the list of countries with 6.7% of the market. The sharp rise in January was in line with the trend last year, when Turkey’s tourism revenues rose 17% to $34.5 billion, but the Hotel Association of Turkey (TUROB) voiced caution about the outlook. “The TUROB assessment showed signs of a slow February and a slowdown in March, despite the rise in the first month of the year,” TUROB said in a statement. It said the hotel occupation rate in January had risen 6.4% from a year earlier to 61.9% but forecast a decline in both this rate and room prices in February and March. On Sunday, Turkey’s health minister said the country had closed its border with Iran and halted incoming flights as a precaution to stop the potential spread of coronavirus. Tehran said 12 people have died and up to 61 have been infected by the virus in Iran. There are usually large numbers of Iranians who visit Turkey in March and April due to Iranian new year in late March, meaning that the length of the border closure could have a major impact on the tourism season, sector officials said. Last year as a whole, some 2.1 million Iranian tourists visited Turkey. Turkey has not recorded any cases of coronavirus but the large spike in Italian cases has especially rattled investors in Europe, concerned about the potential for the virus to spread further and cause economic disruption there. Shares in Turkish Airlines fell 5.6% on Monday, while Pegasus Airlines dropped 4.9%, in line with a slide in airline shares elsewhere over coronavirus worries.

2018-10-29 00:00:00,2018,10.0,29,United States hits Chinese chipmaker Fujian Jinhua with export ban,"New York (CNN Business)The United States is restricting exports to a state-backed Chinese company that makes semiconductors, the latest escalation in Washington's trade fight with Beijing. On Monday, the US Commerce Department said Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Company would not be able to buy components from American companies without a special license. The export ban was put in place because Fujian Jinhua ""poses a significant risk of becoming involved in activities that are contrary to the national security interests of the United States,"" the agency said. ""When a foreign company engages in activity contrary to our national security interests, we will take strong action to protect our national security,"" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement. Ross said the ban will limit the company's ability to ""threaten the supply chain for essential components in our military systems."" The move comes as the United States and China are locked in a standoff over trade, market access and the transfer of technology secrets. It could add strain to an already tense bilateral relationship. Negotiations have reportedly stalled ahead of a planned meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the upcoming G20 summit in Argentina. Earlier this year, the Trump administration put an export ban on ZTE, one of China's biggest tech companies. The agency said that ZTE (ZTCOF) lied to American officials about punishing employees who violated US sanctions against North Korea and Iran. The ban, which became a flashpoint between the two nations, was lifted in July after ZTE paid a $1 billion fine and agreed to oversight measures. The Commerce Department action comes after Micron Technology, a memory chip maker in Idaho, accused Fujian Jinhua of stealing its trade secrets in a federal lawsuit last December. Fujian Jinhua filed a countersuit against Micron in Chinese court in January. Fujian Jinhua, based in East China's Fujian province, was founded in 2016 and has financial backing from the provincial government, according to Chinese state media. It's building a $5.7 billion chip factory in the region. ",https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/29/tech/us-export-ban-fujian-jinhua/index.html,tech,CNN,technology,342

2020-02-06 00:00:00,2020,2.0,6,Greece reports first case of African swine fever,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece detected its first case of African swine fever at a breeding farm in the north of the country this week, agriculture ministry officials said on Thursday. African swine fever is harmless to humans but it is highly contagious and deadly in pigs. It has spread from Africa to Europe and Asia and has already killed hundreds of millions of pigs, affecting global meat markets. The infected pig was found in a small farm in Serres, a region of northern Greece close to the border with Bulgaria and North Macedonia, the ministry said, adding that the trade of pork meat from the area had been banned. It was the first case of African swine fever recorded in Greece, agriculture ministry officials said. Agriculture Minister Makis Voridis told reporters that the government had taken a series of measures to contain it. All farmed pigs and hogs in an area of 3 kilometres (1.86 miles) from the farm were culled. Animals were not allowed to enter or exit areas within a 10 kilometre radius, while tests were being conducted to trace the origin of the disease. “Unfortunately, it appeared in our country,” Voridis said. “We are on alert, we are on standby, but we are also absolutely ready to act as appropriate to contain the disease from spreading and protect our livestock.” Greece produces about a third of its domestic pork consumption and imports the rest. African swine fever has spread in Eastern Europe in recent years, and the pace at which it has spread has alarmed governments and pig farmers. Last month, Serbia saw an outbreak of the pig disease in wild boars in the east of the country, close to its borders with Bulgaria and Romania. Bulgaria said last month that it would cull tens of thousands of pigs after detecting an outbreak of African swine fever at a farm in the northeast.

2017-01-02 16:35:00,2017,1.0,2,Why China Was Able to Steal a US Drone,"Following a drone clash between China and the United States, it's become even more clear that a set of rules are needed to govern drone behavior. When a Chinese navy ship seized an American drone, the guidelines that already existed under the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES) were not enough to settle the dispute. The two-year-old CUES, which includes agreement from 21 countries in order to manage various kinds of crises, does not apply to underwater drones. ""Such encounters will plausibly increase, especially given on the one hand the proliferation of drones for military use—in both aerial, surface and subsurface dimensions—and on the other hand, the geopolitical context in the region favoring deon use,"" Collin Koh Swee Lean, research fellow with Maritime Security Programme at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University told the South China Morning Post. Though CUES does not currently apply to drones, it can be amended to include drone relations in an appendix, according to Yan Yan, maritime law expert at the National Institute for South China Sea studies. Drones are only part of governing increasingly autonomous weapons and other military systems that aren't directly powered by humans. While drones are directed by an actual person, other autonomous or semi-autonomous weapon systems like the Phalanx, used on American navy ships to target incoming missiles, need some form of governance to manage their independent actions. Even drones, like the American one seized by the Chinese ship, are used in a low-intensity military mission for surveillance. However, it's not unlikely that in the near future, armed drones will come to be more commonplace in this region, according to Koh. So as drones, not to mention armed drones, become more commonplace, while the US moves to use autonomous robots underwater and China builds a great underwater wall of robots, using sea drones, international law governing how all these developments engage with each other will need to be ironed out.

2018-08-03 00:00:00,2018,8.0,3,People Are Getting Sick From Tianeptine 'Supplement': Report,"Photo:  Marcio Jose Sanchez (AP)People are increasingly turning to an unconventional drug to supplement their opioid addiction, suggests a new report published this week. And some are getting sick as a result. Since 2014, hundreds of people have apparently rung up their local poison control center in connection to tianeptine, an antidepressant not approved in the U.S. that’s capable of providing an opioid-like high.The report, published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, tracked the frequency of poison control calls related to tianeptine made in the past 17 years. From 2000 to 2014, there were a whopping 11 calls made about the drug. But from 2014 to 2017, there was a total of 207 calls. The majority of calls were made by health care providers concerned about their patients, and most involved people between the ages of 21 to 40.Tianeptine was developed in the 1960s to treat depression. But it interacts with the brain differently than most antidepressants do. Doctors have suspected for decades that people can become addicted to tianeptine, but weren’t entirely sure why. Then in 2014, a study confirmed that tianeptine can target the same receptors in the brain that addictive opioids do. Since then, there have been more accounts of people using tianeptine—either alone or in combination with other opioids—possibly to sustain their addiction, or because it may not show on typical drug screenings for opioids.In the mid- to late-2000s, the drug company Johnson & Johnson tried to get tianeptine approved in the U.S., though it ultimately shut down their efforts by 2012. Regardless, the drug—marketed as Coaxil or Stablon—can be bought online easily enough. Oftentimes, the drug is even sold as a “nootropic” dietary supplement, meant to boost cognition and mood, according to the CDC authors.The majority of symptoms reported in the poison center cells were mild, such as high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, and nausea. But there were also serious health problems reported, including kidney failure and coma. These symptoms were apparently more likely to happen in people who took tianeptine with other drugs. No deaths were reported in this study, but there have been possible deaths documented outside of the U.S. In March, doctors also reported the first two U.S. deaths associated with tianeptine toxicity.Though there’s no clear sense of how often people are abusing tianeptine, the CDC authors believe that experts, especially health providers, need to keep an eye on the situation. “In light of the ongoing U.S. opioid epidemic, any emerging trends in drugs with opioid-like effects raise concerns about potential abuse and public health safety,” they wrote.In April, Michigan became the first state to explicitly ban the drug, classifying tianeptine as a Schedule II controlled substance, the same category that illicit opioids already belong to.[CDC]",https://gizmodo.com/people-are-getting-sick-from-an-opioid-like-dietary-sup-1828094277,Health,Gizmodo,health,457

2017-12-12 00:00:00,2017,12.0,12,Vesa wants to make HDR screens more consistent with its new DisplayHDR specifications,"There are lots of HDR standards out there. Some might even say there are too many. But those standards largely are for brightness and color levels of different types of content. So long as the hardware supports the requirements of, say, HDR10 or Dolby Vision, you’ve been good to go. Vesa is a standards organization for displays — which you may recognize for its most well-known standard, the Flat Display Mounting Interface (aka the Vesa mount) — and it’s trying to make HDR hardware more consistent with its new certified DisplayHDR standards, according to AnandTech. These are less about making sure content is up to spec, and more focused on making screens more consistent. This way, if you see a display marketed as being a certified DisplayHDR panel, you know what you’re getting. The company is releasing three tiers of DisplayHDR certification, focused specifically on LCDs for now: DisplayHDR 400, DisplayHDR 600, and DisplayHDR 1000. The company also says to expect to see additional tiers to be added later on as technology continues to improve. All three levels are required to support the open HDR10 standard to receive certification, but there’s still a wide range of functionality between the base DisplayHDR 400 and the high-end DisplayHDR 1000. To hit the DisplayHDR 400 standard, a display only needs to offer global dimming, and reach a peak luminance of 400 cd/m2 (candela per meter squared, a standard unit of luminance), which is pretty much the bare minimum you can get away with and still have a benefit from HDR at all. DisplayHDR 600 increases the required specs to a peak luminance of 600 cd/m2, 10-bit image processing, and specifies a lower minimum black level and higher color gamuts. DisplayHDR 1000 takes that even higher with a peak luminance of 1000 cd/m2 and local dimming. With CES right around the corner, it’s likely that we’ll start seeing DisplayHDR-branded screens as early as the show, if not later in Q1 2018.",https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/12/16767160/vesa-displayhdr-specification-screen-monitor-hdr10-400-600-1000-standard,Tech,The Verge,technology,327

The firm, which was founded in 1972, just nabbed Mamoon Hamid as a general partner. Hamid co-founded Social Capital, and led investments there in Slack, OneLogin and other enterprise tech deals. Hamid confirmed the move in a blog post today calling Kleiner Perkins' Chairman John Doerr a role model. Doerr is famous for not just his investing acumen, but running a firm where seniority rules. New talent tends to move on from Kleiner, rather than rise in the ranks. Earlier this week, four of Kleiner's newer investment partners departed all around the same time, and the firm shut down its  ""Edge Program"" seed fund, Bloomberg reported. That program, and the partners managing it, were supposed to help keep Kleiner relevant and appealing to a new generation of start-ups. Kleiner's name used to show up in plenty of early-stage venture capital deals, and gained fame for being an early backer of Netscape, Google, and Amazon. But the firm has shifted lately to investing in later-stage rounds for hypergrowth tech start-ups -- according to Crunchbase data, this year more than half of its investments have been in later-stage start-ups. In later stages, shares in successful start-ups tend to cost more, and outsized returns on those investments are much harder to realize. Mature firms like Kleiner are facing an onslaught of competition for early-stage deals. Rising  ""microfunds"" are writing checks for seed and Series A deals without bigger, institutional VC's leading the way. Last year, industry tracker Prequin found 470 first-time funds looking to raise and invest in start-ups. These microfunds were looking to raise, on average, around $106 million for seed and early-stage follow-on deals. Social Capital was counted as a microfund just six years ago. Kleiner bringing on the co-founder of one of these growing, next-generation funds may signal that the firm is ready to incorporate not only new talent, but new ideas.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/03/kleiner-perkins-adds-mamoon-hamid-from-social-capital.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,332
2019-12-20 13:00:00,2019,12.0,20,I’m a Mother of Four. Palantir’s Tech Helped Put Me in an ICE Detention Center,"Maria Domingo Garcia is a factory worker and mother of four who is currently incarcerated at an ICE detention facility in Jena, Louisiana. This summer, I was one of the nearly 700 immigrants arrested in the massive ICE raid at a Koch Foods poultry plant in Morton, Mississippi, where I have worked for the past four years. It was the largest single-state workplace immigration raid in our nation’s history. As I found out later, this raid would not have been possible without technology provided by the private data firm Palantir. This is why I felt so angry when Palantir CEO Alex Karp argued that Silicon Valley companies like his are not responsible for making policy—all while providing the tools that enable the Trump administration’s mission to terrorize immigrant communities. I am from Guatemala, and I have been living in the US for 13 years. I have a partner, with two sons, aged 3 and 11, and a 5-month-old whom I was still breastfeeding up until the time that ICE tore her away from me. Currently, I am in a detention center in Jena, Louisiana, writing my truth to share with you. My husband is now having to raise our young children on his own. He tells me that they go to the playground often so that they don’t miss me too much. You have no idea what hearing that does to a mother. My children are suffering because they don’t understand why I’ve been taken away. At least they know I’ve done nothing wrong. But Palantir has done something wrong. They’ve received over $90m in contracts from ICE to provide technology that allows ICE to investigate undocumented workers that lead to workplace raids. This technology helped with the 7-11 raids in New York City last year, and the raids that led to my arrest. The morning of the raid, we heard the sound of helicopters and witnessed many children cry out for their parents as hundreds of workers were loaded into buses and taken away for processing. Similar scenes played out at six other food processing plants in Mississippi, resulting in nearly 700 arrests. In one fell swoop, hundreds of families were devastated. I’ve tried telling the detention center staff I was breastfeeding before being detained, but ICE simply called me a liar. They are anxious to prove I was never breastfeeding, but I know in my heart and God knows the truth. Not being able to breastfeed or pump has caused me a great deal of physical pain, and I am depressed from being torn away from my baby and my family. It should come as no surprise that these basic rights are being abused in ICE detention facilities. There have been countless stories reported about the inhumane conditions to which immigrants and asylum seekers are subjected. The CEO of Palantir would have everyone believe that his company plays no part in this cruel reality. In his recent Op-Ed, Alex Karp argued that we need to pressure the government to change policies, not companies like his. But the charge against me is that I was working. Is it a crime to support my family, to provide them a better life than I experienced growing up? Why am I now being treated like a criminal, and at times worse, like a useless animal? Is he proud his technology can be used to keep poor, hardworking people like me from my children? I came to the US over a decade ago, because I believed that my family would have access to opportunities to make a dignified life. What does it say about U.S. democracy that those who have some power in society are not willing to use that power to stand up and say, “not in our name?” You can’t easily wring your hands of this affair, Mr. Karp. This administration treats immigrants as less than human, and your company makes it possible for them to advance their racist agenda. Mr. Karp, you must respond to the American people and to the 12 million immigrants living in fear under the Trump administration for deciding who gets to use your tools to violate human rights. I ask you to stop enabling a racist agenda and drop Palantir’s ICE contracts. No more raids, no more mothers who cry themselves to sleep at night, and no more children who are angry and in pain without their parents’ love.

2019-07-23 00:00:00,2019,7.0,23,Senate Finance Committee unveils bipartisan bill to lower drug prices for seniors,"The Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday unveiled its long-anticipated bipartisan bill to lower prescription drug prices for seniors and save the federal government billions in health-care costs. Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the committee's ranking member, have been working for several months on a bill to reduce drug prices. The Trump administration and Congress are both trying to bring more transparency to drug prices and, ultimately, lower costs for consumers. The bill, ""Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019,"" would make changes to Medicare, the federal government's health insurance plan for the elderly, by adding an out-of-pocket maximum for beneficiaries at $3,100 starting in 2022. It would also penalize pharmaceutical companies if the price of their drugs rise faster than inflation. ""The cost of many prescription drugs is too high,"" Grassley and Wyden said in a joint statement Tuesday. ""Without action, we're on an unsustainable path for taxpayers, seniors and all Americans. A working class family shouldn't have to pick between making their rent or mortgage payment and being able to afford their kids' medications."" Spending on Medicare Part D drugs totaled $137 billion in 2015, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Total health-care spending in the U.S. represented 18% of gross domestic product, according to Medicare, and is expected to continue to rise. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will save U.S. taxpayers $85 billion over a 10-year period. It's also estimated to save beneficiaries $27 billion in out-of pocket costs. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry's main trade group, said it opposes the package, arguing it ""fails to meet the fundamental test of providing meaningful relief at the pharmacy counter for the vast majority of seniors."" ""We are committed to working with the Committee on a bipartisan basis on a better solution that balances cost savings with benefit to seniors,"" PhRMA President and CEO Stephen J. Ublsaid in a statement. In a conference call with reporters, Grassley's office said the senators have been in discussions with the Trump administration and the Department of Health and Human Services about the legislation. The office declined to say whether they expected the White House to support the bill as it currently stands. In a statement on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon, White House spokesman Judd Deere said the administration is ""encouraged by the bipartisan work"" of Grassley and Wyden. ""We will work with Senators to ensure this proposal moves forward and advances the President's priority of lowering drug prices even further and increasing transparency in healthcare for the benefit of all,"" Deere added. High prescription drug costs have become a rare bipartisan issue, with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle demanding changes. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's latest draft of drug price legislation would allow Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices and also apply those discounts to private health plans across the U.S. While Democrats support letting the government negotiate with drugmakers directly, opposition is strong among Republicans who say they want prices negotiated in a free market. The Trump administration has had a few roadblocks in its attempt to lower drug costs. Earlier this month, the White House said it had withdrawn its plan to ban rebates that drugmakers pay to pharmacy benefit managers. That news came three days after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., dealt a blow to the Trump administration by striking down a rule that would have forced pharmaceutical companies to disclose the list price of their drugs in television ads. Health policy analysts speculate the administration could next push for a proposal announced last year that would allow Medicare to create an ""international pricing index "" to bring drug prices in line with what other nations pay. Pharmaceutical companies fiercely oppose that legislation. Americans are increasingly in favor of more federal regulation to bring down high prescription drug prices, including letting the government negotiate directly with drugmakers, according to a survey from Kaiser.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/23/key-senate-panel-unveils-bipartisan-bill-to-lower-drug-prices-for-seniors.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,655
2016-06-26 11:30:00,2016,6.0,26,A Journey to Space Captures the Majesty of IMAX in 4K," What’s 4K UHD? How much better is it than Blu-Ray? What kind of TV and device player do you need? Is it really that much better? The world of high-definition home entertainment can seem confusing to people not invested in it; and a lot of these questions have subjective answers. Nevertheless, Ryan Mullins, head of Big Picture Digital Productions, answers them by bringing IMAX movies to the home screen. As Journey to Space, his first 4K transfer of an IMAX movie, hits shelves, Mullins tells The Creators Project about 4K and what it takes to bring huge movies to home cinemas. So what does a 4K Ultra HD television do that’s so different from an HD television? According to Mullins, it’s all about pixels on the screen. An HD television that’s as suped up as it can get has a 1920x1080 resolution, for a total of a little over 2 billion pixels on the screen. 4K has a (brace yourselves) 3840x2160 resolution, cramming a little over 8 billion pixels onto the screen. But to get there, Mullins says it took quite the effort. “It was a complete ecosystem change on the technology side,"" he explains. ""And it’s rare that this happens, that you have the original source format, you have a new disk created, a TV created, and that allowed an opportunity to change all the parameters. Not just to change the resolution.” Mullins got his start in VHS and DVDs, but is amazed at the power 4K provides. He says this new technology allows for better sound and a much wider range of colors presented on the screen. HD television sets, he says, “could recreate roughly 35% of the visual spectrum that the human eye can conceive, which is actually kind of low. Which gives a lot of HD a little bit of a cartoonish look.""  ""When we made the change over to UHD,"" Mullins continues, ""we increased the contrast levels to a much bigger range of light and dark, and there’s a wider color gamut where there’s more like 50 percent, maybe more, of the color spectrum. And it supports, though we’re not there yet, the possibility to capture up to 77% of the color spectrum.” The increase in colors presented with UHD, matched with a bolder difference between black and white, Mullins explains, means “more dimensionality to your image, whether it’s a canvas or a TV. So it’s quite a big change, and for packaged goods I think this is it.” Now, Mullins is taking advantage of all that technology with the space-documentary Journey to Space, distributed by Shout! Factory. The IMAX documentary, narrated by Captain Jean-Luc Picard himself, a.k.a. actor (and knight) Sir Patrick Stewart, provides an overview of where we’ve come in space exploration and where we’re headed. It evokes a sort of Space Age nostalgia rarely seen in popular culture these days, and the visuals, naturally, are jaw-dropping. When asked what compromises he had to make to bring this IMAX feature to UHD 4K, Mullins answers, “almost none. The first round of digital IMAX projectors were kind of 4K, they were using two projectors and a technology that used 2k projectors to make a 4K image. I’m putting out stuff that’s just slightly lower resolution. It’s been an interesting journey, we’ve met in the middle.""

2017-10-27 18:59:59,2017,10.0,27,"At Facebook, Hand-Wringing Over a Fix for Fake Content","SAN FRANCISCO — In June, Mark Zuckerberg spoke about “community” with a gathering of influential Facebook users in Chicago. It was an important moment for the 33-year-old chief executive of the social media company. He was promoting Facebook Groups, a product that millions of people on Facebook used to talk about shared interests, debate, discuss and maybe debate some more. This type of activity, he believed, was one of the keys to his sprawling company’s future. The goal of Facebook, he told his audience, which included many Groups leaders, was to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.” Inside Mr. Zuckerberg’s company, however, there was already growing concern among employees that some of that content was having the opposite effect. Foremost among the offending material: Posts and memes touching on hot-button issues like race, gender and sexuality that were secretly created by Russian organizations with ties to the Kremlin to influence the 2016 presidential election. Now there is an ongoing debate among Facebook employees over how to handle this so-called organic content, or posts from users that are not advertisements and can be freely shared across Facebook, according to a dozen current and former Facebook employees. These people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were prohibited by nondisclosure agreements from talking about the company. On one side are employees who idealize Facebook’s lofty goals of unfettered speech and do not think the company should be in the business of censoring what its users have to say. On the other side are workers who worry that the company’s hands-off approach has already caused problems — ones that will grow worse if nothing is done. “The algorithms Facebook sets up that prioritize and control what’s shown in its powerful newsfeed are a lot more consequential than the ads,” said Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who closely follows social media and technology. “The company seems stuck between exercising this massive power as it wishes, but also terrified about the conversation about its power and how to handle it.” Next week, Facebook’s general counsel will be among several tech industry executives expected to testify at a series of Congressional hearings about the role the technology industry played in Russian interference of last year’s election. Facebook has acknowledged that an organization with ties to the Kremlin purchased $100,000 worth of ads related to the election and has promised to crack down on such advertising. Since Facebook disclosed the existence of those ads and posts with Russian ties last month, the company has attempted to tamp down fears it abetted interference in the election. It has also added rules meant to improve disclosures of political advertising in an attempt to show users exactly who is behind the ads they saw run through their newsfeeds. And on Friday, the company began a test of new features designed to give users a better understanding of the people and organizations buying advertising on Facebook. That included providing users with a searchable database of ads being served to them. But misleading ads were often a small component of the misinformation campaign. Investigators believe the Internet Research Agency, a so-called troll farm that has been linked to the Kremlin, amassed enormous followings for various Facebook Pages that masqueraded as destinations for discussion about all sorts of issues, from the Black Lives Matter movement to gun ownership. Aided by Facebook’s finely tuned ad-targeting tools, the Russian firm would pay to place posts in the News Feeds of users. The ad product, called a “promoted post,” was designed to look little different than the rest of the content flowing through the News Feed. Users who responded in a positive manner to the advertisements were prompted to subscribe to related Facebook Pages or Groups run by the Russians. If they did, it meant that nonpaid, “organic” posts would begin to appear in the users’ News Feeds. From there they spread, being shared and reshared among the user’s network of friends. The tactic was effective. Some of the pages, like “Blacktivists,” which focused on racial issues, had more than 360,000 users who “liked” the page — even more than the main “Black Lives Matter” page. Facebook is not the only big internet company wrestling with the issue. But at Mr. Zuckerberg’s company, the issue has been particularly troublesome, given how easy it is to spread messages to tens of millions of Facebook users. Whether something is removed from Facebook is often dictated by its terms of service, which define standards of behavior on the network. Those standards prohibit posting nudity and threats of violence. But misleading users — even outright lying — aren’t necessarily against the rules. And that’s hard to police. So far, Facebook has focused on the issue of authenticity and identity on the platform. Facebook removed hundreds of ads last month, not because of the content they contained, but because the Russians running the pages did not disclose their real identities. “We want people to be able to come to Facebook to talk about issues of public interest, and we know that means people will sometimes disagree and the issues they discuss will sometimes be controversial,” Monika Bickert, head of product policy and counterterrorism at Facebook, said in a statement. “That’s O.K. But it’s important to us that these conversations happen in an authentic way, meaning we have to be speaking as ourselves, with our real identities.” That line of reasoning may not hold up for long, as Facebook is being forced to deal with policy discussions outside the United States. In Myanmar, Facebook is caught between the government and a persecuted minority group of Muslims, the Rohingya, who face a misinformation campaign on Facebook in posts often from top government leaders. Facebook has said little publicly about the situation but there is intensifying pressure to respond. One of the solutions discussed internally at Facebook has been “whitelisting,” in which algorithms would decide which content makers would be allowed to publish or advertise on Facebook, according to two people familiar with the company’s internal deliberations. They have also discussed “blacklisting,” in which the algorithms would decide which content makers could not post. But in closed-door meetings at Facebook’s Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters and in Washington, Facebook employees have expressed concern that such a move could have effects on other publications and content makers that are not spreading false or divisive news. Others worry that acting too hastily could establish precedents that would lead to a situation, for example, where human rights activists using Facebook to coordinate protests in Syria would be forced to identify themselves. They also worry that any effort to quash certain content in the United States could only aid censors in other countries. As for a technical solution, some hope artificial intelligence can help Facebook sift fact from fiction. But today’s A.I. technology is not advanced enough to do the work on its own. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr. Zuckerberg’s solution is to double down on his community concept. He has said publicly that strengthening social bonds on Facebook will lead to a positive outcome, despite whatever reservations his employees and the general public may have. “Every day, I say to myself, ‘I don’t have much time here on Earth, how can I make the greatest positive impact?’ Some nights I go to bed and I’m not sure I made the right choices that day,” Mr. Zuckerberg said at the June conference. “I can tell you, those doubts don’t go away, no matter who you are. But every day you just get up and try to make the world a little better.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/technology/facebook-fake-content-employees.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,1277
2019-09-12 00:00:00,2019,9.0,12,"Hepatitis C-infected kidneys function as well as others after transplant, study says"," (CNN)There has been a dramatic shift in how doctors use donated kidneys infected with hepatitis C that used to be thrown away. More transplant centers are willing to use kidneys infected with hepatitis C. That might sound risky, but with advances in treatment for hepatitis C, a new study finds the organs are viable and won't make a recipient ill. The study published in Journal of the American Society of Nephrology on Thursday found a threefold increase in the number of transplant centers using hepatitis C-infected kidneys.  Hepatitis C is a viral infection that causes liver inflammation, sometimes leading to serious damage. Prior to 2018, most of the infected organs went to patients who already had hepatitis C. Since 2018, most of these infected kidneys, about 75%, went to patients who did not have the virus.  Patients who received infected kidneys had nearly the same function as those who received uninfected kidneys, the study said.  ""The key thing about hepatitis C is that millions of Americans have this infection and most don't know that they have it, it's mild and takes many years for it to progress,"" said Dr. Vishnu Potluri, the lead author on the study and a nephrology fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. Until a few years ago, there weren't really good options to treat hepatitis C. Now, there are drugs with high cure rates, Potluri said. The transplant community realized that you could transplant a kidney from someone with hepatitis C and start treating them right away, Potluri said, and the early trials found the infection could be cured after the transplant. With the massive shortage of organs -- there are more than 100,000 people in the United States waiting for a donated kidney -- that will come as good news to patients with kidney failure. More than 37 million Americans have chronic kidney disease and roughly 5,000 die each year while on the kidney transplant waiting list; that's about 12 people each day. Kidney disease is the ninth leading cause of death in the United States. One-fifth of the spending of all of Medicare dollars pays for kidney care. But nearly 40% of the hepatitis C-infected kidneys donated between January 2018 and March 2019 were discarded. The study authors say this need not be the case. ""We think there is quite a bit of missed opportunity here for sure,"" said Potluri. He and his coauthors argue that the Kidney Donor Profile Index Calculator needs to be updated to better reflect modern science and take into consideration the evidence that organs from infected donors work just as well as uninfected organs. Earlier studies have shown that the United States is throwing away at least 3,500 donated kidneys every year for a wide variety of reasons. The small number of organs available for kidney failure patients is a major public health problem and one that President Donald Trump addressed in July when he signed an executive order promising to transform kidney care in the United States. His goal is to double the number of kidneys available for transplant by 2030. Potluri said the next phrase of the research will be to monitor how these kidneys function long-term. The research has only been tracking patients for a few years.   ""We will keep an eye on how a patient's immune system is reacting and what other effects may be happening. We need to be cautious and take a careful approach,"" Potluri said. ""I do think this is a small victory, but there are still many many organs that are being thrown away and we need to find other ways to prevent them from being discarded. That said, I think this is an important victory. If we could make even one extra kidney work and prevent it from being discarded, we think this is important for this community.""

The company showed off the Galaxy Z Flip in a 30-second ad during the awards show, two days before Samsung (SSNLF) is set to take the wraps off several new phones and products at its ""Unpacked"" keynote Tuesday.  The ad shows the phone in action, including flipping open to reveal one large screen. It also shows the phone ""sitting"" with the top of the screen facing vertically for a better video chat experience. Leaks of the Galaxy Z Flip have appeared in the wild, including on social media, for a while and the commercial appears to mirrors the speculation surrounding it.  Plenty remains unknown about the phone, such as the price, release date and specs. That will probably be unveiled during Tuesday's event, and the end of the ad promoted the live-streamed show.  The Galaxy Z Flip will be one of a small handful of foldable phones on the market. Samsung previously had trouble launching the Galaxy Fold, its 4.6 inch-smartphone that opens up into a 7.3-inch tablet. The phone went on sale last fall after several months of delays.  Then there's the reboot of the Motorola Razr for $1,500. That was released earlier this month and attracted rabid fans despite its lackluster features, including a small battery and plastic screen.

Huawei is currently on a U.S. blacklist that restricts American businesses selling products to the Chinese firm. The restrictions have affected Huawei's business as it relies on American suppliers for components and software in several of its products including smartphones and laptops. Huawei reported revenue over $100 billion for the first time in 2018 — about 19.5% higher than 2017. Ren's comments suggest that revenue growth will be roughly flat in 2019 and 2020. Ren said the company is also looking at creating different versions of its products. ""In the next two years, we are going to do a lot of switch over of different product versions that will take time and that will take time to ramp up, and it will take some time to test whether that works,"" he said in Mandarin, according to a Huawei translation. ""After that step, we will be stronger."" Ren did not specify whether this meant using components from different suppliers. Huawei has been developing its own operating system, which CNBC reported could be ready later this year in China. The company was also forced to scrap a planning laptop launch. Huawei's consumer business CEO Richard Yu told CNBC that the move was a result of the company being on the U.S. blacklist. Ren said the company will continue to work with American companies if it can. ""In the past, when we were not as strong, we were determined to work together with U.S. companies. In the future, we will be more determined to work with US companies. We are to afraid of using U.S. components, we are not afraid of using U.S. elements,"" Ren said.

Shares of the social media giant plunged as much as 8 percent after reports emerged over the weekend that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica used the data of over 50 million users of the social network without their permission. Zuckerberg, together with his affiliated organizations, like the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, has more than 403 million shares of Facebook stock — 9,347,183 Class A common shares and 393,938,853 Class B common shares, according to Courtney Yu, director of research at compensation data firm Equilar. Those shares are still worth about $68.5 billion. Despite his losses, Zuckerberg is still the fourth richest person in the world, behind Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, according to Bloomberg. With Monday's plunge, Facebook shares are down about 2.6 percent year-to-date. The stock pared losses slightly during Monday trading. Cambridge Analytica made headlines as the political data analytics firm that worked on Facebook ads for President Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election. Facebook blocked the firm's data harvesting app in 2015, and announced on Friday it suspended the firm for lying about deleting user data. Despite Facebook's insistence it has done what it can to protect users' data, the scuffle has stirred up discussion over tech regulations.

2016-11-04 00:00:00,2016,11.0,4,"Hidden digital ads pushing children to eat fatty food, health experts warn","LONDON (Reuters) - Children in Europe are bombarded with hidden digital advertising and marketing promoting fatty, sugary and salty foods that is damaging their health and adding to the region’s obesity problem, World Health Organization experts said on Friday. The researchers called for policymakers to do more to protect children from junk food advertising messages on networking sites, games - known as “advergames” - and other social media. “Our governments have given the prevention of childhood obesity the highest political priority, (yet) we consistently find that children – our most vulnerable group – are exposed to countless numbers of hidden digital marketing techniques promoting foods high in fat, sugar and salt,” said Zsuzsanna Jakab, the WHO’s regional director for Europe. She said in the absence of effective regulation of digital media in many countries, children are increasingly exposed to persuasive, individually tailored marketing techniques that parents may underestimate, or be unaware of. “Often, parents do not see the same advertisements, nor do they observe the online activities of their children; many therefore underestimate the scale of the problem,” said the WHO. About two-thirds of children who are overweight before puberty will be overweight in early adulthood, and an estimated 25 percent of school-aged children in Europe are already overweight or obese, said the report. Overweight and obese children are likely to stay obese into adulthood and more likely to develop chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease and cancer at a younger age. Gauden Galea, a WHO Europe expert on chronic disease and health promotion, said allowing advertisers and the food industry to target children like this could have “huge health and economic consequences”. The WHO Europe report said that since there is little effective regulation or control over of digital marketing, children are often exposed to powerful and targeted online marketing via digital platforms that collect personal data.

2017-01-22 00:00:00,2017,1.0,22,"Secure email service Lavabit relaunches, citing need for security in ‘post-Snowden world’","When Edward Snowden leaked details of the NSA’s mass surveillance program PRISM in 2013, he had been using a secure email service called Lavabit. Later that summer, the service shut down after the government ordered its owner to turn over the site’s encryption keys. Now, four years later, Lavabit is relaunching. On January 20th, Lavabit founder Ladar Levison published a note announcing that he was relaunching Lavabit. He explained that while much has changed since the site was originally closed down, “much has not in our post-Snowden world,” and alluded to some of the major email leaks that demonstrated some of the security issues that email faces. Former users of the service will be able to access their old accounts as well, and can migrate their accounts to the new protocols. The site will soon allow new users to sign up; they can preregister for the service at a discounted price, which normally will cost $30 for 5GB of storage or $60 for 20GB of storage. Levison also said that he is now releasing a 2013 Kickstarter project to the public. The project, Dark Internet Mail Environment (DIME) and an email server called Magma, is an open-sourced communications platform that provides end-to-end encryption. DIME provides three levels of privacy for users: Trustful, Cautious, & Paranoid, in a user-friendly interface. Lavabit was first launched in 2004 by programmers who had concerns about Gmail’s security, and allowed its 410,000 users to encrypt their emails. In the months following Snowden’s leaks, Levison told users that he was shutting down the service in order to protect the users of the site. He noted that he was unable to explain why, which led to speculation of a gag order. It turns out that he had been served with a search warrant that ordered him to turn over the system’s encryption and secure socket layer (SSL) keys. Rather than compromise his users, Levison opted to shut the site down. The timing of Lavabit’s relaunch isn’t coincidental: with his election, President Donald Trump has inherited a massive and powerful surveillance apparatus in the form of the various US intelligence agencies, which can operate with little oversight. This isn’t just a concern within the United States either: the United Kingdom recently granted its police and intelligence agencies unprecedented powers to monitor its citizens. Lavabit also returns at a time when there are more options for consumers to protect their traffic, such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger, both of which introduced end-to-end encryption last year.",https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/22/14350496/secure-email-service-lavabit-relaunches,Tech,The Verge,technology,416
2018-10-17 00:00:00,2018,10.0,17,"PrEP can 'significantly' reduce HIV rates across populations, study says"," (CNN)HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP, the use of drugs to prevent HIV infection, among men who have sex with men can significantly reduce new infections across an entire population of men, a new study finds. Based on introduction of the intervention, HIV infections diagnosed in men who have sex with men in the Australian state of New South Wales fell by a quarter -- 25.1% -- in one year in the research, published Wednesday in the journal the Lancet. Diagnoses fell from from 295 in October 2016, before the study, to 221 just 12 months after the PrEP rollout -- the lowest number since HIV surveillance started in New South Wales in 1985.  ""The speed and magnitude of response was remarkable,"" said Andrew Grulich, lead author of the paper and professor of the HIV epidemiology and prevention program at the Kirby Institute in the University of New South Wales. Grulich believes that the large decline is because PrEP ""is acting in a similar way to a vaccine,"" meaning herd immunity has led to fewer people becoming infected overall in the state of 7 million.  University College London professor of cellular and molecular virology Ariberto Fassati, who was not involved in the new research, explained that there is a ""benefit for the larger community if there is a core of individuals that are taking PrEP.""  In the study, 3,700 HIV-negative homosexual and bisexual men across 21 clinics in New South Wales were prescribed a daily dose of PrEP, followed up with HIV tests over one year.  HIV PrEP is made up of the drugs tenofovir and emtricitabine, taken before sex, and prevents people from becoming infected with HIV. For this study, the participants were prescribed 300 milligrams of tenofovir disoproxil dumarate and 200 milligrams of emtricitabine.  Only two of the 3,700 men were diagnosed as HIV-positive after the study; both were not adherent to the preventive treatment, according to the study.  The expected occurrence rate of HIV for this high-risk population in the absence of PrEP is at least 2 per 100 people.  The researchers identified men to be at high risk if they engaged in anal intercourse without condoms with casual partners of HIV-positive or unknown status, if they had a sexually transmitted infection such as rectal chlamydia or gonorrhea, if they used crystal methamphetamine or if they engaged in unprotected anal intercourse with a HIV-positive partner who isn't on treatment.  Statewide, the authors found 25% fewer HIV diagnoses after PrEP rollout. Recent cases, infections likely to have been acquired within the previous 12 months, were reported as 149 before the study and declined to 102, a 31.5% drop.  Declines were reported across all ages. The groups that saw the most rapid downturn were Australian-born men, those over 45 and men living in gay neighborhoods in Sydney. Will Nutland, honorary professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and PrEP activist, said the findings ""confirmed what we already suspected.""  ""It is exciting but not surprising,"" said Nutland, who was not involved in the study. Previous studies have proved the efficacy of PrEP.  French and Canadian research showed effectiveness levels of 86% during daily or intermittent PrEP courses, with only men who were non-adherent becoming infected with HIV. San Francisco witnessed a 50% decline of HIV diagnoses between 2012 and 2016, after PrEP was introduced.  The new study had a wider and faster reach. Grulich's team used mathematical models to calculate the effects of the preventive drug on entire populations. ""If you introduce PrEP rapidly and target it to high-risk people, you get a rapid reduction in HIV,"" he said. But Nutland said it is hard to ""unpick the direct impact with PrEP compared to other HIV prevention methods."" Early interventions for HIV-positive patients, like treatment as prevention -- which reduce the virus' presence to an undetectable and therefore untransmittable level -- make it impossible for a HIV-positive person to pass on the virus.  Fassati said it would be helpful to see a long-term analysis of PrEP's effect on populations. He also would like to see the results replicated in communities that are not so adherent or motivated, as PrEP's effectiveness is much reduced if it is not taken regularly.  PrEP has been introduced in several countries. England offers the preventive treatment for men who have sex with men in its National Health Service. But there has been some pushback due to claims that it would encourage sex without a condom. Another problem some men face is the cost of the drug. ""If PrEP can be provided in a target way, high coverage rate, for free and easily accessible in clinics, then this removes some of the barriers of accessing PrEP, as we have seen in the USA,"" Nutland noted. The preventive regimen can have short-term side effects such as stomach and headaches, and in the longer term, it could lead to kidney toxicity. Another effect of the drug, as PrEP user Nutland has described it, is a reduction in fear and anxiety over having sex. ""It makes our collective sex lives way better than they has ever been,"" he said.  The new study is ""another reminder is that PrEP works,"" Nutland said, ""and this should galvanize our policy-makers and politicians to make PrEP available for those who need it most, as soon as possible.""

2019-04-16 00:00:00,2019,4.0,16,Most type 2 diabetes apps lack real-time advice on blood sugar management," (This April 16 story corrects paragraph 1 to indicate the study came from Singapore) By Lisa Rapaport (Reuters Health) - Hundreds of smartphone apps promise to make managing type 2 diabetes easier, but very few offer real-time guidance on what to do for dangerously high or low blood sugar, a study from Singapore suggests. Researchers looked at 5,185 apps for phones running Google’s Android software or Apple’s iOS system. Out of this total, they found 371 apps that claimed to provide several key components for type 2 diabetes management: recording blood sugar data; reminding patients when they need to do specific things to manage the illness; and educating patients on how to handle conditions like dangerously low or high blood sugar. “People with diabetes will need to make many decisions relating not only to diet and lifestyle but also which medication to take and what dose depending on their blood sugar levels,” said senior study author Dr. Josip Car of the Centre for Population Health Sciences at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. “Apps could potentially support some aspects of self-management - if well-designed,” Car said by email. “But our study demonstrates the immaturity of diabetes apps and missed opportunities to improve care and health outcomes.” The study focused only on patients with type 2 diabetes, the most common form, which is associated with obesity and aging and happens when the body can’t properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy. Left untreated, diabetes can lead to nerve damage, amputations, blindness, heart disease and strokes. Roughly one in 13 people with diabetes who own smartphones use an app to help them manage their condition, researchers note in JAMA. Earlier studies suggested that using an app that supports blood sugar management may help people achieve lower blood sugar than they can on their own, the study team writes. Every app in the current analysis allowed people to record blood sugar levels. But just 37 percent let people set goals like a target blood sugar level, and only 28 percent gave patients reminders to check their blood sugar. Roughly 58 percent of the apps alerted users when they had dangerously high or low blood sugar levels. But only 21 percent of the prompts warning about low blood sugar offered suggestions for what to do about it, and just 15 percent of warnings about high blood sugar gave this kind of guidance. When people did get advice on how to handle dangerously low blood sugar, the apps suggested that people consume food, juice or sugar just about 14 percent of the time - about as often as the apps advised patients to seek medical help. With dangerously high blood sugar, the apps that gave advice told people to seek medical help about 13 percent of the time, and proposed insulin about three percent of the time. The study can’t prove whether or how apps might directly impact health outcomes for people with diabetes. Another limitation is that the apps were reviewed in December, 2018, and features might have changed since then. “Smartphone apps can be a great way to track health data, but there are many inconsistencies, flaws, and shortcomings that need to be worked out,” said Dr. Kevin Platt of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “There is tremendous variability in available apps, and there is minimal regulatory control to ensure content is accurate or efficacious,” Platt, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. As the study shows, patients who rely on the apps for medical advice may not get what they need when they need it, said Sheri Colberg of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. “Many of these apps did have alerts for blood glucose out of range, but little usable advice to follow the alerts,” Colberg, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “For example, the message ‘seek medical help’ is not useful to most if they lack easy access to medical care or the financial means to do so,” Colberg added. “Self-management has been shown to work better but requires diabetes education not provided by most of these apps.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2VUrEQZ JAMA, online April 16, 2019.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-diabetes-apps/most-type-2-diabetes-apps-lack-real-time-advice-on-blood-sugar-management-idUSKCN1RS26Y,Health News,Reuters,health,699
2018-02-06 00:00:00,2018,2.0,6,Facebook critics need some 'perspective': Nir Eyal,"The author of a best-selling book on designing technology products says the ongoing criticism of social media companies is ""very healthy"" yet in need of some ""perspective."" ""It's great that we're looking at the industry with a critical lens, [and] very healthy for us to ask whether technology is serving us or we are serving it,"" said Nir Eyal, author of the 2013 book ""Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products."" ""But we need to keep some perspective,"" added Eyal, who has taught a course at Stanford University based on the principles in his book. ""We're not freebasing Facebook or injecting Instagram. If you turn off notifications from Twitter, they won't bother you. If you uninstall Facebook, there's nothing Mark Zuckerberg can do about it."" His comments, made in a phone interview with CNBC, come as criticism of Facebook, Google and Twitter intensifies. Some of their former employees recently formed a group called the Center for Humane Technology that's dedicated to weaning users away from the technologies they helped build. Last week a group of child advocates called on Facebook to shut down a version of its Messenger Kids app targeted at children. That criticism comes after Facebook's own research unit found that passively consuming content on the site, rather than using it to connect with others, can be bad for users' mental health. While he applauds the intentions of those wanting to counteract the negative impact of heavy social media use, Eyal says the techniques being used by these companies can also be used for positive outcomes. ""The same techniques used by Facebook are also used to help people exercise more, save money, learn a new language or stay connected with loved ones."" It's important for online consumers to remember that they ultimately have control over their online behavior, according to Eyal. If not, little may change. ""Users need to be proactive,"" Eyal said. ""If we sit around holding our breath, waiting for companies to change, it may never happen."" Although some have referred to the problem of heavy social media use as an addiction, Eyal says there's an important distinction. ""We're not helpless and these products are not irresistible. An addiction is when you know something's bad for you, (you) want to stop and can't. It's not the product itself but the interaction between the product and the user. A lot of people get morphine in the hospital but only a tiny fraction get addicted.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/06/facebook-critics-need-some-perspective-nir-eyal.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,406
2016-04-20 00:05:27,2016,4.0,20,White Americans Are Dying Younger as Drug and Alcohol Abuse Rises,"WASHINGTON — Life expectancy declined slightly for white Americans in 2014, according to new federal data, a troubling sign that distress among younger and middle-age whites who are dying at ever-higher rates from drug overdoses is lowering average life spans for the white population as a whole. The new federal data, drawn from all deaths recorded in the country in 2014, showed that life expectancy for whites dropped to 78.8 years in 2014 from 78.9 in 2013. Men and women had declines, but because of statistical rounding, the decline did not appear as sharp among men. Life expectancy for women fell to 81.1 in 2014 from 81.2 in 2013. The average life span for men also fell, but not enough to sink below 76.5 years, their life expectancy in 2013. “The increase in death in this segment of the population was great enough to affect life expectancy at birth for the whole group,” said Elizabeth Arias, the statistician at the National Center for Health Statistics who analyzed the data, referring to whites from their mid-20s to their mid-50s. “That is very unusual.” Dr. Arias, who is preparing a larger study of mortality trends over the past 15 years, said drug overdoses, liver disease and suicide were the main drivers of the gloomy trends among whites in recent years, a pattern also found by other researchers. Life expectancy for whites had been rising for decades, but it has stagnated in recent years. It inched up in 2010 and 2011, and was flat in 2012 and 2013. Recent research has documented surprising increases in death rates among less educated whites. Last year, a paper by Anne Case and Angus Deaton documented rising death rates among middle-age white Americans, particularly those with no more than a high school education. Other research has found rising rates among younger whites. The pattern had puzzled demographers, but the recent analyses have pointed to suffering and anxiety among working-class whites. In contrast, life expectancy for blacks rose to 75.6 in 2014 from 75.5 in the previous year. Blacks have gained more than a year of life expectancy since 2008. Black men had the biggest increase of all the groups in 2014, rising to 72.2 from 71.8. For Hispanics, life expectancy jumped to 81.8 in 2014 from 81.6 in 2013. Hispanic women had even more pronounced gains, with life expectancy rising to 84 years from 83.8 in 2013. Overall, Hispanics, like blacks, have gained one year of life expectancy since 2008. The overall life expectancy for Americans, 78.8, remained unchanged. The last time life expectancy for whites dropped was in 2005, around the time of a particularly severe flu season, though it is not clear that flu caused the decline. The most recent dip before that was in 1993, around the time of the AIDS epidemic, when there was a decline in life expectancy for the entire United States population. The drop was steepest among blacks, whose life expectancy dropped to 69.2 from 69.6 in one year. Typically, most of the deaths in the country occur among people in their 60s or older. Deaths in people who are younger or middle age are relatively rare and do not usually affect overall life expectancy. A surge in death rates at those ages is sometimes analogous to a generation of men going to war or a wave of mothers’ deaths in childbirth. “There is the expectation that life expectancy will go up every year, and that has been realized just about every year over the past century,” said Samuel Preston, a demographer at the University of Pennsylvania.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/20/health/life-expectancy-decline-mortality.html,health,The New York Times,health,597
2019-01-25 00:00:00,2019,1.0,25,Lactalis recalls baby milk from Spanish site linked to salmonella,"PARIS (Reuters) - Dairy group Lactalis said on Friday it was recalling one of its infant formula brands as a precautionary move as the product was supplied by the same Spanish factory linked to several salmonella cases among babies in France. The company said its LNS unit was withdrawing 16,300 tins of “Picot AR” infant formula sold in French pharmacies since Nov. 29, following a wider recall issued by fellow French firm Savencia’s Sodilac division. “We are applying a principle of maximum precaution and underline that no health alert has been issued regarding Picot AR and that all product tests have been normal,” Lactalis said in a statement. Other products from the Picot range were not supplied by the same factory and so were not affected by the recall, it said. Sodilac has recalled all products under its Modilac brand after the French health authorities linked the contamination of four babies with salmonella with the consumption of Modilac formula supplied by a factory in Spain. In an update, France’s public health agency said a total of seven cases of the ‘salmonella poona’ virus in babies between late August and Jan. 10 were now suspected of being due to consumption of Modilac product from the Spanish site. Four of the babies had been treated in hospital but all were later discharged, it said. The alert comes a year after a massive recall of infant formula by Lactalis, the world’s largest dairy group, after dozens of babies contracted salmonella. The alert, linked to a factory in northwest France, drew criticism about a lack of transparency at Lactalis and led the company to close permanently one of its production lines. The disruption to its infant formula production in France led it to start using the Spanish factory for its Picot AR brand, a spokesman said.

2016-07-19 19:14:00,2016,7.0,19,Here's Twitter's Response to the Racist Harassment of Leslie Jones,"Leslie Jones, one of the stars of the new Ghostbusters movie, spent most of Monday night swatting off an anonymous tirade of Twitter eggs who flooded her mentions with racist and sometimes violent tweets. This morning, after several hours of reporting and blocking users—the only available means of ""preventing"" harassment on Twitter—the actress gave up, and announced she would be leaving the site. Exposing Leslie JonesJuly 18, 2016 #MAGA ManJuly 19, 2016 I just don't understand Leslie JonesJuly 18, 2016 Leslie JonesJuly 18, 2016 Twitter's anti-harassment mechanisms are still bad, and once again, it's taken the targeting of a celebrity to magnify just how bad they are for everyone. And though we've been here before, the simple question still remains: Why doesn't Twitter do anything about it? There's certainly no shortage of suggestions from experts that Twitter could tap into. In 2015, the Electronic Frontier Foundation published some thoughts and measures the company could adopt to better protect its users. Included were new policies and tools, but also guidances for how to define abuse (for example, ""trolls"" are not the same ilk as abusers), how not to police content, and how to expand transparency. Another option would be to hire a staff of full-time mods whose sole job would be finding and fielding harassment. Twitter: Take some money and hire people who actually use the service all day. Give them banning power. Watch! Stop waiting for reports. One proposal that's popped up time and time again is the ability to block all replies to a single tweet, or even block replies from users you don't follow. Twitter is public, but should harassment and openness be mutually inclusive? Currently, when a user like Jones—or you or I, for that matter—wants to stop someone from tweeting truly repugnant shit at them, there are two options at hand: block them, or report them. The first strategy prevents a user from being able to see your tweets or follow you when they're logged in. However, according to Twitter's own rules, blocking ""only works if the account you've blocked is logged in on Twitter. For example, if the account you've blocked isn't logged in or is accessing Twitter content via a third party, they may be able to see your public tweets."" This also doesn't necessarily stop someone from creating a new account to contact you, or showing up in your mentions. Twitter's reporting feature, which allows users to flag behavior that violates their guidelines, isn't much better. For starters, it can take a significant amount of time to submit a complaint. In some cases, Twitter asks that you provide examples of abusive content, which in theory makes sense, but in practice can be difficult when you're being dogpiled by hundreds of persistent users, such as Jones was. And once you actually file the complaint, reviewers may or may not approve your request. A third-party audit conducted by Women, Action, & the Media in 2015 found that when people reported allegedly abusive users, Twitter took action 55 percent of the time, and very rarely deleted offending accounts. I reached out to Twitter and asked whether the company had plans to implement new tools for combating harassment. A spokesperson offered the following statement (the same one that was first provided to BuzzFeed News last night): ""This type of abusive behavior is not permitted on Twitter, and we've taken action on many of the accounts reported to us by both Leslie and others. We rely on people to report this type of behavior to us but we are continuing to invest heavily in improving our tools and enforcement systems to prevent this kind of abuse. We realize we still have a lot of work in front of us before Twitter is where it should be on how we handle these issues."" Twitter co-founder and CEO, Jack Dorsey, requested that Jones DM him last night, so I also inquired whether or not they had discussed her experience with harassment on Twitter. Representatives did not reply, nor did they address my question about how and when they plan to ""invest heavily in improving"" their tools. Jones is no stranger to the type of hatred that's allowed to filter through Twitter's porous anti-harassment policies. Opponents of the all-female Ghostbusters reboot have been virulently voicing their distaste with the film's new direction since it was first announced in 2015, claiming its more diverse (albeit, still mostly white) casting decision ""ruined their childhood,"" or was part of a nefarious SJW agenda. Most of these remarks were centralized on YouTube or Reddit, however, the movie's actors were also confronted by their critics on Twitter. Earlier this year, a subset of people who accused the film's writers of stereotyping Jones' character (a black, ""street savvy"" New York transportation employee) nearly pushed the actress to abandon her account after Twitter users began to personally attack her online. Former Twitter CEO, Dick Costolo, once admitted the platform sucks at ""dealing with abuse and trolls,"" and that they've sucked at it for years. None of this is new. But hey, Twitter just launched a new application process for fancy blue checkmarks, so if all else fails, maybe try to get verified. Seriously. Will checkmarks for everyone solve the problem of harassment? Probably not, but it's better than the status quo. Update: Tuesday, July 19: According to a statement provided to BuzzFeed News and Recode, Twitter has permanently suspended Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos for organizing and inciting targeted abuse online. The decision to revoke his access was reportedly in response to the harassment of actress Leslie Jones, which Yiannopoulos actively participated in and helped to instigate. This isn't the first time Twitter has taken disciplinary action against the alt-right icon. Earlier this year, Yiannopoulos lost his verification for allegedly violating Twitter's abusive behavior policy—a move that Breitbart likened to ""declaring war on conservative media."" Yiannopoulos' account, which had nearly 400,000 followers as of today, has been temporarily suspended before, but only for brief amounts of time. In its most recent statement, Twitter admits that ""many people believe we have not done enough to curb this type of behavior."" A spokesperson for the company repeated the assurance that the company is investing heavily in better anti-harassment tools, but it remains unclear what exactly that means, and when any changes might happen. It's worth noting that Twitter's response to the recent attacks has resulted in the banning of only a single user, as far as we can tell. And the company's decision to chop the head off the snake, so to speak, could instigate an avalanche of residual harassment toward other individuals. What is clear, however, is that Twitter has experimented with warnings and permanent suspensions in the past, and yet here we are. Has anything really changed? Below is Twitter's statement regarding Yiannopoulos: ""People should be able to express diverse opinions and beliefs on Twitter. But no one deserves to be subjected to targeted abuse online, and our rules prohibit inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others. Over the past 48 hours in particular, we've seen an uptick in the number of accounts violating these policies and have taken enforcement actions against these accounts, ranging from warnings that also require the deletion of Tweets violating our policies to permanent suspension. We know many people believe we have not done enough to curb this type of behavior on Twitter. We agree. We are continuing to invest heavily in improving our tools and enforcement systems to better allow us to identify and take faster action on abuse as it's happening and prevent repeat offenders. We have been in the process of reviewing our hateful conduct policy to prohibit additional types of abusive behavior and allow more types of reporting, with the goal of reducing the burden on the person being targeted. We'll provide more details on those changes in the coming weeks.""",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pgkz37/heres-twitters-response-to-the-racist-harassment-of-leslie-jones,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,1315
2017-09-27 00:00:00,2017,9.0,27,"Abortion: Nearly half performed each year worldwide are unsafe, study says"," (CNN)Dr. Lisa Haddad remembers the women's faces clearly. Since 2008, the obstetrician-gynecologist has been traveling to sub-Saharan Africa. While working in Zambia, she saw gynecologic units in the hospital filled with women admitted with heavy bleeding or life-threatening infections, she said. The women often would remain tight-lipped about why they were hemorrhaging, but Haddad said that it was clear to her and the Zambian clinicians what was happening. Some of the women had unsafe abortions and were facing serious complications, she said. ""This is a public health priority and I don't think it's been placed on that level and given the attention that it needs,"" said Haddad, associate professor in the department of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University School of Medicine. A new study finds nearly half of all 55.7 million estimated abortions around the world each year between 2010 and 2014 were performed in an unsafe manner, putting women at risk for serious complications.  The study, published Wednesday in the journal The Lancet, suggests that unsafe abortions are still a major health problem globally, especially in developing countries. ""These are the first global estimates to show the distribution of the abortions across three safety categories,"" said Dr. Bela Ganatra, a scientist at the department of reproductive health and research at the World Health Organization and lead author of the study. ""For the first time, we actually tried to determine the conditions under which abortions take place, how, who, where. This allows us to develop a better understanding of actions needed,"" she said.  Based on the WHO definition, an unsafe abortion results from a pregnancy that is terminated either by someone who lacks the necessary medical skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards, or both. Unsafe abortions can lead to complications, such as heavy bleeding, infection, damage to genitals or internal organs, or an incomplete abortion, such as when all of the pregnancy tissue is not removed from the uterus, according to WHO. Complications related to unsafe abortions sometimes can be fatal. ""I think that there's no question that unsafe abortion continues to be one of the leading causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, and importantly this is preventable,"" said Haddad, who was not involved in the new study. Abortions performed by trained providers through evidence-based approaches are safe, she said. Counting unsafe abortions The study, conducted by an international team of researchers at WHO and Guttmacher Institute, involved 150 pieces of data from 61 countries on both safe and unsafe abortions performed around the world between 2010 and 2014.  The information was collected from previous surveys and studies, bibliographic databases, and ministries of health or national statistical organizations. The researchers analyzed the data to determine how many abortions fit within the WHO's definition of ""unsafe."" They found that, in total, about 55.7 million abortions occurred annually worldwide between 2010 and 2014. Among those abortions, about 25.1 million were performed in unsafe circumstances each year -- with about 17.1 million being ""less safe"" and 8 million being ""least safe,"" the researchers found.  Overall, almost all abortions in developed countries were deemed safe, whereas roughly half of those in developing countries were safe, according to the findings.  ""Among the developed regions, the distributions of abortions across the safety categories were similar with the majority of abortions being performed under safe conditions, except for Eastern Europe, where 14% were less safe,"" Ganatra said. ""While both Africa and Latin America had low proportions of abortions that were carried out in safe conditions, it was striking to note that among the unsafe abortions, the vast majority in the Latin America region were performed under less safe conditions (59.7%) while in Africa the majority of unsafe abortions were performed under the least safe conditions (48%),"" she said. ""It is also important to note that women undergoing abortions in Africa had the highest risk of dying from a least safe abortion."" Eastern Asia, including China, had a distribution similar to developed regions, Ganatra said. Yet in South-Central Asia, less than one in two abortions were safe. ""The paper did not examine country specific data, but other evidence shows that the same disparities exist within countries as well -- between rural and urban, rich and poor,"" Ganatra said. Such a disparity often emerges when any health outcome is measured in developed versus developing regions, but safe abortion care is possible in developing countries, Ganatra said. She pointed to Nepal, Ethiopia, and Uruguay as examples of countries that have made progress in expanding access to safe abortion procedures, she said. A separate study found that in 2012 almost 7 million women were treated for complications of unsafe abortions in the developing world. The study published in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 2015. 'She really saw no other option for herself' The researchers wrote in the new study, ""this analysis suggested that unsafe abortion is still a major problem in developing countries and that progress towards safer abortion is needed, even in some developed countries."" Yet the study came with several limitations due to the dearth of data. ""They're basing their data on other studies and numbers that are available and those numbers that are out there are limited based on their ability to estimate the true incidence,"" Haddad said. ""So, they're likely underestimates."" The researchers themselves noted in the study that, in general, empirical data on abortions were scarce, especially in countries where abortions were legally restricted, stigmatized or less likely to be reported. ""This study gives us the first global estimates of how often women are able to find safe abortions, even if they are not getting legal abortions. It is very difficult to accurately measure abortion and abortion-related mortality, especially in countries where it is illegal. These may be the best estimates possible and yet still be an undercount,"" said Diana Greene Foster, professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the new study. ""I have studied women who are unable to get a legal abortion in six countries: the United States, Colombia, Tunisia, South Africa, Bangladesh and Nepal. Even where abortion is supposed to be legal and available, many women are unable to access services within the medical system,"" she said. ""Some women facing an unwanted pregnancy go on to get illegal, but safe, abortions, some get illegal unsafe abortions and some carry the unwanted pregnancy to term."" Emory University's Haddad said that she remembers traveling to Nepal as a medical student around 2005, after the South Asian country liberalized some of its abortion restrictions. Knowledge of those reduced restrictions was not widespread, she said. ""We had a woman who came in the clinic who was right above the gestational age limit to which abortion was legal. ... It was very clear that she was seeking any way to end the pregnancy,"" Haddad said. ""She spoke openly about suicide as an option rather than continuing with the pregnancy."" The woman was desperate because she was raped while her husband was away and she feared what would happen when her husband would return to find her pregnant, Haddad said. ""She really saw no other option for herself. ... I don't know whatever happened with her, but I can't imagine that it was good,"" Haddad said. ""It spoke to me because she did nothing on her own to get herself in that situation and saw no way out of it, and there was nothing I could do,"" she said. ""And unfortunately, irrelevant of what people think of abortion, you can't ignore the fact that this is a crisis that is avoidable.""

2018-06-19 00:00:00,2018,6.0,19,California deals with dementia among aging inmates,"STOCKTON, Calif. (Reuters) - California prison inmate Richard Arriola does not remember the digestion problems that drove him to the doctor on a recent morning, or details of the conviction for child molestation that sent him to prison at age 88.  Arriola is one of about 18,400 inmates over the age of 55 in California prisons, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.   It is a swelling population that has led authorities to take the first steps toward creating a dementia unit at the state’s main prison medical facility in the San Joaquin Valley city of Stockton, Reuters has learned.   “We have identified a specific need for a specialized unit for our dementia population and are in the very early phases of concept development,” said Elizabeth Gransee, spokeswoman for California Correctional Health Care Services.  The wing would mark a shift from California’s earlier efforts to treat prisoners with cognitive decline, relying on inmate volunteers and a modest staff to help them rather than a more expensive medical unit.   Reuters visited two California prisons recently to look at the challenges states face, as improved medical care, long sentences from tougher crime laws, and a steady increase of older adults entering prison has contributed to an extraordinary rise of elderly inmates.  In California, seven percent of the state’s 130,000 prisoners were over the age of 60 in 2016, the most recent year for which data is available, compared to just 1 percent 20 years earlier, according to a report by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.   “We and all of the jails and prisons around the country need to be able to do a better job with individuals who have cognitive impairment,” said Dr. Joseph Bick, chief medical executive at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville.  Throughout the United States, states are grappling with similar challenges as prisoners age. Inmate medical costs amount to about $3 billion per year nationwide, according to a recent report by the state of Georgia, where medical care for inmates over the age of 65 costs $8,500 per year, compared to $950 for those who are younger, the report showed.  Nationwide, 44 percent of inmates over the age of 50 have disabilities, compared to 27 percent of prisoners overall, a 2015 report by the Department of Justice shows. About 20 percent have cognitive disabilities, the report showed.  ROUND-THE-CLOCK CARE  Prisoners with cognitive decline can require round-the-clock care and help with dressing themselves, brushing teeth and going to the restroom. Because prison life - and for many, life on the streets before prison - is so difficult, inmates are considered geriatric after the age of 55 in California and many other states.   Arriola, who is housed with about 2,600 prisoners with chronic conditions at the California Health Care Facility in Stockton, came on a Thursday morning in May for a follow-up visit with a gastroenterologist. But he talked distractedly to the doctor, and said he did not recall having stomach problems.  It is not an uncommon situation at the Stockton facility, where physicians and nurses are trained to work with an increasing number of patients experiencing cognitive decline, said Dr. Anise Adams, the chief medical officer.  About 500 prisoners are being treated for dementia or Parkinson’s Disease in California prisons, including 200 at Stockton, officials said.  “It’s hard for them to explain to the nurses what they want or how they feel,” said inmate Scottie Glenn, 47, who participates in a program in which able-bodied inmates help those who are ill.  On a recent May morning, Glenn, who is serving 25 years to life for murder, was assisting a wheelchair-bound inmate who needed to see a doctor. Sometimes, he writes letters for inmates, or helps them to communicate.  Older inmates’ needs have led the state to build a large dialysis center, stock hundreds of wheelchairs and offer assistance with hearing and declining vision. Stockton’s medical facility has a physical therapy center, and a palliative care unit is set to open in the next few weeks.  The California Medical Facility in Vacaville set up a hospice decades ago during the AIDS crisis, which now houses more inmates dying of old age diseases, officials said. The state expects to spend about $26,000 per inmate on health care next year.  Once a dementia unit is set up, California would follow New York, which opened one for its much smaller prison population in 2006. New York spends about $2.7 million annually to care for 29 patients in the unit, the state corrections department said.   California officials say it is too soon to know how much the unit they hope to create will cost, but it would not be difficult to re-purpose an existing ward for use by dementia patients.      Such patients wake up in the middle of the night not knowing where they are, requiring trained staff to comfort them. Others behave in ways that normally get an inmate in trouble, such as batting away a doctor’s hand during an injection.  In a normal prison ward, that is considered assault, said Captain Paul Vasquez, whose job includes reviewing behavioral issues at the Stockton facility.  Inmates can be handcuffed, lose privileges and even be sent to the Security Housing Unit, where prisoners are kept in near-isolation, he said.  “We need to learn to respond to them a different way - and not in a regular mainline type of prison,” Vasquez said.

2019-05-09 00:00:00,2019,5.0,9,"Hepatitis A infections increased by nearly 300% over two years, report says"," (CNN)Hepatitis A, a vaccine-preventable illness, like measles, has made a resurgence among adults in the United States who are at risk for the infection, according to a new report.  Researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed the number of cases reported to the agency through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System from 2013 to 2018.  Hepatitis A infections increased 294% between 2016 and 2018, according to the study, published Thursday in the MMWR weekly report. This disease of the liver is caused by a virus. Stomach pain, low appetite, nausea, fatigue and jaundice are common symptoms, which usually end within two months, once the body clears the infection. The highly contagious virus is transmitted by eating contaminated food, through close personal and sexual contact, or through drug use. Most people who get hepatitis A recover completely and don't have lasting liver damage, but in rare cases, the infection can cause liver failure and even death.  Outbreaks of the infection have occurred in several states since 2016 and have been associated with contaminated food items, sexual transmission among men who have sex with men, people who use drugs and those who experience homelessness, according to the CDC.  For many states, the resurgence has represented unprecedented levels since the vaccine became available in 1996. There was a 95% decline in hepatitis A cases from 1996 to 2011. But from 2016 to '18, the agency received approximately 15,000 reports of the illness.  The CDC recently reported that since 2016, there have been 8,500 hospitalizations and at least 140 deaths nationwide more than would be expected with hepatitis A.   ""The risk of disease occurs when vaccines are foregone,"" Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, said last week. ""Hepatitis A vaccinations have been routine for young children for some years, and the outbreak occurs primarily in adults."" In the past, hepatitis A outbreaks happened every 10 to 15 years in children who showed no symptoms of the illness. Children are now routinely vaccinated at age 1.  But a large number of adults who did not receive the vaccine or have the infection as children, remain vulnerable to the virus from contaminated food and on a larger scale through behaviors like drug use, the new report explains.  The rise in the number of cases also comes as an infectious disease consequence of the nation's opioid crisis, the authors added.  ""Increasing vaccination among groups at risk for hepatitis A infection might halt ongoing outbreaks and prevent future outbreaks,"" the authors explained. One dose of the hepatitis A vaccine provides protection in 95% of instances for up to 11 years, according to the CDC.

""I'm hopeful that these things get resolved,"" Rometty told CNBC's Karen Tso, speaking about trade tensions between the two countries. ""But I also say that with all the talk about tariffs and the like around physical goods, some of what needs to be resolved are the rules around digital trade."" Rometty defined such digital trade as the flow of data between countries, arguing that the exchange of information was as important as lifting trade barriers when it comes to physical imports. ""That's almost more important that there be free flow of data across borders and there not be localization of data,"" she said. ""So those are all very serious issues to be worked on and I'm hopeful the trade talks address those things."" Concerns have been raised by industry leaders over the potential for the U.S. and China to drift further apart when it comes to data and the internet. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, for instance, has warned there could be a ""bifurcation"" in the internet, with one network led by America and the other led by China. It comes amid a spike in trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. The U.S. recently raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10%, while China retaliated on $60 billion worth of U.S. imports. President Donald Trump has also threatened to impose levies on a remaining $325 billion worth of Chinese goods imported to the U.S. The Trump administration also recently declared a national emergency over the threat to American technology, adding Huawei to a list that would make it more difficult for the Chinese telecom giant to conduct business with U.S. companies.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/16/ibm-ceo-on-us-china-trade-war-tariffs.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,312
2019-05-17 00:00:00,2019,5.0,17,American Births Hit a 32-Year Low,"Photo:  Getty ImagesAmericans are continuing to have fewer and fewer children, according to a new government report released this week. Slightly fewer than 3.8 million children were born in 2018, the report found—a 2 percent decrease from 2017, and the lowest total number of births seen in 32 years. The fertility rate among women also reached a new record low.The provisional report comes courtesy of the National Center for Health Statistics. Based on birth certificate data collected from all 50 states, it estimated there were 3,788,235 births in 2018 (the records from some states weren’t 100 percent collected so there’s some guessing involved). That’s a step down from 2017. And the national birthrate, measured as the number of births per every 1,000 women between the ages of 15 to 44, also took a drop for the fourth year in a row. Overall, the country hasn’t seen this few births since 1986.This decline, to be clear, isn’t entirely a bad thing. As has been the case for years now, teen pregnancies are continuing to become less common, with a 7 percent decrease last year from 2017. While this decrease has been mostly steady since the early 1990s, there was a period around the mid-2000s when teen pregnancies began climbing again (not-so-coincidentally, perhaps, that’s also when abstinence -only sex education programs were heavily subsidized by the Bush White House). Some of the downturn in births can also be attributed to women or couples in their 20s simply content to hold off on having children for the time being.But there are likely other worrying things that are making pregnancies among women in their 20s less common, namely the lingering after-effects of the Great Recession. Research has consistently linked a struggling economy to fewer births, and in the U.S., this latest decline began in 2008, when the recession hit.While some people’s financial fortunes (mostly the rich) have since recovered and the economy as a whole is considered healthy, it’s people in their 20s who are often still struggling to stay afloat. And this financial stranglehold is clearly affecting some young adults’ plans for parenthood. A 2018 survey commissioned by the New York Times, for instance, found that nearly two-thirds of adults cited the expenses of child care as a reason for not having children. In fact, it was the most commonly-cited reason.There’s also been a continuing decline in the fertility rate, defined as the number of children a woman has over her lifetime. In 2018, the rate was 1.72 births per every woman, a decline from 1.76 births in 2017. Experts consider a rate of 2.1 births to be a baseline for ensuring that younger generations can continue to replace the aging population with no problems, a threshold the U.S. has consistently failed to meet for a decade.Again, as with the birth rate, this isn’t necessarily a doomsday scenario. Many similarly wealthy countries, such as Canada, have rates even lower than that. In some ways, a lower fertility rate could be viewed as a sign that an industrialized country is doing relatively well. It can mean, as mentioned above, that more women have the reproductive freedom to have (or not have) children at their choosing. The closer the birth rate becomes to that of countries like Greece and Japan, though, the more trouble that could spell in the future, with a growing aging population that can strain a country’s resources and labor shortages.In short, nothing but bright things to look forward to.

CVS Health CEO Larry Merlo and Aetna Chairman and CEO Mark Bertolini spoke on CNBC's ""Squawk Box "" Monday, one day after announcing that CVS will acquire Aetna for roughly $69 billion in cash and stock. The deal would combine CVS' pharmacy business and pharmacy benefit manager platform, also referred to as a PBM, with Aetna's insurance business. Upon closing, ""they'll be things we'll be able to do out of the gate,"" Merlo told CNBC. ""Over the next couple of years, you'll see a dramatic change in terms of the store not just being about products but also service offerings that can help people on their path to better health."" CVS plans to run Aetna as a separate business unit. Bertolini will be on the combined company's board but won't be in charge of Aetna unit. The CEOs say they've had a business relationship since 2010. Merlo said he and Bertolini wanted to create a health-care platform that's ""easier to use and less expensive for users."" ""It's really the perfect time,"" he said. ""We have the ability to begin to bend that cost curve and at the same time help people achieve their best health."" The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2018, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. ""We'll look forward to sitting down with the regulators, talking about how this comes to life in a meaningful way,"" Merlo said. The deal marks a change in strategy for Aetna. Earlier this year, Aetna's $37 billion plan to acquire smaller health insurance company Humana was blocked by a federal judge over antitrust concerns. When asked whether they're concerned about regulators regarding their deal, the CEOs told CNBC they believe ""the transaction is highly complementary."" The deal also comes as online retail giant Amazon has the potential to enter the drug industry and has held preliminary talks with makers of generic drugs.

NASA says its astronomers may have spotted water vapor plumes erupting on the surface of Jupiter's moon Europa.  Europa, which is about the size of earth's moon, is thought to be one of the most promising places to look for life in our solar system -- besides Earth. Using the Hubble Telescope, astronomers spotted plumes that are estimated to rise about 125 miles (200 kilometers) and then rain the material back down onto Europa's surface. ""Europa's ocean is considered to be one of the most promising places that could potentially harbor life in the solar system,"" said Geoff Yoder, acting associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington.  ""These plumes, if they do indeed exist, may provide another way to sample Europa's subsurface."" Europa has an enormous ocean containing twice as much water as Earth's oceans, but it's located under a layer of hard ice of unknown thickness.  Scientists hope that the plumes will allow them to gather water samples of the water without drilling through the ice.  If the findings are confirmed, Europa would be the second moon in the solar system known to spew water plumes. NASA spotted ""jets of water vapor and dust"" off the surface of Saturn's moon Enceladus in 2005. NASA says it hopes the infrared version of its new James Webb Space Telescope, which is expected to launch in 2018, to confirm the water plume finding on Europa.

The European Union wants the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is a one-stop shop for approving and monitoring the safety of drugs across Europe, to leave London after Brexit. The health ministry plans to hire 40 staff this year to reinforce the 493 employees who monitor medicines in Spain, it said. More staff would also allow Barcelona to better compete as one of 19 European cities that have lodged official applications to host the EMA, the ministry added. Spain’s decision to boost staff at a national level comes after the European agency initiated a business continuity plan earlier this month to deal with the uncertainty and workload implications linked to Britain’s withdrawal from the EU. The European Commission will assess the European city candidates to host the EMA by September but the final decision rests with EU leaders who will try to reach a consensus deal at their next summit in October. The winner is expected to be announced the following month. The EMA is a prized asset for the host country, employing nearly 900 staff with an annual budget of $360 million. It attracts 36,000 experts a year to London for meetings.

2019-06-03 22:19:58,2019,6.0,3,"F.D.A. Can Act Against Stem Cell Clinic, Judge Rules","A Florida judge says the agency is entitled to an injunction against a stem cell clinic that has blinded patients and challenged the government’s authority to regulate it. A federal judge on Monday struck a blow against the rapidly growing stem cell industry, ruling for the Food and Drug Administration in its efforts to halt treatments by U.S. Stem Cell, a clinic in Sunrise, Fla., that blinded three patients by injecting a fat extract into their eyes. The decision does not shut down the clinic but states that the F.D.A. has the authority to regulate it and is entitled to an injunction against it. The judge, Ursula Ungaro of United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, is expected to issue a further ruling shortly that will specify what action can be taken against the clinic. U.S. Stem Cell performs liposuction on patients to suck out belly fat, processes the fat to extract what it describes as stem cells and then injects the extract back into patients. It has claimed that the process can treat neurological, autoimmune, orthopedic and degenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as A.L.S. or Lou Gehrig’s disease), lung disease, heart disease, back trouble, arthritis and other problems. The clinic is one of hundreds of loosely regulated stem-cell businesses that have sprung up around the country, offering to treat an array of ailments. Some use cells from fat, some use the patient’s own bone marrow or platelets, and some use cord blood or other birth tissue like amniotic membranes. The industry has grown so fast that the F.D.A. has barely been able to keep up. The agency has focused its efforts on so-called bad actors that have harmed patients or were found to be performing risky procedures that were quite likely to injure someone. The F.D.A. requested a permanent injunction against U.S. Stem Cell in May 2018, seeking to stop it from marketing stem cell products without F.D.A. approval. The patients who went blind received the injections in 2015, and their cases gained public attention in 2017. Monday’s court ruling does not mention those cases, but it states that multiple inspections had found that the company violated rules for good manufacturing practices and failed to improve even after warnings. The company and its chief scientific officer, Kristin Comella, argued that because it was treating patients with their own cells, the F.D.A. did not have regulatory authority. The agency disagreed, arguing that the cells were heavily processed and altered from their natural state, making them similar to drugs, which the F.D.A. does regulate. The judge sided with the F.D.A. In an emailed statement, U.S. Stem Cell said it was “disappointed” with the court ruling but would immediately stop performing the procedure in question. “While we believe there is substantial evidence to prove the efficacy of this protocol, we must immediately comply with the court as we review the decision,“ the company statement continued. “US Stem Cell Inc and US Stem Cell Clinic will continue to operate business as usual, but will no longer offer the adipose/SVF procedure.” “We’ve been taking action, like this case, against clinics that abuse the trust of patients and endanger their health,” an F.D.A. spokeswoman, Stephanie Caccomo, said in a statement. “We will continue to promote the sound and scientific development of regenerative medicine products, but we will not tolerate those in this field who try to skirt the law and put patients in harm’s way.” Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who was F.D.A. director when the agency sought the injunction, called the ruling very important and said it provided “a firm legal basis for the F.D.A. to step in and take much more robust action.” He added, “It sends a strong message to people straddling the line that they can’t cross it.” In her ruling, Judge Ungaro stated, “The Court agrees with the F.D.A. that there is a reasonable likelihood that the Defendants will continue to violate the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.” The F.D.A. has also requested a permanent injunction against another stem cell business, Cell Surgical Network, which is based in Beverly Hills, Calif., and has dozens of affiliates around the country. That case is pending.

While the scramble reflects a strong appetite for listings on Shanghai’s Nasdaq-style STAR Market, which was launched in June, it also underlines the challenge for bankers to value IPOs for tech start-ups as regulators let market prices play their role in setting prices. Chipscreen (688321.SS), which develops original drugs for tumors and diabetes, said in an exchange filing on Thursday that shares reserved for individual investors - accounting for about one fifth of the IPO - were 2,956.25 times oversubscribed. The company has set the price for its initial public offering (IPO) at 20.43 yuan per share, or 467.51 times 2018 earnings, the highest so far for a STAR Market company. In contrast, China-listed pharmaceutical firms, traded at an average earnings multiple of 30.79 over the past month. The feverish demand values Chipscreen at 8.38 billion yuan ($1.21 billion), and would allow the company to raise 1 billion yuan - 27% more than originally planned. In a roadshow on Tuesday, Chipscreen founder Lu Xianping said the company will use the IPO proceeds to “strengthen competitiveness, expand market share, and develop new products in a bid to make growth sustainable”. Chipscreen’s share offering came a week after the frenzied debut of the first batch of 25 companies on the science and technology board on July 22. The companies surged roughly 140% on average on that day. Chipscreen has not disclosed when it will debut on the STAR Market, which has attracted a slew of Chinese drugmakers to list. One drug developer, Suzhou Zelgen Biopharmaceuticals Co, plans to list before it sells any products to patients, potentially testing investors’ risk tolerance. The new tech board potentially competes with Hong Kong, which last year revised listing rules to allow so-called pre-revenue, or pre-profit biotech firms to go public in the city. Under the new listing regime, 10 biotech firms have floated in Hong Kong as of May, raising over HK$33 billion ($4 billion). Shares of Ascletis Pharma (1672.HK), the first biotech firm to list in Hong Kong under the new rules, are trading about 66% below is IPO price, while performances of the rest are mixed.

There are currently no approved treatments, or preventive vaccines for COVID-19, the highly contagious, sometimes deadly respiratory illness caused by coronavirus. Researchers are studying existing treatments and working on experimental ones, but most current patients receive only supportive care such as breathing assistance. Hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug, is among the medications undergoing testing as a potential treatment for patients with the disease. Earlier this week, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), which maintains a list of drug shortages, said there was a shortage of hydroxychloroquine. “Chloroquine has demonstrated toxicity in certain patients,” Dinesh Dua, chairman of the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India, told Reuters. “You have to tread with caution because there is no comprehensive data to prove it works.” The group said India, the world’s largest supplier of generic drugs, was not short of the drug but that companies were acutely short of staff to run operations. Cadila Healthcare Ltd, part of the Zydus group and one of India’s top makers of the drug, said it was ramping up production to about 200 million pills a month. “The priority is to work with the government in these challenging times and do all that we can in combating the coronavirus,” a spokesman said. Earlier on Wednesday, Cadila Healthcare’s stock fell more than 5% after the export ban was announced. Late on Tuesday, India ordered a 21-day lockdown of its 1.3 billion people to try to protect the world’s second most populous country from the fast-spreading coronavirus. “It is impossible to maintain operations due to lockdown, because employees don’t want to come (to work),” Dua said. India has already banned the export of ventilators, sanitizers and personal protection equipment such as masks and clothing used in the fight against the virus, which has so far infected more than 500 people and killed nine in the country. The ban came after India this month curbed the export of 26 pharmaceutical ingredients and the medicines made from them, including Paracetamol - a common pain reliever also sold as acetaminophen - as the coronavirus outbreak plays havoc with supply chains. Some of those restrictions have since been relaxed. For an interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus: open tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7 in an external browser.

2017-02-24 00:00:00,2017,2.0,24,"Dolly the sheep: 20 years on, questions remain over cloning"," (CNN)On February 22, 1997, the world learned about a secret project that scientists at the Roslin Institute in Scotland had been working on. More than seven months earlier, on July 5, 1996, they had aided a Scottish Blackface sheep in giving birth to a Finn Dorset lamb codenamed 6LL3.  She was the first mammal to ever be cloned from the cells of an adult animal.    Using a breakthrough technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer, scientists at Roslin took a nucleus -- the part of the cell that contains most of its genetic information -- from cells within the mammary gland of an adult sheep and stuck it inside an unfertilized egg from which the nucleus had been removed.    They stimulated the egg to develop into an embryo and planted the embryo into a surrogate mother. The lamb was dubbed Dolly, a nod to country music legend Dolly Parton and her famously ample bosom. Years later, that same cell cluster was used to make four other sheep just like Dolly.   Revealing Dolly The lab had kept her birth secret for seven months to make the announcement coincide with the publication of the scientific paper describing the experiments that produced her, they said.   That week, they recall, they received 3,000 phone calls from all over the world, according to the Roslin Institute. Much of the news reports had focused not on cloning sheep but on its potential for humans, said Alan Colman, who is now a visiting scholar in the Harvard University Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology. At the time, Colman was research director at PPL Therapeutics, which specialized in producing transgenic (genetically engineered) livestock.  ""We'd underestimated the impact the announcement would make,"" he said. ""It was something we had prepared for, but we had been totally overwhelmed by the response."" Dolly's legacy Previously, cloning had been done using only embryonic cells, and now researchers had showed that it was possible in cells from another part of the body -- an adult body. ""At the time she was born, I was ecstatic, because no one had previously been able to use nuclear transfer to make an adult vertebrate from an adult cell,"" Colman said. Despite the headlines, cloning a mammal wasn't the team's main goal. They were out to develop a more efficient way to produce genetically modified livestock. In fact, Dolly wasn't even the first to ever be cloned.  She was the first mammal cloned from an adult cell. But scientists have learned a lot since developing the technique, and somatic cell nuclear transfer has been used in more than 20 species to make clones.   The Roslin Institute explained that people have long been motivated to try cloning to make copies of the very best animals for agricultural purposes.  Also, since the mid-1980s, there has been an interest in making new uses for farm animals, including producing human proteins in the milk of transgenic cows or sheep for medicinal use in humans.  South Korea's Sooam Biotech Research Foundation have even cloned dogs.    But by and large, scientists don't see a need to clone humans. Instead, they are using what they learned from creating Dolly to make advancements in stem cell therapy, such as to create embryonic stem cells directly from a patient's own cells.  They can then study the progression of whichever disease the patient has. Concerns Dolly herself lived out her days at the Roslin Institute and was able to produce six lambs.   But she was euthanized at age 6 after being diagnosed with progressive lung disease and after a long battle with arthritis. Finn Dorset sheep usually live 10 to 11 years, and her health problems seemed to confirm fears that cloned animals would age faster and die prematurely compared with animals born naturally. This was further exemplified by Dolly's four cloned ""sisters,"" who were recently euthanized because they too began to show symptoms of osteoarthritis.  ""OA, as you may know, is a progressive disease, and we took appropriate measures to manage the condition at the time under veterinary guidance,"" said Kevin Sinclair, a developmental biologist at the University of Nottingham who led research on the sheep.  ""These animals were in their 10th year and so coming towards the end of their natural lifespan."" A recent study of the remaining clones, however, found that they aged the same as naturally born sheep. To investigate this further, the team at Nottingham will now conduct postmortem examinations to truly understand what's going on inside the animals.  ""The final phase of our study ... involves detailed postmortem analyses of different tissues and organs in order to gain a better insight into the aging process in these animals,"" Sinclair said.    The Roslin Institute donated Dolly's body to the National Museum of Scotland, where she stands to this day.

2017-03-15 00:00:00,2017,3.0,15,New UK drug cost rules leave companies fuming,"LONDON (Reuters) - British drugmakers on Wednesday accused Theresa May’s Conservative government of breaking a manifesto commitment to improve access to new medicines, following approval of new cost rules that take effect on April 1. The angry response from both Big Pharma and biotech firms comes despite a concession by government in the latest version of the scheme, which increases the cost threshold for certain drugs for rare diseases from the previously planned level. Some charities, including the Alzheimer’s Society, also expressed concern that the measures could mean delays for people with serious conditions in getting new treatments. The row comes at a sensitive time for the government, which is about to trigger proceedings to leave the European Union but wants to encourage investment by strategic industries, including the high-tech pharmaceuticals sector. Drug companies are already concerned that Brexit could make Britain a less attractive market, especially if the country ends up outside the current EU-wide system for drug licensing. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which determines the cost-effectiveness of new drugs, and NHS England say their new procedures will fast-track the availability of drugs that offer exceptional value. But drug industry executives believe few, if any, new medicines will actually benefit from this provision and the overall impact of the changes will be outweighed by newly introduced budget curbs. “Today’s proposals from NICE/NHS England break the Conservative Party’s 2015 manifesto promise to speed up the introduction of cost-effective medicines into the NHS,” said Mike Thompson, CEO of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. The new system means that new drugs costing the National Health Service (NHS) more than 20 million pounds ($24 million) a year will no longer be automatically funded, even if they are cost-effective. Instead, companies will have to enter negotiations to justify their use and work out funding. Alzheimer’s Society CEO Jeremy Hughes said any new drug to help all 850,000 people with dementia in Britain would have to cost just 23.50 pounds a year to fit the threshold. Similar limitations will apply to drugs for very rare diseases that cost more than 300,000 pounds for each year of high quality life delivered. Previously, the proposed a cap for rare diseases had been 100,000 pounds but NICE CEO Andrew Dillon said the authorities had revised the plan after listening to feedback. Even at the higher level, drugmakers argue the introduction of cost caps for medicines treating a handful of patients would be damaging and could threaten the flow of new medicines. Significantly, the new rules apply only to England, leaving a different system in place for Scotland. “They will build a Hadrian’s Wall for English patients who will no longer be able to access innovative new treatments that will continue to be available in Scotland,” said Steve Bates, CEO of the BioIndustry Association.

2018-10-08 00:00:00,2018,10.0,8,Sleep deprivation could be as risky for drivers as alcohol,"(Reuters Health) - Drivers who hit the road on less than four hours of sleep are at least as likely to be involved in a crash as drivers who had too much to drink, a U.S. study suggests. Brian Tefft, senior researcher at the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety in Washington, D.C., reviewed data on more than 6,800 road accidents between 2005 and 2007 to study the effects of sleep deprivation on driving. “We really wanted to quantify” the relationship between how sleep-deprived a driver is, and “how much it affects their crash risk,” Tefft told Reuters Health by phone. As part of an earlier study, the drivers in these accidents had all been interviewed in depth by investigators from the U.S. Department of Transportation. Tefft classified the drivers into those who were “culpable” for a crash and those who weren’t. Drivers whose errors, actions, or lack of actions, led to a crash were deemed culpable, whereas those involved in crashes caused by external factors, such as brake failure or poor infrastructure, were not. His findings showed that people who drove after getting less than seven hours of sleep were at higher risk for being culpable for the crash. That risk was greatest for drivers who slept less than four hours. “The sharp increase in risk below four hours stands out,” the University of Pittsburgh’s Dr. Sanjay Patel, who was not involved in the study, told Reuters Health in an email. “The odds of being responsible for a crash go up from 2.9-fold to 15.1-fold as sleep drops from four to five hours to less than 4 hours. But that . . . is not surprising given what we know about how decreasing sleep affects other aspects of brain function,” Patel said. Drivers who reported having slept for less than four hours had “crash risks” similar to what’s been documented in drivers with blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) of 0.12 g/dL, Tefft notes in his report. In the U.S., driving with a BAC of 0.08 g/dL or higher is illegal, with lower limits for commercial drivers. Most of Western Europe and Japan have stricter limits. One weakness of the study is that it relied on drivers themselves to report how much they had slept. Another potential weakness is that other factors, like the presence of a sleep disorder, could contribute to crash risk. Also, Patel pointed out, “Drivers deemed non-culpable may still have been partially responsible for the crash - they (may have been) slow in veering out of the way of the culpable driver, for example.” Overall, 78 percent of non-culpable drivers and 70 percent of culpable drivers reported having slept for seven to nine hours in the 24 hours before crashing, Tefft reported in the journal Sleep. The study also found that drivers who had recently changed their sleep or work schedule had about a 30 percent increase in their risk of causing a crash. “(This shows that) independently of the effect of sleep deprivation, disruption in the body’s internal clock can also increase one’s risk of causing a crash,” Tefft said. Drivers who spent less than four hours asleep in a 24-hour period are also at a significantly greater risk of being culpable in a single-vehicle crash than in one that involves another vehicle, the study showed. Single-vehicle crashes are more than three times as likely as multiple-vehicle crashes to result in fatalities, Tefft said. Data from the National Sleep Foundation show 60 percent of U.S. adults have driven while feeling drowsy and around 33 percent have actually fallen asleep at the wheel. Benjamin McManus, a researcher in the Translational Research and Injury Prevention Laboratory at The University of Alabama at Birmingham, says Tefft’s study indicates sleep-deprived crashes aren’t all cases of “nodding off” or being “asleep-at-the-wheel.” “Judgment and decision making are highly impacted by poor sleep quantity and quality,” McManus said in an email. “With changes in the work economy and growth of ridesharing, we’re seeing a growth of a “gig” economy where many work from home, work irregular hours, or work multiple jobs. (Data like this) may make the difference between recommendations of ‘you need a cup of coffee’ versus ‘you need a nap.’” SOURCE: bit.ly/2QENPYn Sleep, online September 18, 2018.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-drivers-sleep-deprivation/sleep-deprivation-could-be-as-risky-for-drivers-as-alcohol-idUSKCN1MI1O7,Health News,Reuters,health,705
2018-06-02 00:00:00,2018,6.0,2,Grail blood test shows promise in early detection of lung cancer,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - An experimental blood screening test from Grail Inc showed early promise in detecting early-stage lung cancers based on free-floating DNA released by tumors, according to preliminary results released on Saturday. The findings, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in Chicago, were based on a sample of 127 lung cancer patients and 580 healthy people. The findings represent a first look how a blood test for early-stage cancer would do at detecting lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death in the United States often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Grail’s lung cancer data comes from a wider study that eventually aims to enroll 15,000 participants and cover 20 different types of cancers. Grail, a Silicon Valley spinoff of sequencing company Illumina Inc, merged last year with Hong Kong-based Cirina Ltd, a private company focused on early cancer detection. “What we’re generally seeing is a strong blood-based biological signal for cancers that have a high mortality and are typically not screened for,” Dr. Anne-Renee Hartman, vice president of clinical development at Grail, said in a telephone interview. The research studied the ability of three different prototype sequencing tests to detect cancer in blood samples from people with early to advanced lung cancers. All three tests identified lung cancers with a low rate of false positives. But they did a better job of detecting later-stage cancers, which shed more DNA fragments, than early-stage cancers, the company’s ultimate goal. One of the tests, which used sequencing to detect non-hereditary mutations, performed the best. It detected 51 percent of early-stage cancers and 89 percent of late-stage cancers. Researchers also found that more than half of patients in the study had mutations in their blood that came from white blood cells, and not tumors, requiring them to develop a method to screen those out to prevent false positives. Dr. Geoffrey Oxnard of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who led the study, called the findings “promising early results,” but said the tests need to be validated in a larger group of people. Cirina’s co-founder David Lo was the first scientist to detect free-floating fetal DNA in the blood of a pregnant woman, kicking off the push to use gene sequencing to find fetal abnormalities, and then cancer, in the blood. Since 2016, Grail has raised more than $1.5 billion. Investors include Ally Bridge Group, Hillhouse Capital Group, Sequoia Capital China and WuXi NextCode.

2018-03-16 00:00:00,2018,3.0,16,Spices might get teens to like vegetables,"(Reuters Health) - A dash of cumin or dill might help convince high school students to load up their plate with vegetables during lunchtime in the cafeteria, a small study suggests. Researchers got about 100 high school students in rural Pennsylvania to taste a variety of plain vegetables seasoned with just oil and salt and then try the same vegetables flavored with different spice blends. Participants rated how well they liked each dish and then indicated whether they preferred the plain or spiced up recipe. Students liked broccoli, cauliflower, vegetable dip, and black beans mixed with corn better when recipes included a spice blend, the study found. When forced to choose between plain vegetables and vegetables seasoned with spice blends, students preferred the spicy versions for corn and peas, broccoli, vegetable dip, black beans with corn, and cauliflower, the study also found. “This is important because we really need to make sure we are focusing on improving the vegetables served in schools to make sure students take interest in eating them,” said lead study author Juliana Fritts of Pennsylvania State University in University Park. “Vegetable intake is still SO low in adolescents and adults, and these are so important for health, so we really still need to be working harder at either making vegetables tastier or encouraging people to purchase and eat more vegetables,” Fritts said by email. Teen girls should eat four servings of vegetables a day, and teen boys should eat five, U.S. dietary guidelines recommend. One serving of vegetables could be one cup of leafy greens, a half-cup of cooked or raw veggies, or three-fourths of a cup of vegetable juice. Most students surveyed at the start of the study said the taste, the serving size, and the food’s appearance were “very important” characteristics of school meals. Roughly three in four students said disliking the taste stopped them from eating vegetables. More than half also said they didn’t like the vegetables served in school. Most students were familiar with common spices like cinnamon, garlic powder, black pepper, chili powder, oregano and basil, surveys also found. Very few of them were familiar with cumin, allspice, curry, and sage. The students tasted different vegetables, sometimes plain and other times with added spices, during lunch periods on different school days. Cafeterias served canned or frozen vegetables similar to what they would normally prepare for school lunches. Sensory scientists and research chefs at the McCormick Science Institute, which funded the study, developed the recipes for the experiment. McCormick makes spices sold in grocery stores and to industrial and commercial customers. One limitation of the study is that participation was voluntary, and it’s possible students who agreed to sample different vegetables had different preferences or opinions about veggies than the kids who declined to participate, researchers note in the journal Food Quality and Preference. Another drawback is that researchers didn’t test whether a stronger preference for vegetables with spices translated into teens actually eating more vegetables. Still, the approach tested in the study would be a low-cost and simple strategy to try in school cafeterias because it’s using products that are already staples of school lunch programs, said Gregory Madden, a researcher at Utah State University in Logan. “Increasing the variety of vegetables served can modestly increase consumption,” Madden, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “A more effective strategy is to get rid of competing foods on the plate.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2tXugns Food Quality and Preference, published online February 27, 2018.

Directors Gong Hongjia and Hu Yangzhong had been named as suspects and would cooperate with the investigation by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the firm said in a filing to the stock exchange on Wednesday. It did not provide any detail of the alleged violations. Gong is a Hikvision vice chairman and the firm's largest individual shareholder with a 13.4% stake, according to Refinitiv data. The Forbes China rich list puts his net worth at $9 billion, making him the 26th-richest person in the country. Hu is Hikvision's general manager and is ranked by Forbes as the 265th wealthiest person in China with a net worth of $1.5 billion. Reuters was not immediately able to reach the two directors. The investigation concerned the ""board member individuals"" and not the company, a Hikvision spokeswoman said. Hikvision's share price fell as much as 4.5% in morning trade, while the broader market was up 0.2%. Hikvision, the world's biggest supplier of video surveillance systems, was one of eight firms added to a U.S. blacklist in October aimed at punishing Beijing for its treatment of Muslim minorities in the northwestern region of Xinjiang. The firm had allegedly provided surveillance equipment to police authorities throughout Xinjiang, where China has been accused by Washington of repression, arbitrary detention and high-technology surveillance against Muslim minority groups. Hikvision said at the time that it strongly opposed the U.S. decision and was working on contingency plans. In May, the CSRC said it was working to improve the quality of the country's listed firms after a series of disclosures stoked investor concerns over poor governance.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/14/hikvision-directors-named-in-chinese-securities-regulator-investigation.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,294
2020-03-25 00:00:00,2020,3.0,25,"Coronavirus: Death toll up in Italy, Spain; not as much in Germany","The daily death toll from the coronavirus has increased once again in Italy, after two days of smaller rises, suggesting the worst may not yet be over for the embattled country. In Italy, 743 people died from the virus on Tuesday, according to government data — the highest daily increase since Sunday. The southern European country has been the worst hit by the deadly disease worldwide, experiencing a higher death toll than China, where the virus emerged in late 2019. As of Wednesday morning, a total of 6,820 people have died in Italy due to the pandemic. However, the number of new confirmed cases of coronavirus slowed down for a third consecutive day, according to the Emergency Commissioner and Civil Protection Chief Angelo Borrelli. The total number of infections in the country now stands at 69,176, of which 8,326 people have recovered from the illness. Meanwhile, three Italian trade unions threatening strikes are reportedly close to reaching an agreement with the Italian government, La Stampa reported Wednesday.  Workers in the engineering, chemical, textile and printing industries had said they would go on strike this week. The unions are demanding more stringent measures for the factories that are still open and for bank employees, who they say do not have enough masks, gloves or disinfectant. Spain also recorded a record number of deaths in one day from the virus, with 504 people passing away on Tuesday. Since the pandemic began, a total of 2,991 have died in the second-worst hit country in Europe. There have been 42,058 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Spain, with the country's capital, Madrid, home to the highest number of infections. Given the unprecedented pressure on hospitals, funeral homes and crematoriums around Madrid, an ice rink in the city has been transformed into a temporary morgue. Palacio de Hielo, as it is known, received the first coffins on Monday. The freezing temperatures are expected to protect the bodies until funeral homes have the capacity to bury or cremate them. Spain has been in national lockdown since mid-March and the restrictions on movement and gatherings of people — just like in other European countries — is preventing family members from attending funerals. Salvador Illa Roca, Spain's health minister, said Tuesday that the government had stepped up its efforts to buy ventilators and sped up national production of the most essential products in the fight against the virus. Meanwhile, Germany registered 28 coronavirus deaths on Tuesday and 114 in total since the pandemic began. The figures are substantially lower than in other European countries, even though Germany has one of the highest number of confirmed cases at 32,991. The highest number of infections in Germany has occurred in the 15-59 age group. The median age for those diagnosed with coronavirus in Germany is 47 years — below what's considered the riskiest age group.",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/coronavirus-death-toll-up-in-italy-spain-not-as-much-in-germany.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,474

The group is combining Bluetooth’s existing object-tracking tech with another technology, radio direction, in order to get the precise measurements. This could radically change tracking technology, like Tile’s solution for locating lost objects. Right now, Bluetooth systems track items by measuring their signal strength — but they have a wide accuracy range of one and 10 meters. Now, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group is adding the ability for gadgets to know exactly what direction a signal is coming from, not just its distance, to make that measurement more exact. With this feature turned on, Bluetooth trackers could tell users where an item is down to the centimeter, the group says. That’s great for locating missing gadgets, but it could also be used to improve the accuracy of tracking in indoor spaces where Bluetooth beacons are used to help people navigate. Generally, if you’re using Bluetooth tracking, it could prove helpful, but I’m also nervous anytime a company can know exactly where I am at any moment.",https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/28/18200995/bluetooth-update-direction-accuracy-location-lost,Tech,The Verge,technology,188
2016-06-09 00:00:00,2016,6.0,9,Women in areas with Zika transmission should delay pregnancy: WHO,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The World Health Organization is advising women living in areas where the Zika virus is being transmitted to delay getting pregnant, advice already given by several countries where the virus is in widespread transmission. The WHO issued the advice last week, but its meaning only became clear on Thursday when the health agency issued a correction to its advice on preventing sexual transmission of the virus. Although Zika is primarily spread by mosquitoes, it can also be spread through sexual transmission. In women who are pregnant, this exposes the fetus to the risk of microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size and underdeveloped brains. Concerns over microcephaly led WHO to declare Zika a global health emergency on Feb. 1. WHO’s advice now expressly states that men and women of reproductive age living in affected areas should consider delaying pregnancy. The advice does not say for how long. It will affect men and women in some 60 countries. Several countries affected by the Zika outbreak, including El Salvador, have issued similar warnings to their residents. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not advised women to avoid pregnancy during the Zika outbreak unless they are infected with the virus. So far, Zika is only present in U.S. territories of Puerto Rico American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For these women, the CDC advises them to discuss the risks of Zika with their doctors, and it advises women who do not want to become pregnant to use the most effective means of contraception. In Puerto Rico, U.S. health officials have increased access to intrauterine devices for women seeking to avoid pregnancy. The CDC has advised all pregnant women to avoid travel to areas with active Zika transmission. Zika is not expected to cause large outbreaks in the continental United States. Experts believe it may be several years before a Zika vaccine is widely available.

2020-01-08 00:00:00,2020,1.0,8,Fewer than 100 Seattle students sent home after missing vaccination record deadline," (CNN)Seattle Public Schools sent home fewer than 100 students who arrived for class on Wednesday without complete immunization records. Washington state law requires that students are fully vaccinated, be in the process of completing immunizations or have a signed certificate of exemption in order to attend school, the district said. It had set a Wednesday deadline for students to provide their vaccination information. Sami Hoag, Seattle Public Schools' health services manager, said the district does not yet have an exact number of how many students were sent home. As of Wednesday afternoon, about 500 children in the district had not confirmed their vaccination records, Hoag said, but about 400 have been cleared to attend school because they have confirmed appointments to receive vaccinations. ""There were 520 kids on the list but less than 100 were physically sent home because their parents got the message,"" Hoag said. ""The vast majority of 500 kids now have confirmed appointments to obtain their vaccinations in the next few weeks.""   In August, the district counted 7,000 children without completed immunization records. As of late Tuesday, the total was about 750. After a measles outbreak that led Gov. Jay Inslee to declare a state of emergency, school officials around the state began to crack down on incomplete immunization records and lax record-keeping, Hoag said. ""You could say it was easy-going prior to the outbreak last year,"" Hoag said. ""We need to tighten up and follow the law because of the dangers of measles."" A state law that went into effect last year no longer allows residents to opt out of measles, mumps and rubella vaccination for personal or philosophical reasons, although exemptions for medical or religious reasons are still allowed. Last month, 2,200 students still needed to update their record down from a high of 7,000 in August. The district -- serving more than 50,000 students across 104 schools -- sponsored three free immunization clinics after sending a letter to parents warning that students wouldn't be able to return without complete vaccination records. At least 135 students were immunized at those clinics, school system spokesman Tim Robinson had said. Students can also bring their records up to date at 28 school-based health centers, Hoag added.  Parent Gracie Guzman told CNN affiliate KIRO she made sure her children's vaccines were current right away. ""That's one of the first things within the first week that we moved here, we got all that updated,"" Guzman said. She said she was glad the district and state overall took action on enforcing updated immunization records. ""It's a good thing in a way because we don't want our kids to get sick from other kids that are not vaccinated."" Pon Voatsay told CNN affiliate KOMO his family had just moved from Florida and got a notice from the district a couple weeks ago. ""Disease can be spread among kids -- especially a bunch of kids together in the same place,"" he said. ""I'm concerned about my kids' well-being, so whatever is needed I will get it.""

""I owe it all to Spectre. Spectre showed me that whoever controls the data, controls the future."" The original, real video is from a September 2017 address Zuckerberg gave about Russian election interference on Facebook. The caption of the Instagram post says it's created using CannyAI's video dialogue replacement (VDR) technology. This deepfake of Zuckerberg is one of several made by Canny in collaboration with Posters, including ones of Kim Kardashian and Donald Trump, as part of Spectre, an exhibition that took place as part of the Sheffield Doc Fest in the UK. “We will treat this content the same way we treat all misinformation on Instagram,"" a spokesperson for Instagram told Motherboard. ""If third-party fact-checkers mark it as false, we will filter it from Instagram’s recommendation surfaces like Explore and hashtag pages.” Read more: Inside Facebook’s Struggle to Moderate Two Billion People Following the viral spread of a manipulated Facebook video of House speaker Nancy Pelosi, Facebook has been forced to take a stance on whether fake or altered images are allowed to stay up on the site. Instead of deleting the video, the company chose to de-prioritize it, so that it appeared less frequently in users' feeds, and placed the video alongside third party fact-checker information. At the time, Neil Potts, Facebook’s director of public policy, said that if someone posted a manipulated video of Zuckerberg like the one of Pelosi, it would stay up. Now that there's a deepfake of Zuckerberg implying he's in total control of billions of people's stolen data and ready to control the future, on Facebook-owned Instagram, that stance will be put to the test. Read more: There's No 'Correct' Way to Moderate the Nancy Pelosi Video Canny's founders, Omer Ben-Ami and Jonathan Heimann, told special effects blog FXGuide that their work comes after algorithms developed by University of Washington researchers, which turned audio clips of people speaking into realistic videos of people made to look like they're speaking those words. The UW researchers demonstrated this, at the time, using Barack Obama's face. They said they're also inspired by Stanford's Face2Face program, which enabled real-time facial reenactment. Ben-Ami told Motherboard that to create the fake videos, Canny used a proprietary AI algorithm, trained on 20 to 45 second scenes of the target face for between 12-24 hours. That doesn't seem like much, but we've already seen deepfakes made from as little as one image of a face. For the Zuckerberg deepfake, Canny engineers arbitrarily clipped a 21-second segment out of the original seven minute video, trained the algorithm on this clip as well as videos of the voice actor speaking, and then reconstructed the frames in Zuckerberg's video to match the facial movements of the voice actor. The result is fairly realistic—if you leave the video muted. The voice superimposed on the video is clearly not Zuckerberg, but someone attempting an impression. But this deepfake blinks, moves seamlessly, and gestures like Zuckerberg would. Ben-Ami said that Canny saw this as both an opportunity to educate the public on the uses of AI today, but also to imagine what's next. ""The true potential we see for this tech lies in the ability of creating a photo realistic model of a human being,"" he said. ""For us it is the next step in our digital evolution where eventually each one of us could have a digital copy, a Universal Everlasting human. This will change the way we share and tell stories, remember our loved ones and create content.""

2017-10-27 00:00:00,2017,10.0,27,"Obamacare insurers were on track to break even, analysis says","Obamacare health plans ""were on track to break even or make modest profits"" on average in 2017 before the Trump administration decided this month to end reimbursement payments to insurers, a new report says. The analysis also said prices for Obamacare plans next year likely would have risen by just mid-to-high-single-digit percentage points on average if President Donald Trump had not for months threatened to end those payments, and if Republicans in Congress had not repeatedly tried to repeal much of the Affordable Care Act in 2017. Instead, because of the lack of a ""stable policy environment,"" the average price of the most popular type of Obamacare plan is rising by an average of 34 percent in most of the United States next year, the analysis said. The report also found that the individual health plan market's ""risk pool"" — or mix of customers whose premiums are supposed to more than offset their respective health benefit costs — was not weakened by price hikes for Obamacare plans in 2017. In other words, those premium increases did not ""drive many healthy enrollees from the individual market,"" the analysis found. The report issued Friday was written Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy in the Brookings Institution's Economic Studies Program. Fiedler's research was conducted as part of the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy. It comes less than a week before next Wednesday's start of open enrollment in Obamacare plans. Fiedler, in an interview with CNBC, said his analysis shows that ""after a rocky start, this market was really on a path to stabilize."" He also said that ""it's important for people to understand that what we're seeing here"" with sharply higher premium prices ""is not an inherent feature of this market, but a consequence of a conscious policy choice."" Both points are disputed by the Trump adminstration, which claims that Obamacare has inherent flaws that are leading to high premium prices for consumers, and to insurers exiting individual health plan marketplaces. In an interview Monday with WKYC-TV in Cleveland, Seema Verma, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said, ""There's a lot of problems with the Affordable Care Act that I think are creating barriers for people to get affordable, accessible coverage."" ""We had the same problem last year before the Trump administration came here,"" Verma said. ""If you look at last year, look at the headlines: a number of insurers leaving the marketplace, we saw double-digit increases. That's exactly the same thing that we're having here,"" she said. ""Those problems existed before and that's because the Affordable Care Act's fundamental structure isn't working, so the exact same issues happened last year as well."" But according to his report, Fiedler's analysis ""estimates that insurers were on track to incur small losses averaging 0.4 percent of premium revenue on [Obamacare]-compliant plans in 2017 before the Trump Administration ended cost-sharing reduction payments for the final quarter of the year."" And the report adds there is reason to believe that the data Fiedler analyzed ""may systematically understate insurers' actual financial performance, suggesting that insurers were, in fact, on track to make modest profits"" on Obamacare plans on average nationwide this year. The Trump administration on Oct. 12 said it would no longer pay Obamacare insurers reimbursements for discounts that those insurers offer to low-income customers in their out-of-pocket health costs. Those discounts must continued to be offered by law. But the Trump administration said the reimbursements for their costs to insurers had to be discontinued, because Congress never directly appropriated the money. Because of threats to cut off that money in the past year, many insurers had raised their prices more sharply for 2018 plans than they otherwise would have. A coalition of 18 states and the District of Columbia is suing the administration to compel restoration of the payments, which would be worth an estimated $10 billion to insurers next year. A federal judge in California on Wednesday rejected an emergency request to restore the payments temporarily while that case proceeds.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/26/obamacare-insurers-were-on-track-to-break-even-analysis-says.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,674

2017-08-10 14:00:16,2017,8.0,10,Gene Editing Spurs Hope for Transplanting Pig Organs Into Humans,"In a striking advance that helps open the door to organ transplants from animals, researchers have created gene-edited piglets cleansed of viruses that might cause disease in humans. The experiments, reported on Thursday in the journal Science, may make it possible one day to transplant livers, hearts and other organs from pigs into humans, a hope that experts had all but given up. If pig organs were shown to be safe and effective, “they could be a real game changer,” said Dr. David Klassen, chief medical officer at the United Network for Organ Sharing, a private, nonprofit organization that manages the nation’s transplant system. There were 33,600 organ transplants last year, and 116,800 patients on waiting lists, according to Dr. Klassen, who was not involved in the new study. “There’s a big gap between organ supply and organ demand,” he said. Dr. George Church, a geneticist at Harvard who led the experiments, said the first pig-to-human transplants could occur within two years. The new research combines two great achievements in recent years — gene editing and cloning — and is unfolding quickly. But the work is novel and its course unpredictable, Dr. Klassen noted. It may be years before enough is known about the safety of pig organ transplants to allow them to be used widely. The idea of using pigs as organ factories has tantalized investigators for decades. Porcine organs can be the right size for human transplantation, and in theory, similar enough to function in patients. But the prospect also raises thorny questions about animal exploitation and welfare. Already an estimated 100 million pigs are killed in the United States each year for food. Scientists pursuing this goal argue that the few thousand pigs grown for their organs would represent just a small fraction of that total, and that they would be used to save human lives. The animals would be anesthetized and killed humanely. Major religious groups have already weighed in, generally concluding that pig organs are acceptable for lifesaving transplants, noted Dr. Jay Fishman, co-director of the transplant program at Massachusetts General Hospital. Pig heart valves already are routinely transplanted into patients. (A survey in the 1990s by Dr. Fishman and his colleagues found that some leaders in the Jewish and Muslim communities did not endorse pig kidneys for transplant, , reasoning that patients with kidney failure can survive with dialysis.) Scientists began pursuing the idea of pig organs for transplant in the 1990s. But in 1998, Dr. Fishman and his colleagues discovered that hidden in pig DNA were genes for viruses that resembled those causing leukemia in monkeys. When researchers grew pig cells next to human embryonic kidney cells in the laboratory, these viruses — known as retroviruses — spread to the human cells. Once infected, the human cells were able to infect other human cells. Fears that pig organs would infect humans with bizarre retroviruses brought the research to a halt. But it was never clear how great this threat really was, and as years have gone by, many experts, including Dr. Fishman, have become less concerned. Some patients with diabetes have received pig pancreas cells, hidden in a sort of sheath so the immune system will not reject them. And burn patients sometimes get grafts made of pig skin. The pig skin is eventually rejected by the body, but it was never meant to be permanent anyway. A new technique known as Crispr has revolutionized humans’ ability to edit DNA. See if you can identify whether a given development has already happened, could eventually happen or is pure fiction. There is no evidence that any of these patients were infected with porcine retroviruses. In any event, said Dr. A. Joseph Tector, a transplant surgeon at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, pig retroviruses are very sensitive to the drugs used to treat H.I.V. “We don’t know that if we transplant pig organs with the viruses that they will transmit infections, and we don’t know that the infections are dangerous,” Dr. Fishman said. “I think the risk to society is very low.” Dr. Church and his colleagues thought the retrovirus question could be resolved with Crispr, the new gene-editing technology. They took cells from pigs and snipped the viral DNA from their genomes. Then the scientists cloned the edited cells. Each pig cell was brought back to its earliest developmental stage and then slipped into an egg, giving it the genetic material to allow the egg to develop into an embryo. The embryos were implanted in sows and grew into piglets that were genetically identical to the pig that supplied the initial cell. Cloning often fails; most of the embryos and fetuses died before birth, and some piglets died soon after they were born. But Dr. Church and his colleagues ended up with 15 living piglets, the oldest now 4 months old. None have the retroviruses. Dr. Church founded a company, eGenesis, in hopes of selling the genetically altered pig organs. Eventually, Dr. Church says, the company wants to engineer pigs with organs so compatible with humans that patients will not need to take anti-rejection drugs. Dr. David Sachs, a professor of surgery at Columbia University, was skeptical that it would be straightforward to make pigs with such compatible organs. “I am afraid that he may find these goals more difficult to achieve than he expects, but I would be happy to be mistaken,” said Dr. Sachs, who is also studying ways to create pigs suitable for organ donation. Part of the organ rejection problem is already being solved with gene editing and cloning. It is an issue that emerged in the early 1980s when surgeons put a pig heart into a baboon. To their shock, the baboon died in minutes. Researchers soon discovered that pig organs are covered with carbohydrate molecules that mark the organs for immediate destruction by human antibodies. Dr. David Cooper, at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and his colleagues, including Dr. Tector, have used gene editing and cloning to make pigs without the carbohydrates on the surfaces of their organs. They successfully transplanted hearts and kidneys from those pigs into monkeys and baboons. So far, the animals have lived more than a year with no problems, Dr. Tector said. They also gave insulin-producing islet cells from a pig to diabetic monkeys, and the monkeys lived for a year without requiring insulin. In partnership with United Therapeutics, the group has already built a farm for gene-edited pigs. Dr. Church says he, too, is making pigs whose organs lack the carbohydrates, and he wants to combine the two advances so the organs also do not have retroviruses. The Alabama group, though, does not think pig retroviruses are a major concern. Surgeons are used to evaluating the risks of infection from transplanted organs, Dr. Tector said. The advantage of the transplant to the desperately ill recipient often outweighs that risk. To some, the idea of growing pigs to create organs is distasteful. Many patients may prefer a human organ, Dr. Cooper acknowledged, but that is not always possible. “About 22 people a day die waiting for a transplant,” he said. “If you could help them with a pig organ, wouldn’t that be wonderful?”",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/health/gene-editing-pigs-organ-transplants.html,health,The New York Times,health,1202
2019-05-06 00:00:00,2019,5.0,6,Exclusive: Sequoia China to cut up to 20 percent of investment staff as tech growth slows - sources,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Sequoia Capital China, widely viewed as a bellwether for Chinese tech investment, is set to lay off as much as 20 percent of its investment staff as a slowdown in the country’s tech sector saps appetite for risk, said two people with knowledge of the matter.  The Chinese arm of Silicon Valley venture capitalist Sequoia Capital is looking to cut the number of venture investment professionals from about 70, the people said. Two other people said the cut would be at least 10 percent.  Sequoia China told Reuters in a statement sent ahead of story publication that it regularly reviews its workforce which may result in personnel adjustments.  “Within the last 12 months, we had 13 new investment professionals join Sequoia China, which slightly increased our total number of employees,” it said in the statement.   In a later statement to Reuters after the story was published, a spokeswoman said the story was untrue.   The layoffs would come after a government campaign against debt financing left start-ups vying for shrinking pools of fresh capital. Meanwhile disappointing returns from firms going public amid market volatility has made investors bearish, resulting in down rounds - where a firm’s valuation in a round of fundraising falls below that of a previous round.  Chinese venture capital and private equity managers raised a combined $1.5 billion for investment across all sectors in the first three months of 2019, a far cry from the $9.4 billion of the same period last year, according to data provider Preqin.  Reflecting broader industry malaise, major tech firms have cut headcount and salaries to maintain performance as economic slowdown and Sino-U.S. trade war weigh on customer sentiment, while at the same time seeking opportunities as growth plateaus.  Sequoia China’s job cuts began in late March and have mainly affected the venture capital arm’s technology & media, healthcare, consumer and industrial technology teams, two of the people told Reuters, declining to be identified as the information was not yet public.  Investment professionals including one partner, one managing director, and several vice presidents and associates have agreed to leave the firm during these cuts, said one of the people.  The cuts mirror similar moves across the much-hyped tech industry in the world’s second-biggest economy.   In February, ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing said it would axe 15 percent of staff, mostly in non-core business units.  The same month, online media outlet Sina Tech said e-commerce firm JD.com Inc planned to lay off 10 percent of senior executives this year. In March, Bloomberg said gaming and social media leader Tencent Holdings Ltd planned to demote or axe about 10 percent of managers.  Neither JD.com nor Tencent responded to Reuters’ requests for comment.  Sequoia China was founded in 2005 by entrepreneur-turned-investor Neil Shen. The firm employs about 150 people at offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and elsewhere in China.  It has invested in over 500 firms in China, including JD.com and bigger rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, as well as some of China’s fastest-growing firms such as Didi Chuxing, Meituan Dianping and Beijing Bytedance Technology.  It is widely known for expertise in venture capital-type deals, but has been broadening its focus to even earlier-stage seed investment as well as far later-stage funding ahead of initial public offerings.  Last year it raised its first seed fund of $150 million and its fifth growth fund of $1.8 billion, the largest of its kind, showed Preqin data.  Its relatively young seed- and late-stage investment teams have been less affected by the layoffs so far, said two of the people. One of the people said there would be job cuts in the one-year-old seed team in the coming months.

2016-09-23 00:00:00,2016,9.0,23,People who improve their diets reduce diabetes risk,"(Reuters Health) – Adopting a healthier diet may lower type 2 diabetes risk over time, while a worsening diet is often accompanied by increased risk, according to a new U.S. study. “Although recent public health recommendations have increasingly focused on advocating overall diet quality improvement, evidence has been limited on whether changing overall diet in adulthood has a long-term preventative impact on diabetes prevention in general population,” said lead author Sylvia H. Ley of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. “We provide evidence that improving diet quality in adulthood is associated with type 2 diabetes prevention, while worsening diet quality is associated increased risk for diabetes,” she said by email. The researchers analyzed data on more than 124,000 adults who did not have diabetes at the start of three large, long-term studies of lifestyle and health outcomes and who were observed for at least 20 years. Participants rated their diet quality on a healthy eating index every four years. There were 9,361 cases of type 2 diabetes during the studies. When dietary quality scores declined by more than 10 percent between four-year surveys, diabetes risk went up by about 34 percent, the researchers found. Improving diet quality by the same amount led to a 16 percent decrease in diabetes risk. A “healthier” diet included higher intakes of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, and legumes and lower intakes of red or processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice, trans fat and sodium, as well as moderate alcohol consumption. “Cumulative scientific evidence has supported that improving and maintaining overall quality of healthful diet is beneficial for long-term chronic disease prevention,” Ley said. “Chasing after the latest short-term fix is not likely to offer sustained benefits in the long term.” Improving diet was associated with decreased diabetes risk regardless of how a person ate at the start of the study or how much excess weight they carried. Over time, losing weight explained some, but not all, of the change in diabetes risk, according to the results published in Diabetes Care. “Improving overall diet quality as an adult regardless of where you start, whether you have poor or better initial diet quality, seems to be beneficial for diabetes prevention,” Ley told Reuters Health. “It is known that Western dietary patterns and diets with high glycemic index are associated with a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, whereas the opposite has been observed for prudent dietary patterns and Mediterranean diets,” said Jordi Salas-Salvado of Rovira i Virgili University in Tarragona, Spain, who was not part of the new study. “Three key points to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes are: stay lean, follow a frugal diet and include plenty and large variety of vegetables,” he told Reuters Health by email. Diet quality, as well as body weight, are important for diabetes risk, said Dr. Marc Y. Donath of University Hospital Basel in Switzerland, who also was not part of the new study. “However it remains to be shown how important are qualitative changes in diet compared to calorie restriction,” Donath told Reuters Health by email. “Based on clinical (experience), my impression is that changes in body weight are much more important.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2d0IOFI Diabetes Care, online September 9, 2016.",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-diet-diabetes-idUSKCN11T1MI,Health News,Reuters,health,551

2020-01-24 16:29:00,2020,1.0,24,Joe Rogan’s Endorsement of Bernie Sanders Is One of the Most Influential in America,"Joe Rogan is one of the most influential people in media. That doesn't mean he's a good interviewer or a responsible communicator when speaking to a large and devoted audience, but it is a fact. It's hard to pinpoint the exact size of his podcast's audience, but Rogan’s official YouTube channel has 7.3 million subscribers and he recently claimed his podcast gets 190 million downloads a month. When Elon Musk goes on Rogan’s show and smokes a blunt, Tesla stocks take a tumble (though as Rogan notes at every opportunity, they quickly bounced back). It was a big deal when Bernie Sanders sat down with Rogan for an hour-long interview in August, and an even bigger deal earlier this week when Rogan said that he would probably vote for Sanders in the upcoming election. Sanders is not the first presidential candidate to go on Rogan's podcast—Tulsi Gabbard has been on several times—nor is Sanders the first candidate to get something resembling an endorsement from Rogan. Rogan hosted and voted for Libertarian Gary Johnson in 2016. On Thursday, Sanders tweeted a clip from Rogan's podcast highlighting his endorsement, in which Rogan said he likes Sanders for career-long consistency in his politics. Rogan's endorsement of Sanders is notable because unlike Johnson, Sanders has an actual shot at taking the White House, and in a close race, gaining the support of even a portion of Rogan’s massive, loyal audience could be a difference maker. What’s less clear is why the Sanders campaign embraced and promoted the endorsement, knowing that Rogan is controversial and hated by parts of his base. Rogan’s endorsement is so influential, his audience so large, that it’s not even clear Sanders needed to acknowledge it because Rogan’s audience rivals (and is likely larger than) his own. Who is Sanders reaching with a Joe Rogan video clip that Rogan hasn’t already reached? Rogan's endorsement, and the video Sanders shared on Twitter in particular, has caused some controversy among people who argue that Rogan is a bigot who should be marginalized, ignored, or disavowed. Rogan hasn't wielded his power with much responsibility: He's given people like Chuck Johnson, Milo Yiannopoulos, Alex Jones, Stefan Molyneux, and Gavin McInnes access to his gigantic audience, and Rogan rarely challenges his guests on their views, allowing them to launder their bad ideas on his show. Data & Society researcher Becca Lewis has argued that Rogan giving a platform to these people has led his audience down more extremist rabbit holes on YouTube. Lewis describes Rogan as a ""libertarian influencer with mainstream appeal."" ""When [Rogan] hosts other members of the Intellectual Dark Web, it's easy to get drawn into that world,"" Lewis told Motherboard in 2018. That Rogan is an entry point to other YouTube and podcast influencers speaks to his own influence; whether Rogan's endorsement matters doesn't depend on whether Rogan himself is GOOD or BAD, it's whether his endorsement moves the needle. And given how much discussion there is about his endorsement and what we know about Rogan's overall influence, it almost certainly does. A big part of Rogan's appeal is that he's an average Joe. Sitting down with him for an interview is not the same as doing a quick spot on CNN or Fox News. His interviews are long (often more than three hours), meandering, and silly. It gives subjects the chance to speak at length and often put their foot in their mouth. For his listeners, a recommendation from Rogan is like a recommendation from a friend, if your friend was talking to millions of people at once. It has the appearance of raw, emotional authenticity. It is the exact opposite of a measured, calculated endorsement from the New York Times. What seems to have made lots of people mad, however, is that Sanders has embraced the endorsement. What’s worth noting is that it’s not clear that Sanders sharing the video is actually going to earn him any more voters. Sanders, of course, has a huge audience, but Sanders’ reach is almost certainly smaller than Rogan’s. Sanders’ clip has 3.2 million views on Twitter. Rogan’s audience fluctuates and it’s notoriously difficult to get reliable podcast statistics (especially if you don’t work for that podcast), but if Rogan’s 190 million downloads per month figure is accurate, we could conservatively estimate that each episode is getting far more than 3.2 million downloads. This is why it’s impossible to “amplify” Joe Rogan: He has an audience bigger than nearly anyone in the country, and to ignore that he exists and that people like him is to remove yourself from reality. There’s little danger in Sanders tweeting this video and radicalizing people because Rogan’s audience is already huge. But sharing the video and tacitly accepting Rogan’s endorsement feels like an unforced error, or at least a risk Sanders didn’t need to take: He’s opened himself up to criticism from parts of his base who care about social justice, marginalized people, and stand against the people and ideas Rogan has allowed to be laundered on his show, without really standing to gain anything. ""The goal of our campaign is to build a multi-racial, multi-generational movement that is large enough to defeat Donald Trump and the powerful special interests whose greed and corruption is the root cause of the outrageous inequality in America,"" the Sanders campaign told Motherboard in a statement. ""Sharing a big tent requires including those who do not share every one of our beliefs, while always making clear that we will never compromise our values. The truth is that by standing together in solidarity, we share the values of love and respect that will move us in the direction of a more humane, more equal world.""",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgep94/joe-rogan-bernie-sanders-endorsement,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,951
2018-10-16 17:27:00,2018,10.0,16,"Archeologists Discover ‘Vampire’ Child Who Died 1,500 Years Ago"," A place called the Cemetery of the Babies is bound to be filled with some exceptionally heartbreaking and spooky stuff. But when excavations of this 1,500-year-old children’s necropolis in the Italian commune of Lugnano in Teverina turned up a “vampire burial”—in which a rock had been shoved into a dead child’s mouth—even the professionals were creeped out.   ""I've never seen anything like it. It's extremely eerie and weird,"" excavation team member David Soren, an archeologist at the University of Arizona, said in a statement last week. ""Locally, they're calling it the 'Vampire of Lugnano.'""   The “vampire” belonged to a 10-year-old kid (whose sex is unknown) who probably fell victim to a malaria outbreak that devastated the Umbrian community in the 5th century, said excavation director David Pickel. Analysis of the bones and DNA of local infants laid to rest in the ruins of this cemetery, which is located inside an abandoned 1st century Roman villa, support the hypothesis of a malaria epidemic. The vampire’s skull includes an abscessed tooth, which could have been caused by the illness.  Burials are significant because they “provide a window into ancient minds,” Jordan Wilson, a bioarchaeologist at the University of Arizona who examined the child’s bones, said in a statement.  “We have a saying in bioarchaeology: 'The dead don’t bury themselves.' We can tell a lot about people's beliefs and hopes and by the way they treat the dead,"" Wilson added.  The decision to insert a large rock into the dead child’s mouth was likely motivated by panic and superstition in the community. According to Pickel’s team, this type of burial is associated with a fear of reanimated corpses escaping their graves to spread maladies to the living.   Other examples of the ritual include the “Vampire of Venice,” a 16th century woman who was buried with a brick in her mouth, and the 1,700-year-old remains of a man found in England whose tongue was replaced with a stone.   The vampire child is also special because of his or her age. Since excavations at the Cemetery of the Babies began in the 1980s, all of the 50-odd children discovered there were under three years old, leading experts to assume that the necropolis was intended exclusively for babies and toddlers. The older Vampire of Lugnano challenges that theory.   Other children in the necropolis were buried with items like raven talons, toad bones, and the severed heads of puppies, which suggest that Lugano practised ritual sacrifice and feared the dead, according to Soren. The body of a three-year-old girl was found with stones placed on her hands and feet, perhaps to encourage her to stay put in her grave.

But despite the name, they aren't some sort of horrible conflagration of fire and an actual tornado. Fire whirls happen when hot, dry air close the the ground -- like that near a fire -- rises rapidly in a column, forming a vortex.  This whirl was captured by a firefighter near the Beaver Creek Fire, which is currently raging near Walden, Colorado.  It would be easy to make some sort of ""Eye of Sauron"" joke, because that thing looks positively otherworldly. However, fire tornadoes, though usually brief phenomena, can be extremely dangerous. It's literally a raging column of fire. The Beaver Creek Fire has been burning since June, and is expected to be under control by October.

2019-05-15 08:07:12,2019,5.0,15,Alibaba Reports Slower Growth as U.S.-China Trade War Intensifies,"One of the world’s leading internet giants appears to be feeling the effects of China’s economic slowdown and the trade war with the United States. The Alibaba Group, China’s largest e-commerce company, said on Wednesday that revenue increased by 51 percent in the March quarter from the same period last year. That topped Wall Street’s expectations, and was a pickup from the quarter before. But it was still the company’s second-slowest pace of revenue expansion since early 2016. For the full year that ended March 31, revenue also grew by more than half. The company said, however, that the increase was partly the result of adding several recently acquired businesses, such as the takeout delivery service Ele.me, to its sales computations. Without those, it said, full-year sales would have increased by just under two-fifths, the slowest growth in three years. Alibaba also said the number of customers on its Chinese retail marketplaces for the full year that ended in March had grown to more than 650 million, an increase of over 100 million. China’s economy has slowed since the tariff fight with the United States began last year. Diplomacy with Washington has frayed. Alibaba’s enormous size makes the company a closely watched bellwether for consumer and business sentiment in China, even if it’s an obstacle to finding new ways to make money. Alibaba’s scale and breadth may also put it in a better position than many other Chinese businesses to weather the present choppiness. With services from commerce and food delivery to payments and travel booking now under its umbrella, Alibaba has built such a vast ecosystem of interconnected products and platforms that its hold on Chinese consumers and merchants is almost unassailable, said David Dai, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong. Alibaba is “over all in a much stronger position as compared to any other internet or e-commerce company in China,” Mr. Dai said. During a conference call on Wednesday, the company’s executive vice chairman, Joseph C. Tsai, urged analysts to look beyond what he called “the elephant in the room”: China’s economic confrontation with the United States. More important for Alibaba, Mr. Tsai said, is the long-term increase in consumer spending by China’s middle class. The company would also benefit, he said, if China agreed to import more American goods as part of a trade settlement, because Alibaba is already a partner to global brands that cater to China’s growing ranks of shopaholics. “Those are the more significant drivers of our business, as opposed to quarter-to-quarter G.D.P. or industrial production,” Mr. Tsai said. Yet in a season of high anxiety about the trade war and the global economy, China’s entire tech sector is feeling the pressure. Leading companies have laid off workers. Start-ups, including some that Alibaba has invested in, are struggling. Coders are protesting long hours and unpaid overtime — a sign, industry observers say, that the years of breakneck growth and boundless optimism for Chinese tech companies are past. Alibaba has said it will not lay off any employees this year. But the company has not been immune to strain. On Wednesday, Alibaba’s chief executive, Daniel Zhang, said the company would continue to hold off on charging merchants more to advertise on its shopping sites, despite the harm it would cause to revenue growth. Such ads, along with other services that help merchants reach customers, represent the biggest part of Alibaba’s sales, and nearly all of its profit. Unlike Amazon, Alibaba does not pocket proceeds from merchandise sales on its platforms. It makes money by charging third-party sellers to use its digital shelves and signboards. Alibaba has said it will avoid ramping up ad sales until it has collected more data about whether new personalized ads in its shopping app are successfully persuading customers to hand over more of their money. But Alibaba executives have also said the company does not want to add to its merchants’ expenses at a time when many of them are already jittery about the economy. Instead of trying to make more money by charging more for ads, Mr. Zhang said Wednesday, the company plans to invest in enticing more people, particularly those who live in China’s smaller cities and towns, into conducting their lives within Alibaba’s consumer universe. More than two-thirds of the new users on Alibaba’s Chinese shopping platforms this past year lived outside the country’s megacities, the company said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/technology/alibaba-earnings.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,734
2017-06-06 18:46:00,2017,6.0,6,Major Internet Companies Like Reddit and Mozilla Are Readying a Net Neutrality Protest," Mark your calendars for July 12. That's when a coalition of some of the largest and most influential internet companies on the planet—including Amazon, Reddit, Mozilla, and GitHub—will participate in what's been dubbed an ""Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality."" The online protest, which was announced Tuesday, aims to convince the kind of people who don't spend all day ruminating inside Twitter threads debating the merits of a free and open internet that they do, in fact, have the ability to shape the future policy of the greatest engine of economic growth people have yet devised. ""The Internet has given more people a voice than ever before, and we're not going to let the FCC take that power away from us,"" Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, one of the advocacy groups that organized the July 12 online protest, said in a statement. ""Massive online mobilization got us the strong net neutrality protections that we have now, and we intend to fight tooth and nail to defend them."" What will this online protest entail? According to Fight for the Future, sites like NextDoor, Shapeways, and Patreon will focus on ""grassroots mobilization,"" providing their users with tools so they can easily contact Congress and the FCC to express their support for net neutrality, the principle that all data online be treated equally. More to the point, that means broadband giants like Comcast and Verizon wouldn't be able to prioritize their own in-house services over other services: AT&T wouldn't be able to ensure that DirecTV Now, its streaming video service, loads faster than Netflix, nor would a mom and pop provider be allowed to degrade performance to PornHub simply because the site doesn't align with their moral compass. Serious stuff. ""Net neutrality is essential for creative freedom,"" Colin Sullivan, counsel at Patreon, a crowdfunding site that helps creators fund long-term projects like podcasts, told Motherboard. ""There are over 50,000 creators on Patreon that would suffer if their choice of content distribution channels were limited by anticompetitive pressures. Patreon helps creators get paid, and net neutrality is an important part of that mission."" Former Verizon attorney Ajit Pai, who once famously claimed to want to take a ""weed whacker"" to net neutrality regulations, has claimed that the current regulations are an impediment to continued internet growth and investment, hence his stop-at-nothing crusade to strike them from the books. The FCC itself declined to comment on a Motherboard request for comment about the protest. The ""Day of Action"" evokes memories of a similar online protest that took place in early 2012, when a coalition of online companies drew attention to the Stop Online Piracy Act, a proposed US copyright law that activists claimed would have forced companies like Reddit and Wikipedia to censor their users.

2017-09-11 18:57:23,2017,9.0,11,New Gene-Therapy Treatments Will Carry Whopping Price Tags,"The first gene therapy treatment in the United States was approved recently by the Food and Drug Administration, heralding a new era in medicine that is coming faster than most realize — and that perhaps few can afford. The treatment, Kymriah, made by Novartis, is spectacularly effective against a rare form of leukemia, bringing remissions when all conventional options have failed. It will cost $475,000. With gene therapy, scientists seek to treat or prevent disease by modifying cellular DNA. Many such treatments are in the wings: There are 34 in the final stages of testing necessary for F.D.A. approval, and another 470 in initial clinical trials, according to the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, an advocacy group. The therapies are aimed at extremely rare diseases with few patients; most are meant to cure with a single injection or procedure. But the costs, like that of Kymriah, are expected to be astronomical, alarming medical researchers and economists. One drug, to prevent blindness in those with a rare genetic disease, for example, is expected to cost between $700,000 and $900,000 per patient on average, noted Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, director of the program on regulation, therapeutics and law at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Drug makers argue that the prices ought to reflect the value of a curative treatment to the patient. Dr. Kesselheim and other experts are far from convinced. “We don’t pay the fire department that way,” he said. “When the fire department shows up at a burning house, they don’t ask, ‘How much is it worth to you to put out the fire?’ ” Executives at drug companies declined to say what they plan to charge for the gene therapies they are developing. But they said a variety of factors justified setting unprecedented prices. By definition, there are very few patients with the rare diseases that the treatments target. Companies thus will have comparatively fewer opportunities to make enough money to pay for their investment, to turn a profit and to fund future research. “The reason why it’s a peculiar situation is not only because a lot of these gene therapy products are targeting small populations,” said Matt Kapusta, chief executive of UniQure, which is developing hemophilia treatments. “It is a one-time administration with potentially curative impact for the patient.” Mr. Kapusta also noted that one injection of UniQure’s drug could be expected to replace regular infusions of blood products that can cost $5 million over 10 years. “When you are spending a lot of money to develop therapies for a rare disease, you need to enable a larger price umbrella,” Mr. Kapusta said. “If you are saving $5 million per patient, that gives you a sense of value to the payer.” Jeffrey D. Marrazzo, chief executive of Spark Therapeutics, which is developing the drug to prevent a form of blindness, said it should be worth a lot to keep your eyesight. “We should be compensated for generating that value,” he said. Elizabeth Pingpank, a spokeswoman for Bluebird Bio, which is developing several gene therapies, said the company realizes its prices will be a challenge. Bluebird and several other companies have set up a consortium with academics to try to figure out novel ways to enable insurers to pay the expected high prices. “We recognize that most payers in the U.S. are not currently set up to support one-time therapies that generate long-term transformative benefits,” Ms. Pingpank said. Indeed, health care executives already are rushing to develop new payment models. When Kymriah was approved, officials at Novartis said they would take the unusual step of taking into account how well it worked in a particular patient. The company said it was collaborating with the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on an approach in which, for children and young adults, there would be no charge if the patient did not respond to the treatment within a month. If, as expected, Kymriah is approved for other blood cancers, its price may vary depending on how effective it is for those diseases. Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit manager that contracts with insurance companies to provide medications to patients, has taken up the cost question with gene therapy companies, insurers and the federal government. “It’s amazing how many think this is in the future,” said Dr. Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, said of the looming payment problem. “This is right now.” The idea favored by Dr. Miller and others is to pay for these novel drugs as you might a mortgage on a house. An insurer would pay a large fraction up front, when the patient is treated, and then make regular payments until the entire bill is paid — or the disease returns. That would require an unprecedented type of cooperation among insurers. Patients often change insurers, and there is no benefit to a new insurer in continuing payments for an injection that a patient had long ago — even if it was curative. Bluebird Bio has a market capitalization of $4 billion, although it has no product yet, noted Dr. Peter B. Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Investors “are confident that when they get one of these cures approved, they will get a magnificent price,” he said. Drug makers have long argued that rising prices are necessary to support the costs of research and development. Yet a study published on Monday estimated the cost of developing a new cancer drug to be far less than many experts had believed, even as revenues have soared. The industry’s warnings that without high reimbursements, the field of gene therapy will wither is “the classic story of the boy who cried wolf,” Dr. Bach said. Development costs are already mitigated by special economic incentives for orphan drugs, he noted, including a 50 percent tax credit on the costs of research and development, among others. And once a company creates a delivery system — say, a modified virus to deliver a gene into a cell — it can be used over and over again to create a variety of treatments, said Dr. James Wilson, director of the gene therapy program at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. That should reduce development costs, Dr. Wilson said. And because the diseases in question are so rare, the F.D.A. is allowing gene therapy companies to conduct very small clinical trials — with as few as a dozen or so patients, and without control groups for comparison. That costs much less than a typical drug trial, which can involve tens of thousands of patients. Dr. Wilson has his own nightmare about gene therapy, a cautionary tale that nags at him. It involves Glybera, the first such drug approved in the West. Glybera was approved in Europe for treatment of a very rare disease, lipoprotein lipase deficiency. In some ways, it was a poor start for gene therapy. What evidence there was to support it came from studies in just 27 people, with no control group. The drug was not lifesaving; the disease is not fatal. Mostly, Glybera was supposed to reduce the frequency of hospitalizations. But the price was stunning: more than $1 million per treatment. It was used just once, by a patient in Germany. Then it was abandoned in the face of low demand. “We are at a real crossroads,” Dr. Wilson said. One more debacle like Glybera, he fears, and investors will give up on the field. Then patients with rare diseases “will be left in the dust.” An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the chief executive of UniQure. As two subsequent references noted correctly, he is Matt Kapusta, not Kapusto.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/11/health/cost-gene-therapy-drugs.html,health,The New York Times,health,1285
2018-05-09 00:00:00,2018,5.0,9,Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy: Seattle head tax 'super dangerous',"Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy said on Wednesday it's ""super dangerous"" for Seattle to consider taxing large companies — and risk dampening job creation — to offset the effects of gentrification and homelessness. In particular, Jassy was critical of the proposed ""head tax,"" which would apply to 585 businesses with $20 million or more in yearly revenue, according to The Seattle Times. Those companies would pay a tax of 26 cents per full-time employee per hour for 2019 and 2020, which would convert to a 0.7 percent payroll tax after that. In 2015, Seattle and King County declared a state of emergency over the rising number of homeless people in the area, calling it ""just as devastating to thousands as flood or fire."" Proponents of the so-called head tax say that the businesses who have benefited from Seattle's economic boom can afford to contribute to programs that mitigate rising rents. But Jassy told CNBC's ""Squawk Alley "" on Wednesday that he felt the city would be better off ""working with the business community."" ""I would say that things like the head tax in Seattle I think are super dangerous for cities to implement. What company is going to want to start — or move to or grow in — a city that penalizes them for hiring full-time employees?"" Jassy said. ""These are serious problems in all of our major cities: homelessness, education, there are are a number of them. And they require hard thinking and innovative solutions. But I think cities are so better off working with the business community towards joint solutions, rather than trying to tax them."" While Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has been criticized for his limited philanthropic giving, Jassy pointed towards Amazon's work with Mary's Place Family Shelter as an example. Amazon's new headquarters include a 47,000 square-foot space donated to Mary's Place, which will hold 65 rooms, enough to shelter 200 homeless people each night. Amazon also donated 25,000 square feet to FareStart, which helps train food service workers. ""We are very involved in the community,"" said Jassy, who was the highest paid executive at Amazon in 2016, earning $35.6 million. Amazon reportedly paused construction planning on a new building in Seattle until the vote on the tax, and construction workers have protested the tax. Jassy's comments also come as Amazon reviews bids for its new headquarters — bids which may offer Amazon sizeable tax breaks in other cities. Jassy said the final location will be announced by the end of the year. In the meantime, some Seattle lawmakers said they are willing to meet Amazon at the table. ""If Amazon generally wants to engage about how they can be part of the solution, we welcome that conversation,"" Seattle city council member Mike O'Brien, a sponsor of the tax, told The Seattle Times. ""But we need companies that are profitable and making billions of dollars every year to help with the folks that are being forced out of housing and ending up on the street.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/09/amazon-web-services-ceo-andy-jassy-seattle-head-tax-super-dangerous.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,501

2019-12-09 00:00:00,2019,12.0,9,Crowdfunding disaster Coolest Cooler is shutting down and blaming tariffs for its downfall,"The company behind the Coolest Cooler, widely known as one of the biggest Kickstarter failures, is officially going out of business. An update sent to backers from the company’s CEO Ryan Grepper this weekend says the company is ending operations, and tariffs are to blame. Grepper says a tariff increase on Chinese imports to 25 percent affected the “entire Coolest product line.” “It was devastating to our business, and I know it was felt by many of you in one way or another as consumers and thousands of small businesses everywhere,” he writes. While the tariffs are certainly real, it’s odd for this update to arrive five years after the Coolest Cooler originally showed up on Kickstarter. The campaign raised more than $13 million in 2014 to build a high-tech cooler with a built-in blender, and it’s still the second-highest grossing project on the platform, after the Pebble Time smartwatch. The team ultimately put the cooler up for sale on Amazon before it even shipped all its owed product to backers. In the end, it shipped roughly two-thirds of the 60,000 coolers it owed people, the company said in a project update in March 2018. Welp... so today, 5 years after I backed this thing, #CoolestCooler let’s me know I’m not getting anything. cool. pic.twitter.com/DWjP04HSYi “There’s always a risk in creating something new, and some projects won’t end up working out,” Kickstarter said in a statement. “In this case, unfortunately, 1/3 of the backers won’t receive the reward they were promised. We’ve worked hard to make it clear that Kickstarter is not a store. And in the five years since this project was funded, we’ve taken steps to help creators be more transparent with backers, and to better understand what it will take to bring their project to life.” Coolest settled with Oregon’s Department of Justice in 2017. The agreement involves paying backers $20 per cooler that wasn’t received. It seems possible that backers might not receive their $20, particularly if the company is out of cash.

2018-03-29 00:00:00,2018,3.0,29,Amazon reportedly wants to create checking accounts for teens,"Amazon is in early discussions with banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Capital One Financial Corp. to create something akin to checking accounts that will be aimed at teenagers, according to sources who spoke to Bloomberg. While Amazon has been able to successfully market to millennials and older groups, those who are 18–24 have been elusive because they lack debit cards, tend to not have bank accounts, and choose to purchase items at physical stores, according to Bloomberg. Last year, the company introduced Amazon Cash, a way for customers without credit, debit, or bank cards shop online. A barcode is generated on the Amazon website, which can then be displayed on a mobile device or printed out, and brought to a retailer like CVS Pharmacy or Speedway to deposit funds into an Amazon wallet online. While it solves a need, the process is a bit cumbersome and there is an opportunity to provide a more streamlined experience. Those under 18 usually can’t open bank accounts by themselves, and checking accounts for students generally come padded with additional charges. By partnering with banking institutions, Amazon could cater to a demographic that it is looking to capture, and banks themselves have historically not serviced well. Gavin Rosenberg, a senior director at the payments processor Total System Services Inc. tells Bloomberg that Amazon could tie this all into Alexa, making payments even easier. “The younger generations are less concerned about privacy, so they’re more apt to use them,” Rosenberg said.",https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/29/17175928/amazon-checking-accounts-teenagers,Tech,The Verge,technology,248

2016-12-21 00:00:00,2016,12.0,21,U.S. university launches tool to show how fake news spreads,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Researchers at Indiana University have developed a new tool that shows how fake news and unverified stories spread through social media. The search engine, dubbed Hoaxy, is the latest effort to combat the proliferation of fake news, which proliferated during the U.S. presidential campaign, with one bogus post-Election Day story sparking a real-life event when a gunman fired shots into a Washington, D.C., restaurant. “It is a very serious problem,” said Filippo Menczer, the director of the university’s Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research, which launched Hoaxy. Misinformation and propaganda are not new, but Menczer said social media has added a new component because the information is pre-selected to be in line with people’s own opinions. “Social media makes it more likely that I am more exposed to false information that I am likely to believe,” he added. Hoaxy does not determine whether a story is real but it shows how it is spread online and shows related fact-checking. The free website, hoaxy.iuni.iu.edu, can be used by reporters, researchers and the public. If a user suspects a story is false they can search it in the website to see how it was spread and to what degree it went viral. “There is no editorial judgment,” Menczer said in an interview. “We don’t look at the claims, or vet them, or say they are true or false.” It examines websites, compiled by news organizations and fact-checking sites, that are known to post satire, hoaxes or conspiracy theories. It also tracks links to the stories on Twitter and Facebook so users can see how often the stories have been shared. “You can observe who are the hubs, who are the main spreaders and most influential who have spread these claims and fact-checks,” said Menczer. News and tech companies including Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc are also trying to tackle fake news and have formed a coalition to improve the quality of information on social media. Menczer said he started looking into the phenomenon of false news in a research experiment several years ago. He created a website with celebrity stories clearly marked as fake and promoted them on social bookmarking websites that were popular at the time.

According to Facebook, each app that you log into will get your gender, networks you belong to, username, your user ID, your full name and your profile picture. They also get access to your full friends list and any other public information on your profile. And you may have used this method to log into an app dozens or — as I discovered on my account — even hundreds of times. This issue is at the center of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal that the social media company is facing right now. The political research firm was able to access data on more than 50 million Facebook users through a third-party personality quiz application, without the knowledge or consent of users. The quiz maker wasn't supposed to pass the information along, but Facebook at the time had no technical measures in place to prevent it. Cambridge Analytica later used this and other information to create detailed psychological profiles of Facebook users and to micro-target political ads at some of them, according to recent reports in the Observer and The New York Times. Here's how to see what apps have your data and how to cut them off. This will show you all the apps that have access to the aforementioned data. In this case — and I had no idea until my editor asked me to write this story — I've granted access to 224 apps ranging from Airbnb to apps I don't even remember, like ""BarkApproved."" To delete an app, just select it and tap the ""X"" button in the right corner, then select remove. Unfortunately, any data that you've previously shared will still be obtained by the app, but it won't get any new data on you. You can also manage settings for apps you still want to use. For Airbnb, for example, instead of deleting it I selected the ""edit"" button while hovering over the app and then unchecked options that let it view my friends list and e-mail address.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/20/how-to-see-which-facebook-apps-have-access-to-your-data.html,Tech Guide,CNBC,technology,369
2018-08-23 00:00:00,2018,8.0,23,Now more than 500 sick from outbreak linked to McDonald's salads," (CNN)The number of people sick from an outbreak of a gastrointestinal illness, called cyclosporiasis, linked to McDonald's salads is now 507, federal health officials said Thursday.   All of the illnesses have been confirmed with lab tests. Twenty-four of those individuals have been hospitalized.  The illnesses began between May 20 and July 21, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Illnesses have been reported in 16 states. The states are Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, Wisconsin and New York.   The patients in Connecticut, New York, Tennessee and Virginia all purchased their salads while they were visiting Illinois and the Florida patient purchased the suspect salad while in Kentucky, according to the CDC.  ""Epidemiologic evidence indicates that salads purchased from McDonald's restaurants are one likely source of these infections. The investigation is ongoing, and FDA is working to determine the sources of the ingredients that were in common to the salads served at McDonald's,"" the CDC said.  The cyclospora parasite causes intestinal illness in people who consume contaminated food or water. Symptoms can begin a week or more after consuming the parasite. They include diarrhea and frequent, sometimes explosive, bowel movements, according to the CDC. Those who are infected might also experience loss of appetite, weight loss, stomach cramps or pain, nausea, gas and fatigue. Vomiting, headache, fever, body aches and flu-like symptoms can also occur. The illness can last from a few days to a few months, and patients might feel better but then get worse again. Patients can be treated with antibiotics. In July, McDonald's pulled the suspected salad mix from approximately 3,000 locations and switched its supplier.  Subsequently, the outbreak investigation found the parasite in a sample of Fresh Express salad mix of romaine lettuce and carrots that had been distributed by the restaurant chain.  On July 27, Fresh Express issued a recall for some lettuce that had been supplied to wholesale and institutional customers.

2017-02-16 00:00:00,2017,2.0,16,The eSight 3 is an augmented reality headset designed to help the legally blind see,"At first glance, eSight’s headsets look a lot like any other VR or AR gear out there. But while most virtual reality systems are built to make digital worlds more realistic, the eSight aims to do just the opposite, using augmented reality headsets and digital technology to help bring the real world to individuals who are legally blind. The latest version, the eSight 3, is a lighter and cheaper version than the company’s previous models, but they all work on the same principles. Using a high-speed HD camera and two OLED displays, video is processed algorithmically to enhance contrast and quality, which allows users with vision issues to better see the world around them. It’s a fully portable device, with roughly six hours of battery life that’s controlled using an attached remote. There are also some technical challenges that eSight had to consider when designing a device that’s designed to help replicate human vision. Low-latency is key, to ensure that the viewer is seeing the world in as close to real time as possible, as is maximizing peripheral vision so that users don’t get nauseous or lose balance. The eSight is also designed to automatically focus, allowing users to transition between nearsighted objects to long distance at ease, as well as offering the ability to manually zoom in on items. According to The Wall Street Journal, the company is taking advantages of recent improvements in technology from VR headsets and smartphones that have trickled down to improve the latest version of the eSight. So far, the company has sold roughly a thousand units, but at $10,000 apiece, they’re not cheap (and most insurances apparently don’t cover the product), although eSight’s chief executive Brian Mech notes to the WSJ that getting devices to users is “a battle we are starting to wage.” The eSight obviously isn’t a device for everyone. But it’s nice to see that with all of today’s rapid technological advances that there are companies working to take leaps forward to help improve the lives of others.",https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/16/14637804/esight-3-augmented-reality-headset-legally-blind-see,Tech,The Verge,technology,338

2017-02-24 00:00:00,2017,2.0,24,Even ‘mild’ heart defects may affect kids’ school performance,"(Reuters Health) - Children born with heart defects, even minor ones, perform worse than other kids on third-grade reading and math tests, a new study finds. “While it was not surprising to see this finding in children with severe heart defects, it was a surprise to see that children with heart defects that are often considered mild may likewise have challenges in school,” lead author Dr. Matthew Oster from Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta told Reuters Health. “Parents and teachers should be aware that children with heart defects may benefit from early recognition and evaluation for potential learning challenges,” he said by email. Children with critical congenital heart defects, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome or transposition of the great arteries, who require surgery in infancy, are known to be at high risk for poor neurocognitive outcomes in childhood, Oster and his colleagues write in Circulation Cardiovascular Quality Outcomes. This “subset” of kids with severe heart defects typically undergoes intensive, and expensive, screening for these cognitive problems, but performing this kind of screening on all kids with congenital heart defects is not feasible, the authors note. Moreover, it would “not necessarily translate into the real-world outcomes that are of greatest interest to parents, most notably school performance,” they write. The researchers used records from three North Carolina databases to identify 2,807 children with congenital heart defects and 6,355 children without them, then compared the kids’ performance on standardized reading and math tests given at the end of third grade. Nearly 45 percent of children with congenital heart defects failed to meet standards on at least one of the tests, compared with only 37.5 percent of children without congenital heart defects. One in five children with congenital heart defects failed both tests, compared with just one in seven children without congenital heart defects. Children with congenital heart defects were also more likely than other children to receive exceptional services in the third grade. Children with major and minor congenital heart defects underperformed on these tests, and both groups of children were more likely to receive exceptional services. “We should be aware that children with congenital heart defects may have challenges in school that go unrecognized,” Oster said. “We should consider formal neurocognitive evaluations when appropriate,” he added. “There are existing guidelines from the American Heart Association for children with severe heart defects to undergo a formal evaluation for neurocognitive deficits. These findings suggest that many without severe defects have similar challenges and may likewise benefit from such an evaluation,” he said. “Unfortunately,” Oster said, “access to such evaluations is quite limited in many areas of the country for a variety of reasons.” Source: bit.ly/2kRLmyk Circulation Cardiovascular Quality Outcomes, online February 22, 2017.",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-heartdefects-children-school-idUSKBN16326D,Health News,Reuters,health,453
2017-03-16 00:00:00,2017,3.0,16,"PTC Therapeutics to buy expensive DMD drug, signals price change","(Reuters) - PTC Therapeutics Inc said on Thursday it would buy Marathon Pharmaceuticals LLC’s recently-approved Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) drug, Emflaza, and promised to re-examine the hefty U.S. price tag for the treatment. PTC’s shares were down about 13 percent in afternoon trading. Duchenne’s is a rare, genetic disorder affecting about 9,000 U.S. patients that causes progressive muscle deterioration and kills most by the age of 30. Emflaza, known generically as deflazacort, belongs to a class of drugs called corticosteroids that are frequently used to treat DMD and other conditions. Marathon did not invent deflazacort and patients in the United States had been able to import it for as little as $1,000, but lost that option after Emflaza’s controversial U.S. approval in February. Marathon slapped a $89,000-per-patient annual price tag on Emflaza, drawing intense criticism from U.S. lawmakers and forcing it halt the steroid’s launch. “We’re re-examining the current price of Emflaza ... We believe a change needs to be had, but ... it’s really too premature to speculate on the price level,” PTC Chief Executive Stuart Peltz said on a conference call on Thursday. Even at a lower price, one-fourth or one-fifth of the current price, PTC could still cover acquisition costs, Nomura Instinet analyst Christopher Marai said. PTC said it would pay Marathon about $75 million in cash and about $65 million in stock, which could give Marathon up to a 20 percent stake in PTC. The deal will help PTC expand its U.S. footprint ahead of the potential approval of its drug, Translarna, Peltz said. Translarna, designed to treat a specific subset of DMD patients, is already available in Europe. The FDA rejected the drug last year, but is currently reviewing it and a decision is expected by October. Emflaza, however, is approved to treat all DMD patients and works by reducing inflammation and lowering the immune system’s activity. Although it is the first FDA-approved steroid for DMD, another steroid, prednisone, is also frequently used. PTC said it considers Emflaza a “disease-modifying” treatment. However, two U.S. lawmakers have questioned the data the FDA used to evaluate the steroid and why Marathon was given market exclusivity even though it did no significant research. The first and only other U.S.-approved DMD drug is Sarepta Therapeutics Inc’s Exondys 51, which was cleared in September despite stiff resistance from researchers within and outside the FDA.

2020-03-13 00:00:00,2020,3.0,13,Clamor grows for Trump to cut China tariffs in coronavirus response,"WASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - As President Donald Trump scrambles for new ways to cushion the economic blow from the fast spreading coronavirus, industry groups, lawmakers and even some government officials are reviving a previous request: cut tariffs on Chinese and other imported goods. Anti-tariff forces both outside and inside the government see the virus crisis as the biggest opportunity for rolling back at least some import taxes since a U.S.-China “Phase 1” trade deal was reached in December. They say repealing a Trump protectionist policy could save American companies and consumers billions of dollars and send a positive signal to investors, who sent U.S. stocks down about 10% on Thursday into bear market territory. Tariffs of up to 25% remain on some $370 billion worth of Chinese goods imports annually. U.S. importers were billed for $48.1 billion in duties on Chinese goods from the Trump administration’s “Section 301” tariffs over the past 20 months, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. “This is a tax that is fully within the authorities of the executive branch, so they can very quickly give American businesses and American consumers a tax cut by lifting the tariffs that are in place,” U.S. Representative Stephanie Murphy told Reuters on Thursday. The Florida Democrat urged U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Wednesday to declare a trade “detente” by removing tariffs on both Chinese and European goods to aid small and medium-sized businesses. Lighthizer, who for three years has led the Trump administration’s efforts to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, “was not receptive to the idea” during a closed-door meeting with members of the House Ways and Means Committee, Murphy said. USTR did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S.-China Business Council is also pressing for tariff reductions by both China and the United States as a way to help both economies weather coronavirus pressures. “Both economies are suffering from a common challenge,” said USCBC President Craig Allen. “Both sides should use this as an opportunity to rein in the self-inflicted damage that tariffs cause.” But there were differing views on tariffs within the Trump administration, Allen said, with “no clear consensus on moving forward with a tariff reduction no matter how obvious it may be that it’s in both countries’ interest.” Trump has touted his tough stance on China trade as a key differentiator from Democratic challengers in the November presidential election. Keeping tariffs in place on Chinese goods allows him to say he is maintaining leverage over China for a Phase 2 trade deal. But rapidly deteriorating financial markets and worries that COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, will grind worldwide economic activity to a halt may be changing some trade thinking inside the administration, said a person familiar with White House trade deliberations. “It’s not likely to happen” because of the election argument, the person said. “But COVID has changed a lot of things and industry sees an opening here.” Before the coronavirus significantly reduced its global forecasts, the International Monetary Fund had estimated that U.S. and Chinese tariffs still in place after a Phase 1 trade deal would reduce 2020 global economic output by about 0.5%, or around $450 billion. The National Association of Manufacturers on Monday published a coronavirus action plan that urged the administration to “develop a targeted list of products for which Section 301 tariffs and retaliatory tariffs can be suspended or removed to spur economic growth and job creation.” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin continues to advocate tariff reductions as a way to further economic growth, said Derek Scissors, a China policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute. “The Wall Street representatives in and out of the administration constantly push for tariff cuts, from the time the deal was struck through last week,” Scissors said. “The risk of a trade deficit jump later in the year, as the China tries to export its way to a V-shaped recovery, has blocked them.” Mnuchin told lawmakers last week that tariff reductions were not being considered at that time but as the situation progresses, “we’ll look at all the options that we think are important” to aid small firms and certain sectors of the economy. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, the administration’s loudest anti-China voice, tamped down any speculation that tariffs might be lifted. “There are no discussions within the White House about that. That is simply a fake news gambit by the usual Wall Street suspects who never met an American job they didn’t want to offshore for the sake of a buck,” he said. Even economists who support lifting tariffs say it may not be effective as a short-term stimulus. “Permanently lifting the tariffs on China is a good idea,” said Heritage Foundation economist Paul Winfree. “Rapid changes in trade policy linked specifically to the pandemic might not give them the bump they want because it will contribute to the long-run trade uncertainty that has depressed growth.” (Additional reporting by Jeff Mason; Editing by Heather Timmons and Alistair Bell)",https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-usa-trade/clamor-grows-for-trump-to-cut-china-tariffs-in-coronavirus-response-idUSL1N2B42MC,Healthcare,Reuters,health,835
2018-02-02 10:55:23,2018,2.0,2,"If Immigrants Are Pushed Out, Who Will Care for the Elderly?","The New Old Age In Dallas, a 93-year-old is worried about the woman who, for years, has come to her house four days a week to help with shopping, laundry, housecleaning and driving. “She’s just a wonderful person, someone I feel I can trust completely,” said the older woman. But because her helper is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, both women increasingly fear that she’ll be detained and deported. (I’m withholding their names for that reason.) “If this woman gets pulled over today, who will help my mother tomorrow?” said her daughter, an attorney in Oakland, Calif. In Brooklyn, Mary DiGangi, the human resources director at the Menorah Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing Care, recently asked local employment agencies to find 20 to 25 new nursing assistants and practical nurses. It’s a typical request, and usually, she said, “I’m flooded with applications the next day.” This time, she saw only five applications over a month. She thinks the Trump administration’s immigration policies and rhetoric have discouraged potential workers. Menorah, part of MJHS Health System, draws heavily on immigrants for its 3,500 employees. Among them are 25 Haitian-American nursing assistants and practical nurses whose temporary protected status was terminated in November. They will have to leave by July 2019, unless the Secretary of Homeland Security changes her mind. Other Menorah staffers brought to this country as children, now DACA recipients, also remain in limbo. “Employees have told me they know it’s going to be OK,” Ms. DiGangi said. “I’m not sure if they’re convincing me or themselves.” One in four of the direct-care workers in the nation’s nursing homes, assisted living facilities and home care agencies are foreign-born, according to an analysis of census data by P.H.I., the New York research organization. In the so-called gray market, where consumers hire home care workers directly and often pay them under the table, the proportion is likely far higher. “We’re seeing a growing work force shortage in direct care,” said Robert Espinoza, vice president of policy for P.H.I. “It’s affecting the entire industry, and it’s affecting older and disabled people and their families.” The shortage stems partly from a growing economy, said Robyn Stone, a veteran researcher at Leading Age, whose nonprofit members include long-term care providers. When employers are hiring, she explained, “these folks are likely to look down the street at a hospital that pays more, or another industry like fast food, and leave.” Mostly, however, what drives the labor shortage is long-term demographic change. Older people are living longer, most developing chronic diseases and disabilities; the sheer numbers of baby boomers further increases the demand for assistance. But the population of working-age women, who typically provide care both paid and unpaid, has shrunk — and they have more career options than they once did. So providing care for older people, in their homes or in facilities, has become the classic example of a job native-born Americans would rather not take. It’s physically demanding work that pays poorly — the median wage for home care workers was $10.49 an hour in 2016, P.H.I. reports — and usually doesn’t include benefits. The aides, mostly women, who serve in this crucial but low-income role frequently qualify for federal programs like food stamps or Medicaid. Their advocates have long argued for ways to improve these jobs, with more training and higher pay. For now, though, what P.H.I. calls the “caregiving gap” has been filled by immigrants. The number of immigrants in direct care ballooned from 520,000 in 2005 to approximately one million in 2015, including those who work independently through state home care programs, P.H.I. estimates. In New York, California, New Jersey and Florida, more than 40 percent of direct-care workers are immigrants. If large numbers of immigrants become unable to work or fearful of attracting unwanted attention, “this is going to create tremendous strain,” Dr. Stone said. Already, “we’ve heard of nursing homes that have shut down, or stopped admissions, because they could not hire enough people.” Excluding the gray market, the majority of aides and nursing assistants are American citizens. But P.H.I. has calculated that nearly 35,000 come from Haiti, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras, whose immigrants have had temporary protected status in the United States. The administration has so far terminated T.P.S. status for Haitians, Salvadorans and Nicaraguans; other nationalities may follow. Immigrants from Sudan, whose T.P.S. status was also terminated, will have to leave the United States as early as this fall. Another nearly 11,000 direct care workers come from largely Muslim countries affected by the Trump travel ban and might leave if family members can never join them. An unknown number of workers are DACA recipients who might eventually be forced to leave. Even when workers are legal residents, though, they may consider moving when relatives are deported. Whole neighborhoods and communities feel targeted. “Just the scrutiny is casting a pall,” Dr. Stone said. “If they’re afraid, if they won’t apply for jobs, we could see more shortages.” As that happens, the effects ripple through nursing facilities and home care agencies. “When we struggle to fill positions, the people already working here are working harder,” Ms. DiGangi pointed out. They may take more shifts, or become responsible for more patients. Eventually, especially in rural areas where home care workers have to travel long distances to clients, older adults (and younger ones with disabilities) may not be able to hire people who can help them remain in their homes. In cities and suburbs, older immigrants who want assistance from those who speak their native language could be similarly at a loss. In the San Fernando Valley in Southern California, a home care worker named Norma, who fled El Salvador with her family almost 20 years ago, assists her 91-year-old disabled neighbor under a state program. She works every day from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., helping her client bathe, dress, eat, and circle the block in a wheelchair. Both Spanish speakers, the women have drawn close. “In the morning, when I arrive at the house, she brightens and says, ‘Norma, you’re here!’” Norma told me through an interpreter. But the administration has terminated Salvadorans’ temporary protected status as of September 2019. “I feel scared,” Norma said. “There’s so much unknown.” While she worries for herself and her husband — and her two daughters, who are DACA recipients — she also fears for her client. “If one day I don’t show up to work, nobody will be there to get her out of bed and change her,” she said. “This could be my own mom, who would be alone one day if nobody came to help.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/health/illegal-immigrants-caregivers.html,health,The New York Times,health,1105
2017-02-15 19:00:00,2017,2.0,15,Study Links Cancer to Living Within a Mile of Oil Wells,"A new study finds that young people with a rare type of cancer more often live near oil and gas sites than those with other cancers. The study, published today in the journal PLOS One, found that those diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia are 4.3 times more likely to live in the densest area of active oil and gas wells. By contrast, researchers found no correlation between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and high-density oil and gas development.  The report notes that oil and gas development has grown rapidly in the past 15 years; such activity can potentially emit toxic substances into the air and water. Benzene, for example, is a recognized carcinogen often associated with such development. People living near oil and gas wells, the findings indicate, may have an increased risk for health effects, including cancer, from potential exposure to such toxins. More than 15 million Americans now live within one mile of such developments.  ""Over 378,000 Coloradans and millions of Americans currently live within a mile of at least one oil and gas well, and petroleum development continues to expand into residential areas,"" read a statement by lead investigator Lisa McKenzie, assistant research professor at the Colorado School of Public Health.  The study included 743 people younger than 24 years old who lived in towns and rural areas in Colorado—all were diagnosed with cancer between 2001 and 2013. Using information from the Colorado Oil and Gas Information System, researchers built a data set of oil and gas wells in rural Colorado, including the dates each well was active. They then compared addresses for those diagnosed with cancer, weighting proximity to the wells and accounting for age, race, gender, income, elevation of residence and year of cancer diagnosis. There are limitations to the study, including the low occurrence of leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in rural Colorado. All the study participants had been diagnosed with cancer, and the research was limited by lack of information about their previous residences and individual characteristics such as common infections and family history of cancer.  The report concludes that future research should address these limitations by incorporating information about the specifics of oil and gas production and development, including levels of specific pollutants such as benzene. Further research should compare cases to controls without cancer, consider age and residential histories, and examine other potential environmental factors. Says McKenzie, ""More comprehensive research that can address our study's limitations is needed to understand and explain these results.""",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pgxbzn/study-links-cancer-to-living-within-a-mile-of-oil-wells,Health,Vice,health,409
2019-12-27 00:00:00,2019,12.0,27,Amazon's big bet on UK food delivery is in jeopardy,"London (CNN Business)Britain's competition regulator is escalating its investigation into whether Amazon's planned investment in UK food delivery company Deliveroo would reduce competition and harm consumers. The Competition and Markets Authority said in a statement Friday that it had opened a ""phase 2"" probe after the companies failed to address its concerns about how the deal would affect the market for online deliveries of restaurant meals and groceries.  ""There's a real risk that it could leave customers, restaurants and grocers facing higher prices and lower quality services as these markets develop,"" Andrea Gomes da Silva, the regulator's executive director, said in statement earlier this month.  The in-depth investigation could delay the completion of the deal, hurting Deliveroo in the ultracompetitive UK market while giving rivals Just Eat (JSTTY) and Uber (UBER) Eats a boost. A spokesperson for Deliveroo said the company would continue to work closely with the regulator.  ""We are confident that we will persuade the [Competition and Markets Authority] of the facts that this minority investment will add to competition, helping restaurants to grow their businesses, creating more work for riders, and increasing choice for customers,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. Amazon (AMZN) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company previously defended the deal, saying it would bolster innovation, create jobs and lead to the development of new products. Amazon's UK ambitions Amazon led a $575 million funding round into Deliveroo in May, signaling that the company could become a key part of its global food delivery ambitions.  Deliveroo operates in 14 countries including Australia and France. It is present in more than 100 towns and cities across Britain, offering online delivery services for restaurants and convenience stores.  The Competition and Markets Authority ordered Amazon (AMZN) to pause its investment in July while it investigated whether the deal amounted to a takeover.  Earlier this month, the regulator said that it was also concerned that the deal would discourage Amazon from re-entering the online food delivery market as a competitor to Deliveroo in the future. The companies fought for the same customers before Amazon shuttered its Amazon Restaurants business last year. Amazon's direct participation in the restaurant delivery business would ""significantly increase competition in online restaurant food delivery,"" the regulator said. The antitrust authority also warned that the deal would damage competition in the emerging market for online grocery delivery, where Amazon and Deliveroo are two of the strongest players.

Rees said the WHO was “very concerned” that this number was slightly higher than last year, and urged governments against complacency in the battle to eradicate the paralysing disease.

That's the thought-provoking—yet thankfully still fictional—premise presented by one designer who attended Biofabricate, a conference in New York City examining how new advances in organic materials are changing our world. In an exclusive video interview, Tina Gorjanc, the designer behind the Pure Human Project, tells us about her double-edged mission: to imagine how biotech will infiltrate the luxury goods market, and expose legislative loopholes that protect human genetic information. Gorjanc raised eyebrows earlier this year when she first unveiled her work in this area, and said it could be used to create leather products with synthetic human skin ""grown"" from the DNA of famed fashion designer Alexander McQueen. Though Gorjanc hasn't actually done this, nor made any synthetic skin yet products yet (her creations are made from pig leather dyed and treated to look human), she has filed a real patent in the UK for the process.

2020-01-16 00:00:00,2020,1.0,16,New iPhones will have 'refreshed' Face ID and 3D camera: Barclays,"Barclays' semiconductor analysts said in a note to investors on Thursday that Apple's new iPhones, which are expected to launch this fall, will have a new version of Face ID and fancy new 3D camera sensors. Apple's Face ID, its facial recognition system used to unlock the iPhone without a fingerprint, was changed in the 2019 iPhones, too, and is now faster than before. Barclays said that Face ID will be ""refreshed,"" but doesn't mention new features. Barclays also said the high-end ""Pro"" models of Apple's 2020 iPhones, which will succeed the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max, will have new time of flight (ToF) 3D depth camera sensors. These can help iPhones create 3D maps of rooms and may also help Apple improve its augmented reality (AR) applications. AR allows Apple and developers to overlay digital objects on top of the real world, but it works best when the iPhone is able to understand the room it's in. ToF is already used in some Samsung phones, such as the Galaxy Note 10+. Samsung has demonstrated how the sensors can be used to capture a picture of an object and then quickly create a 3D model. So, someone with a 3D printer at home might be able to print a replica. And since ToF provides depth data, it could also be used to improve portrait images on iPhones. Those are the types of images where the subject remains in focus while the background is blurred. With more depth information, Apple could make those pictures even clearer and avoid some instances where the camera improperly blurs part of the person in the foreground of a picture. TF Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo, a top Apple analyst with an excellent track record of predicting future Apple gadgets, first said in July that Apple is planning to include the new time of flight sensors for its pro-model iPhones. The 2020 iPhones will also include support for new 5G networks in the U.S., according to Kuo.",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/16/new-iphones-will-have-refreshed-face-id-and-3d-camera-barclays.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,332

2017-11-13 00:00:00,2017,11.0,13,New blood pressure range means half of Americans have hypertension,"(Reuters) - Tighter blood pressure guidelines from U.S. heart organizations mean millions more people need to make lifestyle changes, or start taking medication, in order to avoid cardiovascular problems. Americans with blood pressure of 130/80 or higher should be treated, down from the previous trigger of 140/90, according to new guidelines announced on Monday by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology. At the new cutoff, around 46 percent, or more than 103 million, of American adults are considered to have high blood pressure, compared with an estimated 72 million under the previous guidelines in place since 2003. High blood pressure accounts for the second-largest number of preventable heart disease and stroke deaths in the United States, second only to smoking. The guidelines do not change the definition of normal blood pressure as 120/80 or lower. Potentially deadly high blood pressure can be brought under control with a wide array of medications, many sold as relatively inexpensive generics. The drug classes include angiotensin receptor blockers, such as Novartis AG’s Diovan, calcium channel blockers, like Pfizer Incs’s Norvasc, ACE inhibitors, including Pfizer’s Altace, and diuretics, such as Merck & Co Inc’s Hyzaar. But the drugs have side effects and the new guidelines emphasize lifestyle changes including weight loss, diet and exercise as the first tool for combating hypertension. “I think this will encourage both patients to adhere to recommendations but also clinicians to be more vigorous in their attempts to prescribe lifestyle changes,” said Dr. Pamela Morris, chair of the ACC’s committee on prevention of cardiovascular disease. Lifestyle modifications are the cornerstone for treatment, but the guidelines also stress that patients assessed to be at high risk of cardiovascular problems will be started on medication. A large, government-sponsored study of hypertension patients aged 50 and older showed in 2015 that death from heart-related causes fell 43 percent and heart failure rates dropped 38 percent when their systolic blood pressure was lowered below 120 versus those taken to a target of under 140. But patients in the 120 systolic blood pressure group had a higher rate of kidney injury or failure, as well as fainting. Concerns about those side effects, as well as the fact that the close monitoring seen in a clinical trial is hard to replicate, led the AHA, ACC and other groups to select the 130 systolic blood pressure target. The new guidelines also emphasize the importance of accurate blood pressure measurements, using an average of different readings at different times. Adults with blood pressure of 130/80 “already have double the risk of heart attack compared to someone in the normal range,” said Dr. Paul Whelton, professor at Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine and School of Medicine in New Orleans and lead author of the new guidelines. “It doesn’t mean you need medication, but it’s a yellow light that you need to be lowering your blood pressure, mainly with non-drug approaches.” Reporting by Deena Beasley; Editing by James Dalgleish",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-hypertension/new-blood-pressure-range-means-half-of-americans-have-hypertension-idUSKBN1DD2Q2,Health News,Reuters,health,497
2018-10-15 15:42:00,2018,10.0,15,Breastfeeding and Nursing Rooms Now Required in U.S. Airports,"Breastfeeding moms, rejoice — nursing and pumping in airports will finally get a little bit easier thanks to a new law that requires all major U.S. airports to have a lactation room. Thanks to the bill — named the Friendly Airports for Mothers Act (FAM) of 2017 — all large and medium airports must have a lactation room in each building. And uncomfortably nursing in a public bathroom will be a thing of the past, as one of the requirements is that the lactation room is separate from the airport bathrooms. FAM also lays out a few more provisions, including that the lactation rooms have a door that can lock, are fully accessible to people with disabilities and include seating, a table or other flat surface and an electrical outlet. Plus, all men’s and women’s restrooms in the airport must have a changing table. The bill was introduced in May 2017 as bipartisan legislation from Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Representative Stephen Knight (R-CA). It was later incorporated into the five-year reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration that President Trump signed on Oct. 5. Duckworth, who became the first Senator to give birth in office when daughter Maile arrived on April 9, wrote in an op-ed that she wanted to make airports more breastfeeding-friendly after poor experiences while traveling with her older daughter Abigail, now 3. “As a nursing mother, I had to stick to a feeding and expressing schedule, including when I was at the airport, but I quickly realized that finding a clean, accessible, private space was stressful and inordinately difficult,” she wrote in Cosmopolitan in Sept. 2017. “While I was comfortable breastfeeding my daughter in public, I did not want to express next to strangers using the same outlets to recharge their electronic devices. At many airports, I was redirected to a bathroom, forced to pump in a bathroom stall. We would never ask our fellow travelers to eat their sandwiches in a bathroom, but there I was, expressing milk for my child on a toilet seat.” Duckworth added that the lactation rooms would come out of airports’ existing improvement funds — with no additional cost to taxpayers. “If a mother chooses to breastfeed their child, she should not have to worry about whether she can find a clean, private place to nurse or express breast milk while she’s traveling; she has enough to worry about already,” she said. Mona Liza Hamlin, the chair of the U.S. Breastfeeding Coalition, said in a statement that the passage of the FAM Act is an important move towards better support for breastfeeding mothers. “This is a strong step forward toward a world where breastfeeding families across our country are seamlessly supported wherever they are — at their places of work, in their communities, in an airport, anywhere,” she said. “No one likes flight delays but for people who are lactating, extra time in the airport can mean finding a place to express milk or risking a dwindling milk supply or even infection. We look forward to building on this momentum and continuing to support breastfeeding people and families in all places and spaces.”",https://people.com/health/breastfeeding-rooms-all-major-us-airports-new-law/,health,People,health,523
2017-03-25 13:00:00,2017,3.0,25,YouTube's Gun Reviewers Are 'Guns & Ammo' Magazine for the Internet Age," YouTube is filled with time-wasting distractions: sports bloopers, alt-right propaganda, fitness and nutrition quackery, trick shot bros, ""let's play"" video game tutorials, and firearms.    Lots and lots of firearms.  Like every other niche subject nurtured and cultivated by YouTube's existence, videos of people firing guns—and reviewing the performance of said guns—have gone from low-fi and amateurish to professional quality in under a decade. Now a video such as ""5 Guns The Government Doesn't Want You To Have,"" posted by Eric Blandford—Iraqveteran8888 on YouTube—can rack up 10 million views from its core audience of 1.3 million subscribers. Meanwhile, the Military Arms Channel's (537,000 subscribers) ""IWI Israel Factory Tour"" (IWI manufactures the Uzi, among other popular guns) boasts better production values than many History Channel specials.   How does one make a living firing a different gun every day, and how do they fit into the greater debate about gun control in the US? I reached out to the YouTube stars themselves to learn how it's done.    ""I started my channel in 2008, before there were so many content creators it was hard to get noticed,"" said Tim Harmsen, an ex-Marine who operates the Military Arms Channel as well the gun megastore Copper Custom Armament in Valparaiso, Indiana. ""People like Matt Drudge had really paved the way, showing that you could distribute your own content outside mainstream media channels. I started editing my movies on iMovie, but incorporated better film equipment, improved my technical skills, and moved to Final Cut Pro 10.""  Harmsen, the owner of a gun shop, uses his channel to promote that business. ""As far as reviews go, I'm totally independent from sponsors, because the real value of my site comes from the fact that it attracts customers from all over the world to my store,"" he told me. ""I've been recognized while in Turkey. I've had people come from countries like China simply to visit my store. And one of my local competitors has a television in his store that plays my videos.""  Steven Wilson, an Army veteran and expert marksman who operates the SafeArmsReview channel, reviews guns that he owns as well as ones that friends have loaned him. ""Most of what I review are guns that I and others like, usually entry-level firearms that are not too expensive.  However, I'm looking to partner with a gun store that will send me T&E (training & evaluation) guns,"" he said, describing the method by which many gun reviewers receive the weapons that appear in their videos. ""A company sends a T&E gun for a person to review. After the review is completed, the reviewer sends it back via a federal firearms license.""  For Harmsen, one of the thrills of internet reviewing has been the ability to popularize weapons that warrant additional attention. ""I was one of the first reviewers who really picked up on the IWI [Israel Weapons Industry] Tavor rifle, just as that company was expanding operations in the US market. And I've been fortunate to tour the IWI factory in Israel, the MKE [Mechanical and Chemical Industry Company] factory in Turkey, the CZ [Czech Arms] factory in the Czech Republic...I've been able to introduce consumers to a wide variety of weapons.""  Steven Wilson, who also began making gun videos as a hobby, stressed that the quality of a video has as much to do with the skill level of the user as the gun being filmed. ""To me, it matters how the firearm is used on camera. You can have a cool looking M4 (an AR-15 variant) but if the actor doesn't know how to use it correctly, that can kill the scene—pun intended. However if an actor knows how to manipulate a firearm correctly in a dynamic way, that makes the gun look 'cool'...think of  John Wick-type stuff.""   Both Steven Wilson and Tim Harmsen responded to requests for comment, but several other YouTube channel operators either politely rejected Motherboard's inquiries or stated that they didn't want their comments to be taken out of context. But despite the fact that the political bent to most of these review videos is avowedly pro-gun owner—much as many video game reviews defend the reviewers' choice to play violent video games—gun review videos primarily showcase these expert users' obsession with gun safety and maintenance. ""Safety is a huge concern for me and one that I carried over from my time in the military,"" said Wilson, who was a firearms instructor in the Army and is currently an NRA firearms and self defense instructor.  Tim Harmsen agreed. ""Growing up in Kansas, guns were just part of the culture: a tool to be used safely. Everybody there owned a gun, and YouTube hasn't changed that. But it has let a new generation of gun experts build an audience. In other words, we reviewers can reach all the people that  Guns & Ammo could during the 1980s and 1990s, and then some. This has always been a country where people used firearms, where firearm ownership rates were high. None of that has changed, but it's so much easier to learn about new products, and become knowledgeable about this subject."" Harmsen believes that ease of access to informational videos like his may make gun owners more skilled and responsible users. ""With most of my videos, the objective is to let viewers tag along with me while I shoot. While there are wilder and crazier YouTube gun channels out there today, people desperate to get noticed in a crowded field, I'm still committed to the principles of gun safety I believe every gun owner should follow. Guns are fun to watch and use, but they're not toys.""",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jpndxp/youtube-gun-reviewes,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,941
2017-12-06 23:34:00,2017,12.0,6,Does Birth Control Cause Cancer? Here's What You Need to Know,"No doubt, headlines can be scary. So if you’re reading the news that women who used hormonal birth control had a 20 percent higher risk of breast cancer and are side-eying your pack of pills right about now, we’re here to offer some perspective. First, let’s get into the study, which was just published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers followed 1.8 million Danish women ages 15 to 49 for nearly 11 years. The researchers tapped into the National Register of Medicinal Product Statistics for pharmacy records on filled birth control prescriptions. Then they consulted the Danish Cancer Registry for cases of breast cancer. In short, the two data points were compared and analyzed. They found that women who’d recently used or currently use hormonal contraception were 20 percent more likely to have developed breast cancer than women who had never used it. Those who used it for less than a year were the least at risk (their odds rose nine percent), while those who used it for more than 10 years had the highest risk—they were 38 percent more likely to develop breast cancer. Even after stopping, the risk stayed elevated for at least five years. Yikes. Though it’s not exactly clear why, it may be the estrogen or progesterone hormones present in these Rxs, though more research is needed to know exactly what’s going on. This finding is consistent with past research, which has also found a 20 percent bump in breast cancer rates. What was telling about this study, however, was that they included newer forms of birth control, like the vaginal ring, patches, implants, injections, and hormonal IUD—as well as current pill formulations that are lower in estrogen than in decades past—giving a more complete and updated picture from earlier research. While a 20 percent jump sounds like lot (and it’s significant statistically as far as research goes), it’s not as alarming as you may think. As the authors noted, hormonal contraception can be linked to one additional case of breast cancer for every 7,690 women using birth control every year. And we don't know what happened to these women, just that they were diagnosed. Plus, hormonal birth control offers some very important health benefits. Pregnancy protection, for one. But in addition to that, the authors concluded: “This risk should be weighed against important benefits of hormonal contraceptives such as good contraceptive efficacy and reduced risks of ovarian, endometrial, and perhaps colorectal cancer (at least for combined oral contraceptives that were commonly used in the 1970s and 1980s).” Previous studies have shown that birth control cuts the risk of endometrial cancer in half and cuts risk of ovarian cancer by 27 percent. An accompanying editorial by David J. Hunter, the director of the Harvard-Oxford program in epidemiology, also lends some insight. “First, the approximately 20 percent higher risk of breast cancer among women who currently use hormonal contraceptives and those who do not must be placed in the context of the low incidence rates of breast cancer among younger women,” he writes. For women younger than age 35, the increase in risk from hormonal birth control is just an additional two out of every 100,000 women. Those are very low odds. He also points out that some research shows that using it for longer than five years has a net effect of reducing your total risk of cancer. Considering breast cancer likelihood rises with age—and the link between hormonal contraception and the disease gets stronger as women age—you may consider talking with your doctor about other methods of birth control as you get into your 40s, Hunter notes. What is certain is that hormonal contraception is good for women’s health, according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. When Tonic contacted ACOG about the new study, Chris Zahn, vice president of practice replied in an emailed statement: “Contraception is a medical necessity for women during approximately 30 years of their lives. For many women, hormonal contraception—the pill, the patch, the ring, IUDs, and the implant—is among the most safe, effective and accessible options available. These methods offer women critical control over their health, including if and when to become pregnant, reducing risk of cervical cancer, and in some cases aiding with management of chronic conditions like acne or painful periods. As with any medical intervention, hormonal contraception is associated with specific health risks.” Zahn said ACOG takes the safety of contraception very seriously and reviews new research, but noted that there are several limitations of the paper. “While this study raises known associated risks between breast cancer and hormonal contraception, we believe a robust evaluation of the study, including the study design, is necessary to accurately interpret the findings and reach conclusions,” she wrote. “This should include consideration of other factors that have significant impact on the findings, including family history of breast cancer for both pre and post menopausal women, stage of disease, and morbidity or mortality from the breast cancer diagnoses.” If you’re concerned, you should talk to your doctor to weigh the benefits and risks of your choice in birth control, Zahn says. If you have certain medical conditions, like high blood pressure, a personal history of breast cancer, or you’re a smoker over age 35, hormonal contraception may not be the right choice for you, says ACOG. (Interestingly, ACOG says women with BRCA gene mutations benefit from taking the pill because it lowers their ovarian cancer risk.) But that’s a chat to have with your doctor. They’re there to help you make the right choice for your health.

2016-05-20 14:45:00,2016,5.0,20,These Photos Were Snapped by a Giant Seafloor Observatory Deep in the Pacific,"For the past decade, Ocean Networks Canada, based at the University of Victoria, has operated a massive cabled observatory at the bottom of the ocean. Working with underwater robots, ONC has wired the floor of the Pacific with fiber optic cable that transmits data, 24/7, about chemical, geological, physical, and biological processes in an area that's been almost completely inaccessible to us.  The data is delivered for free, over the internet, for anyone to use, whether it's scientists working on their own research, or people who are just curious about the deep.  In May and June, ONC scientists are at sea aboard two research ships, updating and expanding their network—""wiring the abyss,"" as they call it—using remote operated vehicles, or ROVs, that can be piloted from the ship's deck while they work on the information-transmitting nodes and cables deep underwater. They also have a ""crawler,"" Wally, tasked with exploring Barkley Canyon, which is up to 985m deep in some places.  The whole operation of burying cable in the sea floor, and repairing and installing new nodes, isn't without its challenges. Working deep in the ocean is tough.  I spoke to Adrian Round of ONC about this, via a satellite phone from out on the Pacific. He had been at sea since May 12, he said, and would be there until the end of the month. (The connection was awful, and the line often crackled, dropping some of his words.)  ""It can take three hours [for an ROV] just to get to the bottom,"" he said. ""If you've forgotten a tool or something at the surface, well, it's a six-hour round trip.""  ONC is adding 18 km of underwater cables to its operation, installing new monitoring instruments in the Endeavour hydrothermal vents off the BC coast.  Some of the sensors being installed at Barkley Canyon, at the leading edge of the Cascadia subduction zone—where one tectonic plate pushes under another—are earthquake early warning sensors, which will provide better warnings of earthquakes and tsunamis.  Oceanographer Kate Moran, president and CEO of Ocean Networks, said that this cabled underwater observatory has changed the way ocean science is done.  ""We've got a wide range of sensor types in the ocean, to get a persistent understanding of it,"" she told me, ""rather than piecing together an understanding by going to sea once a year for two weeks, in one location, and the ocean has changed again in the next few days.""  Watch more on Daily VICE:  ONC collects images ""with cameras we have right on the cables,"" Moran said. ""They're typically on a timer, because scientists don't want to contaminate the ocean with light.""  When the ROVs go underwater to do repairs or other chores, they bring along high-definition cameras that can capture images, too.  ""Scientists onboard [the research ships] instruct the ROV pilots,"" who are controlling and manipulating the robots under the ocean, Moran said. ""If they see something unusual, like some gas bubbles or a funny fish, they'll direct the pilot to stop, and take image or video.""  ONC runs livestreams from deep in the ocean. One comes from a hydrothermal vent, 2186m deep on the Juan de Fuca ridge. Another shows a rockfish conservation zone, 23m deep, off Vancouver island. They capture all kinds of weird things.  One video, from 2015, showed a giant crab swarm almost 1,000m below the surface.  Moran has been checking in on the research cruise via livestreams from aboard the ship, and underwater. She recently watched a repair being done on the node at the Barkley Canyon site, a power and communications hub for the system. It was damaged last year, apparently by a fishing trawler, cutting off all communications from that area with ONC.  ""I was a nervous wreck,"" Moran said. ""And then, it was amazing. Seeing the ships working together, and the ROVs, it was an amazing dance. Honest to god,"" Moran laughed, ""I was glued to the internet."" The node is now fixed and transmitting data again.  ONC is branching out, incorporating fishermen and women, and local ferries, in its ocean monitoring. ""We have sensors on ferries that cross the Strait of Georgia,"" she said. ""And we're engaging fishers to go out in their fishing area, and deploy a standard oceanographic sensor, which they lower from the surface to the seafloor and back.""  Data is then transmitted wirelessly, via a mobile app, to a tablet and uploaded to ONC's data management system, called Oceans 2.0.  The deep ocean is still a part of our planet that's barely understood by scientists and researchers, but cataloguing the changes that are happening there—a region that's being deeply affected by climate change, just like everywhere else—is crucially important.  ONC, a massive deep-ocean laboratory, is an important way to do that.

2016-10-27 15:49:00,2016,10.0,27,FCC Approves Landmark Broadband Privacy Protections for Consumers," Federal telecom regulators on Thursday approved tough new rules designed to give consumers more power over how internet service providers handle their personal data, in a major victory for public interest advocates and a bitter defeat for the nation's largest cable and phone companies. The new rules would for the first time establish clear, enforceable policies about how and when internet service providers like Comcast, AT&T and Verizon can use and share customer data for behavioral tracking and targeted advertising. ""What this item does is to say that the consumer has the right to make a decision about how her or his information is used,"" Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler said during the agency's open meeting on Thursday. ""It is the consumer's information, it is not the information of the network that the consumer hires to deliver that information."" Under the new policy, ISPs would be required to obtain ""opt-in"" consent from consumers before using or sharing ""sensitive information"" such as financial and health information, children's information, social security numbers, precise geolocation data, web browsing history, app usage data, and the content of online communications. The plan would also require ISPs to be much more transparent about what data they are collecting, how they are using it, and with whom they are sharing it. The FCC has been under increasing pressure to address growing concern among public interest advocates and privacy watchdogs about the power of broadband giants like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon to track and record everything that consumers do online, without their knowledge, for commercial purposes. Some 91 percent of adults ""agree or strongly agree that consumers have lost control of how personal information is collected and used by companies,"" according to a recent Pew Research poll. The FCC voted to approve the new rules by a 3-2 party-line vote, with the agency's three Democratic commissioners, including Wheeler and his colleagues Jessica Rosenworcel and Mignon Clyburn, voting in favor, and the two Republican commissioners, Ajit Pai and Mike O'Rielly, voting against. For Wheeler, the new privacy rules amount to the latest pro-consumer initiative that he has muscled through the agency. A former cable and wireless industry lobbyist, Wheeler has developed a reputation as an unlikely public interest champion during his three years leading an agency that wields broad regulatory power over the nation's cable, phone, and satellite companies. ""This marks a significant step forward in protecting consumer privacy,"" the DC-based consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge said in a statement. ""For the first time, internet service providers will be required to get consumer consent prior to using the sensitive information they collect. While much remains to be done to protect consumers online writ large, the Commission's rules establish a baseline level of protection for all."" The new privacy rules could have significant implications for AT&T's proposed $85 billion purchase of entertainment giant Time Warner. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson has argued that the combined company will be able to monetize the mountains of user data generated by users, such as browsing history and app usage, but the new FCC policy could make it more difficult to do so. Addressing an increasingly controversial issue, the proposed rules would increase disclosure requirements for controversial ""pay-for-privacy"" plans in which ISPs offer discounts in exchange for more intrusive access to consumer data. In a FCC fact sheet distributed Thursday, the agency said it would ""determine on a case-by-case basis the legitimacy of programs that relate service price to privacy protections.""  Language prohibiting controversial ""mandatory arbitration"" clauses that limit the legal rights of consumers who feel their privacy was violated was not included in the new policy. Such fine-print language requires consumers to ""agree"" to a third-party dispute resolution process, and precludes class action lawsuits. But in a victory for public interest advocates, the FCC committed to proceed with a rulemaking in February 2017 designed to address the issue. The cable industry opposed the new privacy rules, in part because the FCC's policy only applies to internet service providers, and does not cover websites like Google and Facebook, which also collect massive amounts of consumer data. (The Federal Trade Commission, not the FCC, has jurisdiction over these so-called ""edge providers."") As a result, the cable industry has complained that the FCC's policy puts it at a competitive disadvantage relative to the Silicon Valley giants, an argument that was echoed Thursday by the two Republican FCC commissioners. In a statement, NCTA—The Internet & Television Association, an industry trade group that represents some of the nation's largest broadband companies, blasted the new privacy rules. ""There is no lawful, factual or sound policy basis to justify a discriminatory approach that treats ISPs differently from some of the largest companies in the internet ecosystem that engage in similar practices but operate under different regulatory standards,"" the group said. Many analysts believe Wheeler's time at the FCC is running out, because it has traditionally been the prerogative of an incoming US president to nominate their own choice to lead the agency. In his time remaining, Wheeler hopes to pass new rules that would increase competition in the video ""set-top box"" market by requiring cable operators to offer software ""apps"" allowing consumers to access content like ESPN or CNN on the device of their choice, without the need to spend an average of $231 annually to rent a set-top box. Last month, Wheeler postponed a vote on the set-top box measure, in part because of fierce opposition from the cable industry, which has warned that the proposed policy could imperil intellectual property rights and improperly insert the FCC into licensing negotiations between content studios, programmers, and video distributors. It's unclear when Wheeler will take another crack at the set-top box initiative.

2017-01-01 18:00:24,2017,1.0,1,Google Helping Mobile Publishing? Some Publishers Are Not So Sure,"SAN FRANCISCO — Last month, Federico Viticci, who runs MacStories, a news site devoted to Apple and its products, made a change in how the site publishes articles for mobile gadgets. MacStories, he declared, would no longer support a Google-backed method for faster loading of mobile web pages, called AMP. Mr. Viticci said MacStories’s pages already loaded quickly without Google’s help. He also didn’t like the idea of Google’s obscuring his site’s links — with AMP, they read google.com instead of macstories.net — in the interest of expediency. “Feels good” to no longer use the Google standard, Mr. Viticci wrote on Twitter. Mr. Viticci’s experience underscores the ambivalent relationship that some web publishers have developed with what was supposed to be Google’s great boon for mobile publishing. When Google introduced Accelerated Mobile Pages, or AMP, in October 2015, it said the new format would help publishers with one of their biggest headaches on smartphones: Browsing mobile websites was so frustratingly slow that many smartphone users abandoned pages before they opened. AMP has since delivered on its promise of faster mobile web pages. Even so, publishers — of smaller sites, especially, or individual bloggers — are beginning to worry about giving too much control to Google in exchange for zippier web pages. What’s more, Google’s approach to AMP has rankled some critics already suspicious of the company’s outsize influence on the internet. Much of the publishers’ unease is rooted in Google’s presentation of AMP stories, which appear as if they are Google articles. That’s because Google, to speed up AMP, stores copies of publisher’s pages and serves them from its own internet network. So when a reader clicks an AMP link, the address bar at the top of the page displays google.com instead of the actual web address from the publisher. “It looks like a Google story,” said Danny Sullivan, founding editor of Search Engine Land, a web search news site. “That’s part of the reason why you’re getting the nervousness from some of these publishers.” Google said that it had designed AMP to prioritize speed and that it wanted to help — not harm — publishers, who get full accounting of traffic, data and advertising revenue. Publishers also retain control of their content and design. Google said serving up articles from its own internet network was the best way it knew to achieve the AMP speeds, which are as much as four times faster than a regular mobile web page. “We always try to present the content that is the best experience,” said David Besbris, Google’s vice president of engineering. Google started AMP in 2015 because it worried that competitors like Facebook were drawing web surfers inside their networks with faster-loading articles and keeping them there. For Google, those rival sites were siphoning people away from the open internet, where the search company — which created the internet’s most valuable property by organizing the expanse of the World Wide Web — typically operates. Now articles that use AMP appear prominently in Google search results on mobile devices. A Google search for “Donald Trump” on a smartphone brings back a horizontal carousel of articles from media organizations like Slate and The Wall Street Journal at the top of the page. If someone clicks the first story in the carousel, he or she is moved into a browser and can swipe instantly from one story to another without leaving Google’s network. Another benefit of AMP for Google is that it keeps activity on the web, and away from apps. More browsing on the internet means more web searches, and, in most cases, that means more Google. This is even more pronounced on mobile devices, where Google accounts for about 95 percent of all global web searches, according to StatCounter. Since AMP’s launch, the open-source project has won over many big publishers who praise Google’s responsiveness. They say readers are engaging more with ads on AMP because they actually get to the stories and it’s a better experience. There are more than 600 million pages running AMP on over 700,000 different domains, including publishers such as The New York Times and non-media sites like eBay. David Gehring, a former Google employee and the chief executive of Relay Media, a company that works with publishers to convert pages to AMP, said the format had been positive for publishers grappling with shrinking revenue in the shift from print to online advertising. He estimated that up to 10 percent of mobile web content was already on AMP. Yet Mr. Gehring also said Google suffered from “tone deafness” when it came to explaining the benefits of AMP, such as the ability for publishers to syndicate articles across the mobile web without losing advertising or traffic. That tone deafness has rubbed some publishers the wrong way. In October, the software developer Alex Kras created a stir when he wrote a post titled “Google May Be Stealing Your Mobile Traffic,” in which he recounted what had happened when he used AMP on his technology blog. After he enabled AMP on his WordPress publishing software, Mr. Kras said, his old posts displayed google.com and there was no easy way to redirect readers to his own site. “It made me feel like my site wasn’t my own,” Mr. Kras said. He later said the title of his blog post was inaccurate, but stood by his concerns that AMP could cost publishers mobile traffic, an assertion Google denies. Mr. Kras said smaller publishers had more to lose if they used AMP, since big publishers have more name recognition and readers are more likely to remember them as the source of a story. “Little guys like myself don’t have this luxury,” he wrote in another blog post after meeting with Google officials. Still, Mr. Kras decided to keep AMP because it was fast. ""For that, a lot of little things can be (temporarily) forgotten,” he said. Google may be starting to acknowledge some publishers’ concerns. Last month, Google told Search Engine Land that it planned to make changes to AMP in 2017 to make it easier for publishers to offer their own links and for readers to be redirected to their sites. Google did not elaborate on its plans. Several bigger publishers say they are pleased with AMP and do not see anything worrisome with Google. “Google has been a good partner,” said Mark Silverstein, the head of business development at The Huffington Post, which is planning to push almost all of its news content into AMP. “When they make decisions, they do a good job of explaining why they reached that decision.” Emily Smith, head of content operations at Condé Nast’s Wired magazine, said supporting AMP had pushed its mobile articles to the top of search results. For web surfers conditioned to believe that the most relevant information is presented first in search results, it’s important for a media organization to be near the top. “It’s like being above the fold in a newspaper,” she said. About 15 percent of The Washington Post’s traffic comes from AMP pages. The Post is now using the lessons from AMP to move its articles to a separate, faster-running mobile platform that runs like an app but does so over the web. Joey Marburger, director of products for The Post, said that its readers were scrolling further on AMP stories, but that it was building its own fast system to gain greater control over ads and features. “We have to be where our readers are coming from,” Mr. Marburger said. “But it’s also important to have more control over our own content.”",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/01/technology/google-amp-mobile-publishing.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,1266
2017-04-18 00:00:00,2017,4.0,18,Group sues over proposal to reverse new U.S. rule on prepaid cards,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group that supports a new rule governing prepaid cards sued the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Tuesday for information that it says could reveal why Republicans are trying to reverse the regulation. The bureau, created after the 2007-09 financial crisis to protect individuals against fraud, finished a regulation in October requiring prepaid card sellers such as Mastercard Inc (MA.N) and Greendot to display their terms prominently and limit overdraft fees. However, a resolution introduced in the U.S. Congress in February would wipe out the rule. Allied Progress, an advocacy group that seeks to hold Wall Street firms accountable and which sued in federal court for documents around drafting of the rule, says the resolution is a political favor to industry leader Total System Services Inc, or TSYS (TSS.N). According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the company has donated thousands of dollars to Georgia Senator David Perdue, a Republican member of the Banking Committee taking the lead on the resolution. TSYS’s Netspend division is based in Perdue’s home state and could lose at least $80 million a year in overdraft fees under the rule, according to the National Consumer Law Center. Perdue’s office says his objections to the rule are linked to his belief the CFPB has too much power. In February, Perdue introduced legislation to move funding for the agency from the Federal Reserve to the congressional budget. “While Allied Progress continues to recklessly defend this overreaching government agency, Senator Perdue will continue working fearlessly to provide congressional oversight and hold them accountable to the American people,” said Perdue’s spokeswoman, Caroline Vanvick. She added that Democrats, Republicans, and businesses had posted concerns about the rule on the CFPB website. Netspend spokesman Cyle Mims said the company “supports smart regulation of our industry that promotes financial inclusion and empowerment for Americans, including those without access to traditional financial services.” The prepaid rule is new enough for lawmakers to repeal it under the Congressional Review Act, which allows them to wipe out recent regulations with simple majorities in both chambers and the president’s signature. A companion resolution was also introduced in the House of Representatives. Republicans hold the majority in both chambers. With time running out for Congress to repeal regulations from the administration of Democratic former President Barack Obama, Perdue recently took a procedural step to rush his resolution to the full Senate for a vote after the chamber returns from recess next week. In response, Allied Progress asked the CFPB to quickly provide a raft of documents encompassing communications from Perdue and other lawmakers during the three years the rule was drafted, as well as interactions with TSYS and Netspend. But the bureau said it could not meet the request expeditiously, and so Allied Progress filed suit with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to require the agency to produce the documents promptly. The CFPB declined to comment on the suit, but pointed to remarks its director, Richard Cordray, made while unveiling the final rule, where he said the rule “will give consumers easy-to-understand information about prepaid accounts right up front.” Providers of prepaid cards have said the rule’s requirements are complicated and expensive to implement. They say they sometimes need overdraft fees to cover risks associated with cards, which are also often issued in place of traditional paychecks to lower-income workers. Earlier this month, 18 states’ attorneys general from 18 states wrote to congressional leaders opposing the resolution that would overturn the new rule, saying overdraft penalties and undisclosed fees can put consumers in significant debt.

2018-07-28 00:00:00,2018,7.0,28,Using the internet without the Amazon Cloud,"Amazon servers make up so much of the internet that it can be hard to separate the two. As of last year, Amazon Web Services controlled roughly 40 percent of the cloud market, running the backend for Netflix, Pinterest, Slack and dozens of other services with no visible connection to the company. Because the Amazon partnership is rarely explicit, AWS becomes a kind of invisible infrastructure, like water mains, submarine cables, or any of the other hidden pipes we rely on without seeing. When AWS starts to fail — like it did in March and again in June — it can seem like the entire internet is collapsing. Unless you know which services in particular are running on AWS servers, you won’t know difference between an cloud failure and a submarine cable break. But that system doesn’t have to be invisible. Developer Dhruv Mehrotra has made a plug-in that will disconnect you from AWS entirely, using the system’s public IP list to block every connection to an Amazon server. Technically a MacOS port of an earlier tool for Linux, Mehrotra’s program lets you see what the internet would look if Amazon Web Services suddenly ceased to exist. The program lives on Github, so installing it requires a little Terminal-wrangling — but once you get it running, you’ll be in for a remarkable view of the internet at large. Entire services are missing, so you won’t be able to listen to Spotify, book a flight on Expedia, or look at rooms on Airbnb. Even where websites load, there may be holes punched out of them — missing images, embedded apps, or entire ad networks. It’s not something you’ll want to use for too long (the internet is better when it works, it turns out), but it’s a view that’s well worth taking in, if only to taste the sheer scope of Amazon’s server empire.",https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/28/17622792/plugin-use-the-internet-without-the-amazon-cloud,Tech,The Verge,technology,313
2018-02-27 16:39:00,2018,2.0,27,Fake Porn Makers Are Worried About Accidentally Making Child Porn,"Hiding in a .zip file among thousands of otherwise mundane images of Emma Watson’s face are a handful of photos of her as a child. This collection of images, or faceset, is used to train a machine learning algorithm to make a deepfake: a fake porn video that swaps Watson’s face onto a porn performer’s body, to make it look like she’s having sex on video. If someone uses the faceset that contains images of Watson as a child to make a deepfake, that means that a face of a minor was in part used to create a nonconsensual porn video.  The people making deepfakes and trading these facesets are worried about this. They write disclaimers that younger celebrities’ facesets might contain photos of them as minors. Some are deleting whole sets, such as one of Elle Fanning, until they can be sure it doesn't contain images of her as a minor. “I deleted all posts with Elle Fanning because it's impossible to prove that she was 18 years old in the old faceset,” user Anton wrote on one deepfakes forum. “It's better to be safe than sorry.”  In a deepfakes Discord server that was recently deleted by the platform, users discussed the possibility that facesets they were using to create fake porn videos contained images of celebrities as minors:  The images in one faceset are close-ups of Watson's face, which  The Sun previously traced to scenes in the early  Harry Potter movies, when Watson was around 10 years old. Motherboard also found several other facesets of Watson and Fanning that contained images of them as minors.  We don’t know how faces of minors end up in these datasets, but it's possible facial recognition software like Microsoft’s open-source FaceTracker and FaceDetector, which scan through videos and capture stills of a target's face, grabbed them by mistake. One of the Watson facesets, for example, also includes a close-up of actor Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, showing that these facesets contain other types of images that shouldn't be there. In 2003, Congress passed the PROTECT Act, which classified computer-generated child porn as obscene. In other words, one can be brought to court on an obscenity charge, not a child porn charge, for creating or possessing computer-generated child porn, where no actual children were involved in creating the pornography. A first-time offender convicted of producing child pornography faces up to 30 years in prison, while an obscenity charge carries a punishment of at least five years and up to a maximum of 20 years in prison. “The courts have ruled that if you take the face of child and put it on the body of an adult that is not protected speech,” Hany Farid, a professor of computer science at Dartmouth College told me in a phone conversation. “Not because of the harm to the child but because the child’s interests are at stake.”  Page Pate, an Atlanta, Georgia-based attorney, told me in an email that in the US, whether someone can be charged based on a few images of a minor within these facesets depends on whether the result actually appears to be a minor engaged in a sexually explicit conduct, per the definition of child pornography.  “But it probably wouldn't cover an image where the face is that of a child and the body was clearly that of an adult,” Pate said. “It's really a case by case determination, and it's somewhat subjective. But unless the body looks like a child's body, I doubt this would be prosecuted in the US.”  Sadly, the issue of virtual child porn isn’t new, but deepfakes, which crowdsources and automates the process of creating fake videos, makes that issue more complicated. “People have been pasting faces onto things for a long time, I don’t think that this being more technologically complicated would change that analysis,” Charles Duan, associate director of tech and innovation policy at the advocacy group R Street Institute think tank, told me on the phone. “It’s still just as bad.” ",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/evmkxa/ai-fake-porn-deepfakes-child-pornography-emma-watson-elle-fanning,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,668
2019-05-07 00:00:00,2019,5.0,7,"WHO issues warning as measles infects 34,000 in Europe this year","LONDON (Reuters) - More than 34,000 people across Europe caught measles in the first two months of 2019, with the vast majority of cases in Ukraine, the World Health Organization said on Tuesday as it urged authorities to ensure vulnerable people get vaccinated.  The death toll among 34,300 cases reported across 42 countries in the WHO’s European region reached 13, with the virus killing people in Ukraine - which is suffering a measles epidemic - as well as in Romania and Albania. The risk is that outbreaks may continue to spread, the WHO warned.  “If outbreak response is not timely and comprehensive, the virus will find its way into more pockets of vulnerable individuals and potentially spread to additional countries within and beyond the region,” it said in a statement.  “Every opportunity should be used to vaccinate susceptible children, adolescents and adults.”  Measles is a highly contagious disease that can kill and cause blindness, deafness or brain damage. It can be prevented with two doses of an effective vaccine, but - in part due to pockets of unvaccinated people - it is currently spreading in outbreaks in many parts of the world including in the United States, the Philippines and Thailand.  In Europe, the majority of measles cases so far in 2019 are in Ukraine, which saw more than 25,000 people infected in the first two months of the year.  There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, and vaccination is the only way to prevent it, the WHO said. Most cases are in unvaccinated or under-vaccinated people.   It added that even though the region had its highest ever estimated coverage for the second dose of measles vaccination in 2017 - at around 90 percent - some countries have had problems, including declining or stagnating immunization coverage in some cases, low coverage in some marginalized groups, and immunity gaps in older populations.  The WHO called on national health authorities across the region to focus efforts on ensuring all population groups have access to vaccines.  “The impact on public health will persist until the ongoing outbreaks are controlled,” it said, adding that health authorities should “identify who has been missed in the past and reach them with the vaccines they need.”  A report by the United Nations children’s fund UNICEF last month found that more than 20 million children a year missed out on measles vaccines across the world in the past eight years, laying the ground for dangerous outbreaks.

2018-08-21 09:00:06,2018,8.0,21,Amazon’s Ripple Effect on Grocery Industry: Rivals Stock Up on Start-Ups,"Chieh Huang spent years trying to get grocery industry executives excited about the technology at Boxed, his grocery e-commerce company. He regularly gave tours of the company’s state-of-the-art fulfillment centers, featuring a custom software system and roving bands of autonomous carts. But interest in Boxed, which is not profitable and crossed $100 million in revenue in 2016, was lukewarm. “They were like, ‘What a cute lemonade stand,’” Mr. Huang said. That changed a year ago when Amazon bought Whole Foods Market. The $13.4 billion deal shook the grocery world, setting off a frenzy of deals and partnerships that continues to intensify. Traditional retailers pursued digital technology, and online companies reconsidered their relationship with brick-and-mortar retail. Kroger announced a partnership with Ocado, an online grocery company, to use its robots to pack online orders. Target acquired Shipt, a start-up offering same-day delivery services, for $550 million. Walmart acquired Parcel, a start-up offering same-day delivery, and announced a partnership to use Alert Innovation, a small company that employs automated carts to fulfill grocery pickup orders at stores. And on Tuesday, Boxed announced that it had sold a minority stake to Aeon Group, one of the largest retail chains in Japan. Alongside investors including Alpha Square Group and CDIB Capital, Aeon invested $110 million in Boxed. The deal values the start-up at $600 million, according to a person familiar with the agreement. “Are technology folks like us going to figure out retail faster than the retailers figure out technology?” Mr. Huang asked. “In some ways we’re all kind of fighting the same fight against the gigantic folks online.” Food shopping is one of the last major holdouts to online retail. Groceries are unique in that their inventory is perishable, fragile and heavy. Grocery customers often shop at the last minute, like to see the food they are about to eat and don’t want to pay high delivery fees. Even Amazon, with its Amazon Fresh online grocery service, has struggled to gain ground in the business. The company’s Whole Foods deal, paired with Walmart’s 2016 acquisition of Jet.com, underscored that the future of selling food and household items requires cooperation between the digital natives and the old-school retailers. Grocery companies “are realizing that with Walmart and Amazon moving at their pace, you need to pick yours up, too,” said Greg Spragg, a former chief merchant at Sam’s Club, the wholesale retailer owned by Walmart, who now consults at GrowthWise Group. “I wouldn’t call it fear. I would call it a wake-up call.” Walmart, the nation’s largest grocer, declined to comment. Amazon did not provide a comment. Global food retailing is a $5 trillion business, and just 3 percent of the world’s grocery spending happened online last year, according to Forrester Research. Online grocery sales are expected to double over the next four years, reaching $334 billion by 2022. Market research conducted by Morgan Stanley in July found that 56 percent of consumers who were likely to order groceries online said they would most likely order from Amazon, compared with 14 percent who would go to a mass merchandiser and 10 percent who would use their local supermarket. Phil Lempert, a grocery industry analyst, predicted store closings for chains that do not evolve to meet the changing needs of customers. Stores offering curated selections, specialty items, cooking classes and the option to buy online and pick up in person will thrive, he said. “The bulk of stores — they haven’t been doing exciting things for a long time,” Mr. Lempert said. Josh Hix, chief executive of Plated, a meal kit start-up, said the Amazon-Whole Foods deal had immediately changed his discussions with grocery chains. Meal kit companies have a checkered record. But the grocery companies saw an opportunity to use Plated’s data and research on recipes and taste preferences. “The pace of follow-ups went from ‘This is interesting, and we’ll be in New York again in five months’ to ‘This is really interesting, and how’s tomorrow at 9 a.m. look for another call?’” he said. After years of not being taken seriously, “it was very cathartic.” Plated held deal conversations over the summer with “virtually everybody” in the industry, Mr. Hix said. In September, it sold to Albertsons, a large grocery chain. At the time, Albertsons’ chief executive, Bob Miller, said the deal was “the latest example of Albertsons Companies meeting our customers wherever and however they like to shop.” Mr. Huang also fielded numerous acquisition offers for Boxed, creating a harrowing few months. Most of the big grocers “have wanted to kill us, partner with us, invest in us or buy us — all probably in the course of the same conversation,” he said. Mr. Huang, who previously founded a gaming company that was sold to Zynga, decided that the opportunity was too good to sell now. He opted to take the investment from Aeon instead. The ownership structure allows Boxed to license its technology to its retail competitors in the United States as they try to become more digital. The company is in talks with 10 or so potential partners for various pieces of its technology. They include mobile app technology, personalization software, a packing algorithm that maximizes space in shipping boxes, software that tracks item expiration dates, order management software and warehouse robotics automation. Boxed, which is based in New York City and has about 250 full-time employees, sells food and other everyday essentials in bulk. It has built a sizable business supplying snacks and office goods to companies and also earns revenue selling ads to suppliers to promote their items in its e-commerce site and app. A shipment on a conveyor belt inside the Boxed warehouse. Jeenah Moon for The New York Times Mr. Huang spoke about the deal with Aeon from Boxed’s New Jersey fulfillment center, as a self-driving cart rolled around the corner and slid sideways toward a shelf, waiting for a worker to place a box of Pampers or a can of Planters on its back. Nearby, a three-story automated wall of plastic tubs rearranged itself, while workers dropped handwritten notes to customers into boxes before taping them shut. Grocery delivery is difficult to do affordably, but tech-driven efficiencies like those developed by Boxed, Amazon and others have forced change on the industry. “Consumers want convenience and will pay more for it,” said Michael Pachter, an equities analyst at Wedbush Securities. “Once they stop going to grocery stores,” he added, “grocery stores are going to have a problem.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/technology/amazon-grocery-boxed-aeon.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,1080
2018-12-17 00:00:00,2018,12.0,17,Serious kidney injury common during cancer chemotherapy,"(Reuters Health) - - Nearly one in 10 cancer patients treated with chemotherapy or newer targeted drugs may be hospitalized for serious kidney injury, a Canadian study suggests. The study involved roughly 163,000 patients who started chemotherapy or targeted therapies for a new cancer diagnosis in Ontario from 2007 to 2014. Overall, 10,880 were hospitalized with serious kidney damage or for dialysis. This translated into a cumulative acute kidney injury rate of 9.3 percent, the study found. People with advanced tumors were 41 percent more likely to have acute kidney injuries than patients with early-stage cancer. Compared to the group as a whole, individuals who already had chronic kidney disease were 80 percent more likely to be hospitalized for a kidney injury, and people with diabetes had a 43 percent greater chance. “Patients should be aware that kidney injury can result during cancer treatment - both due to cancer itself and the drugs used to treat it,” said lead study author Dr. Abhijat Kitchlu of the University of Toronto. Many medicines that treat tumors are removed from the body by the kidneys and can damage certain cells within the kidneys, Kitchlu said by email. “It may be possible to reduce the risk of acute kidney injury by maintaining good hydration and in some cases, avoiding other drugs that can increase risk to the kidneys,” Kitchlu added. Medications that can damage the kidneys include ibuprofen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs), certain blood pressure medicines, and diuretics. In fact, in the study, older patients taking water pills or certain heart medications were also at higher risk for serious kidney problems. “Patients should seek early medical attention when concerned about dehydration or infection, as the symptoms related to kidney injury (decreased urine output, swelling, nausea, fatigue or confusion) may only occur after the kidneys have been damaged,” Kitchlu advised. In the current study, patients were more than twice as likely to develop acute kidney problems within the first 90 days of starting cancer treatment than they were later on, researchers report in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Patients who are already at high risk of kidney damage because of health problems like diabetes may be able to take cancer drugs that are less likely to damage the kidneys, said Leah Siskind, of the University of Louisville Medical School in Kentucky. “However, these less nephrotoxic chemotherapeutics are often less effective at reducing tumor burden,” Siskind, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. Patients at high risk for kidney damage should discuss alternative drugs or doses with their physicians to see if they can treat tumors in a way that minimizes their chance of kidney injury, advised Dr. Laura Cosmai of San Carlo Borromeo Hospital in Milan, Italy. And all patients should be on the alert for potential warning signs of kidney problems like dehydration, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, Cosmai, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. Vigilance is important because “cancer patients who develop acute kidney injury during treatment do have reduced survival odds,” Cosmai said.

Karma says it’s introducing the device in response to “growing customer needs,” and referenced the US Senate voting to remove privacy protections in March, allowing internet providers to sell your surfing habits. “Karma is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers, even in the face of these regulatory challenges. Getting or staying ‘off the grid,’ in terms of surfing the public internet, is more and more important to people who believe that being online should not mean giving up their right to lawful private activity,” said Todd Wallace, CEO of Karma Mobility in a statement. “Karma Black has been engineered to create anonymity for users.” Karma is unique because the hotspot is not locked down with a network password, so anyone in your area can connect to the hotspot and sign in to their Karma account to get online. The owner of the hotspot then receives credit for each person they ""share"" the hotspot with, either in the form of extra data that they can use later or cash credit to their account. Karma offers monthly subscription services and pay as you go options for data. In June 2016, Karma introduced a private tier that works more like a traditional hotspot. Karma says it’s been working for many months on Black, and noted that platform upgrades, including new partner services and applications, will be announced later in August. The company says a hardware upgrade program will be available for users who already own the $200 Go device. The company hasn’t disclosed how much the new Black hotspot will cost.

2019-11-05 00:00:00,2019,11.0,5,Facebook to expand encryption drive despite warnings over crime,"LISBON (Reuters) - Facebook will outline on Wednesday plans to expand encryption across its Messenger platform, despite warnings from regulators and government officials that the enhanced security will help protect pedophiles and other criminals. Executives told Reuters they will also detail safety measures, including stepped-up advisories for recipients of unwanted content. The moves follow complaints by top law enforcement officials in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia that Facebook’s plan to encrypt messaging on all its platforms would put child sex predators and pornographers beyond detection. The changes, supported by civil rights groups and many technology experts, will be more fully described by company executives at a Lisbon tech conference later in the day. Facebook messaging privacy chief Jay Sullivan and other executives said the company would press ahead with the changes while more carefully scrutinizing the data that it collects. Sullivan plans to call attention to a little-publicized option for end-to-end encryption that already exists on Messenger. The firm hopes increased usage will give the company more data to craft additional safety measures before it makes private chats the default setting. “This is a good test bed for us,” Sullivan said. “It’s part of the overarching direction.” The company will also post more on its pages for users about how the Secret Conversations function works. The feature has been available since 2016 but is not easy to find and takes extra clicks to activate. The company is also considering banning new Messenger accounts not linked to regular Facebook profiles. The vast majority of Messenger accounts are associated with Facebook profiles but a greater proportion of stand-alone accounts are used for crime and unwelcome communications, executives said. “We’re considering a registration process where prospective Messenger users will only be able to sign up for Messenger by creating or logging into a Facebook account,” a Facebook spokesperson said. Requiring a link to Facebook would reduce the privacy protections of those Messenger users but give the company more information it could use to warn or block troublesome accounts or report suspected crimes to police. The enhanced safety measures the company plans include sending reminders to users to report unwanted contacts and inviting recipients of unwanted content to send plain-text versions of the chats to Facebook to ban senders or potentially report them to police. Facebook might also send more prompts to users reached by people with no shared friends or who have had many messages or friend requests rejected. Facebook had previously said it wanted to ease user reporting of misconduct as it gradually moves toward more encryption, but it has given few details.

A 56-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder at a company in the northwestern town of Schloss Holte-Stukenbrock, said the police in nearby Bielefeld, where the man lives. Police did not name the suspect. He was seen on a security camera opening a co-worker's lunchbox and putting a substance on the sandwich inside, the police said in a statement. A small bottle of ""powdery substance"" was found in the suspect's bag after he was taken into custody, police said.  The sandwich's owner had raised the alarm earlier after discovering an unknown substance smeared on his lunch. He informed his company's management, who in turn notified police.  Testing by the regional criminal office of North Rhine-Westphalia indicated the substance on the bread was toxic lead acetate, and there was enough to cause severe organ damage, authorities said.  The accused was brought before a judge on May 17, who issued an arrest warrant for attempted murder. Fire brigade specialists found mercury, lead and cadmium in the suspect's apartment in Bielefeld. Police said the man ""has long tried to produce toxic substances, including heavy metal compounds,"" based on substances found in his home.  Authorities broadened the investigation after two other cases of illness at the company in recent years were discovered. Officials are also now re-examining all deaths connected to the company since 2000 -- and in particular, 21 former employees who died before retirement -- to see if heavy metal poisoning played a part.  ""There were a strikingly high number of heart attacks and cancers among the death cases in the company,"" the police statement said. Police said they will question relatives and former physicians, and review medical records. It's possible the bodies might have to be exhumed. Police said they know of no possible motive.

2017-01-29 22:00:00,2017,1.0,29,NASA's Groundbreaking New Development in Rocket Science Is … Paint?,"Paint probably isn't the first thing that comes to mind when you think of rocket science, but NASA's Ames Research Center has discovered it can use paint to identify the parts of rockets that are being overly buffeted by pressure as they zip toward supersonic speed. Specifically, it's ""Unsteady Pressure Sensitive Paint"" that reacts with oxygen to create light, causing the parts of the rocket under the most duress to shine bright red in simulations. By studying those points, they can refine their designs to minimize or eliminate those problem spots in order to keep the craft or rocket from breaking up. The paint isn't actually used on real rockets. Instead, the pinkish substance is lightly painted over a scale model, which is then set up in a wind tunnel that mimics the intense atmospheric pressures on a real spacecraft or aircraft. NASA has used pressure sensitive paint in the past, but it wasn't effective as it could be as it only measured averages over time.  With the new ""unsteady"" paint, however, researchers can see the fluctuations from buffeting in far greater and faster detail when they're monitored under ultraviolet light with multiple high-speed cameras. When the resulting data are compiled, the areas enduring less pressure than average appear blue and the most affected parts shine red.  ""We learned from this test that this method is what you need to study buffet,"" said Jim Ross, one of the two scientists at Ames heading the project, along with Jayanta Panda.""There's a lot we don't understand about unsteady flow that this paint will help us figure out."" It doesn't even look much different than standard pressure sensitive paint, but up close it's filled with pores that allow the air flowing down the sides of the model to interact with a greater area of paint. The pores cause oxygen to react much more quickly with the paint, which produces more accurate images of the potentially damages forces. For all the thought that went into creating it, it's a fairly simple procedure that could greatly minimize the costs of future testing. By contrast, the traditional method of measuring buffeting forces on rockets involves hooking up to 400 tiny microphones to a model and running it through a wind tunnel. Not only is this approach much more time-consuming and expensive, but it doesn't even cover the full surface of the model as the Unsteady pressure sensitive paint does.

2018-11-09 00:00:00,2018,11.0,9,Conjoined twins: Bhutanese girls separated after six-hour surgery in Australia," (CNN)Conjoined twins who flew nearly 6,000 miles for a life-changing operation have been separated by doctors in Australia.  The 15-month-old twin girls, Nima and Dawa Pelden, were joined at the stomach and had grown up facing each other, unable to move independently.  Dr. Joe Crameri, head of pediatric surgery at Melbourne Royal Children's Hospital, said Friday that the surgery was a ""relief"" and a ""joy."" ""There is nothing better in any operation than to be able to go to the parents and say, 'we've been able to look after your child,' "" he said. ""I feel confident that they will be able to recover from this and go forward."" The twins were flown from their home in Bhutan to Australia on October 2 for the operation.  The delicate procedure took place over six hours and involved about 25 surgeons, nurses and anesthetists, according to CNN affiliate 9 News. Crameri said there were no surprises, despite concerns that the girls' bowel may have been conjoined.  ""We were very fortunate in that there wasn't any significant bowel attachment and while it was all swimming next to one another it wasn't actually connected in any major way,"" Crameri said. He said that the girls' mother was ""very grateful for everything"" the doctors were able to do. 'They're getting cranky' Funds for the girls' operation, which estimated to cost about $180,000 (250,000 AUD), according to 9 News, was raised by Children First Foundation, a Melbourne-based nonprofit.  ""Mom said the girls are getting a little bit frustrated with each other, as you would at 14 months,"" the charity's CEO Elizabeth Lodge said last month. ""Like any siblings, they're getting cranky, so mom's really looking forward to the operation happening sooner rather than later."" The formerly conjoined McDonald twins' amazing journey home Born via caesarean section last year, the girls are believed to be Bhutan's first conjoined twins.  As well as the issues with mobility and comfort, Lodge said the twins had recently been losing weight, which had been a concern to doctors who are now observing them closely.  Several members of the surgical team had worked on the operation to separate conjoined Bangladeshi twins Trishna and Krishna in 2009.  They were separated after a marathon 27-hour surgery, despite doctors initially giving them only a 25% chance of making it.  Difficult surgery   Conjoined twins occur once every 200,000 live births, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. About 70% are female, and they are always identical twins.  Scientists believe that conjoined twins develop from a single fertilized egg that fails to separate completely as it divides. ""Although two fetuses will develop from this embryo, they will remain physically connected -- most often at the chest, abdomen or pelvis. Conjoined twins may also share one or more internal organs,"" according to the Mayo Clinic.  ""The success of surgery depends on where the twins are joined and how many and which organs are shared, as well as the experience and skill of the surgical team.""  They were previously commonly referred to as ""Siamese twins,"" a name that originated with Eng and Chang Bunker, a set of conjoined twins who were born in Siam (now Thailand) in 1811. They lived to age 63 and appeared in traveling exhibitions. Chang and Eng both married and fathered a total of 21 children between them. While separation surgeries of twins joined at the abdomen and other parts of their bodies, twins joined at the head are at a far greater risk.  The case of two US boys joined at the top of their skulls attracted global attention in 2016 as doctors successfully operated to separate them.

2017-08-03 00:00:00,2017,8.0,3,Popular teen app Monkey turning into Chatroulette 2.0,"You may not have heard of Monkey, but there's a good chance your teenager has. Monkey is a video-chat app for iPhone and iPad, and connects users around the world with like-minded individuals for 10-second video chats using their Snapchat usernames. If you make a connection, you could have a friend on social media, which can be as important as real life. ""I think people, adults especially, there's a real disconnect realizing Internet friends are just as important to teens as real world friends,"" Monkey co-founder Isaiah Turner said. That may be one reason why the app has taken off among the younger set: In April, it was the top iOS app downloaded, according to analytics firm App Annie. The app was meant to be an updated version of random video-chat site Chatroulette for today's teens, but without the sexually explicit content. Turner and his team developed artificial intelligence technology that would help detect inappropriate content, along with tools to allow users to report it. But a brief time on the app revealed the same issues that brought down Chatroulette after a brief period of massive popularity in 2010. Among the 25 users CNBC chatted with, one was engaging in a sexually explicit act while another was showing off his genitals. ""I'm sorry that you experienced explicit content,"" Turner said. ""To clarify, however, the machine learning and human monitoring kicks in when a user is reported. The activity is monitored and then if the inappropriate content is confirmed, the user is banned. In the version of Monkey that will launch with iOS11, the machine learning will kick in before the user is even reported. Monkey is taking this seriously and being proactive to solve it."" Topics you can chat about on Monkey Monkey has been downloaded almost three million times since it launched in November 2016, according to mobile app analytics company App Annie, and averaged 300,000 monthly active users during Q2 of 2017. (Monkey claims its actual usage is much higher, in the millions.) It's particularly popular among teens and young adults. According to App Annie, Monkey was the number-one app downloaded by 13-to-24 year-olds in April, and has remained in the top 10 ever since. Currently, it's the ninth most popular app among that age group. The average user is 23, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower, and it's pretty evenly split between female and male users -- 48 to 52 percent. (Monkey says that the average age of its users is only 17.) Monkey is the brainchild of Turner and co-founder Ben Pasternak. The two met years ago as most kids these days do: on the Internet. They finally met in person at Apple's app developer conference, WWDC, in 2015. Soon after, Pasternak was calling Turner with the idea for Monkey, a way to create a community of teens where they could meet people or find others with shared interests. ""Chatroulette wasn't a very inspiring place,"" said Turner. ""We didn't want to create anything like that. They had a terrible community. You didn't meet people you had a lot of in common with."" Turner and Pasternak aren't just your average teens with an idea. When he was 15, Pasternak received a round of venture capital from Binary Capital for a social app known as Flogg. When Turner received the call for Monkey, he was working at Washington DC-personalized retail offer startup PreciseTarget, doing back end and front end development. He was 17. Turner's love for coding started when he was 11, he claims. By 12, he was hacking his friends' TV cable boxes to remove any parental blocks. ""I started reverse-engineering how it worked,"" he said. ""Whenever they [parents] would put parental controls, I would turn off in a few hours."" His most notorious hack to date was when he found a security flaw in Yo, the viral app that let you send a simple message -- ""Yo"" -- to your friends. He managed to get a push notification that said ""#YoBeenHacked"" to its users. As a result, Yo developer Or Arbel hired Turner. He dropped out of high school at 15 to take the opportunity. ""My parents didn't help me to drop out, but once it finally happened they supported my decision,"" Turner admitted. ""If I hadn't done it I wouldn't have started Monkey, and Monkey is one of the best things that happened."" A 10-second Monkey chat with a 24-year-old in Pakistan (face blurred for privacy) To avoid the issues with its predecessor, Monkey employees – who have an average age of 18 – built AI to detect inappropriate content, Turner says. There are also tools to report people. Once reported, the AI scans the chat, according to Turner. If it detects any explicit content, the user is banned automatically. ""Our biggest focus when we built it from day one we wanted to create a community without inappropriate content,"" Turner said. ""To do that, we had to create neural network machine learning capable of within seconds finding anything inappropriate."" In addition, users are required to submit their age before they use the app, but there's no way to verify that you are how old you say you are either. (Turner points out that no other social network can verify age either.)But some users are slipping through the cracks. Turner says the company is working on it. ""Interestingly, it's not teenagers who tend to perpetuate explicit behavior; it's adults,"" he said. ""Teenagers are using the space for its intent: connection to internet friends."" He also noted other apps dealt with the same issues, but were able to prevent inappropriate content as they matured. ""In the early days of Snapchat, people tended to use it to send nudes,"" Turner noted. ""Over time it became what it is today, a place for self expression.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/03/popular-teen-app-monkey-turning-into-chatroulette-2-point-0.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,966

Jeremy Gardner is a co-founder of the Crypto Castle, initially both a home and the headquarters of start-up Augur, a decentralized prediction market platform. ""We didn't have the money for all the salaries to pay everyone to go live on their own so it was much cheaper to keep everyone in one place, eradicate housing costs and still be in San Francisco,"" said Gardner. From there the house grew, with a rotating cast of crypto-currency entrepreneurs as tenants, and became a crash pad for visitors. Self-driving car start-up Comma.ai was created in the basement, with CEO George Hotz living in a closet right off the main room. Eventually, the company raised several million dollars in funding, and he moved out. Gardner said one of his ""favorite nights"" happened when Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin was crashing there and got into discussions with BitTorrent founder Bram Cohen.

2019-08-05 16:35:07,2019,8.0,5,What Experts Know About People Who Commit Mass Shootings,"There may be as many motivations as there are killers. But over the decades, scientists have seen some patterns emerge. On Monday morning, President Trump made his first televised statement about the mass murders committed over the weekend in El Paso, Tex., and Dayton, Ohio. He called for action to “stop mass killings before they start,” citing what he said were a number contributing factors: the contagious nature of mass murder; the glorification of violence in video games; and the need to act on “red flags” to identify and potentially confine the “mentally ill monsters” that he said commit the crimes. Many of these factors have been studied by scientists for decades. Here are answers to some of the most common questions about the causes of mass murder. Yes. The police find abundant evidence that shooters have studied previous crimes, often mimicking gestures or killing tactics, as if in homage to previous killers. This is true both of younger shooters who mow down unarmed people in schools, or at random; and of older men who execute innocents in the name of an ideology — be it opposition to immigration, white supremacy, radical Islam or another extreme belief. The young man who slaughtered elementary school children and teachers in Sandy Hook, Conn., had studied the Columbine massacre, among many others. The man who shot to death 50 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., had studied a previous attack, in San Bernardino, Calif. In both cases, the murderers cited radical Islam as justification. The young man accused of shooting to death more than 20 adults and children in a Walmart in El Paso, Tex., over the weekend had seen the video posted by the man who gunned down unarmed worshipers at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Forensic psychologists say that many would-be mass killers see themselves as part of a brotherhood of like-minded, isolated and resentful boys and men. To them, previous mass murderers may be perceived as idols and pioneers. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The results of studies attempting to clarify the relationship between violent video games and aggression have been mixed, with experts deeply divided on the findings. A just-published analysis of the research to date concludes that “in the vast majority of settings, violent video games do increase aggressive behavior” — but that “these effects are almost always quite small.” The “aggression” in question falls well short of assault with a weapon, never mind mass murder. So the weight of scientific opinion is that video games are not a decisive factor when a spree killer decides to act. Establishing a persuasive link between shooting digital figures from the couch and real people in a mall or school is a long shot. A huge proportion of males in the United States have played or are playing video games; only a handful commit mass murders. And video games are even more popular in Asian countries, where mass killings are far rarer. Tenuous, at best. People who blame mass shootings on “the mentally ill” are usually reasoning backward from the act itself: the person just shot 20 unarmed strangers, so he must be “crazy.” In fact, scientists find that only a small fraction of people with persistent mental distress are more likely than average to commit violent acts: patients with paranoid schizophrenia, which is characterized by delusional thinking and often so-called command hallucinations — frightening voices identifying threats where none exist. People living in this kind of misery are far more likely to be the victims of violence than perpetrators; but they can act violently themselves, especially when using drugs or alcohol. The clearest recent example is Jared Loughner, the college student who opened fire at an event in Tucson, Ariz., hosted by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in 2011, killing six and wounding 13. Mr. Loughner’s online posts demonstrated increasing drug use and paranoid fantasies. About one in five mass murderers shows evidence of psychosis, according to Dr. Michael Stone, a forensic psychiatrist who maintains data on some 350 murderers going back more than a century. The other 80 percent have many of the problems that nearly everyone has to manage at some point in life: anger, isolation, depressive moods, resentments, jealousy. No one knows for certain. In his speech, Mr. Trump mentioned the teenager who in 2018 killed 17 people a high school in Parkland, Fla. It’s a good example: Before his murder spree, the shooter talked of his intentions to such an extent that classmates joked that he was the student most likely to shoot up the school. “Unfortunately, it is wishful thinking to believe that there is a simple set of warning signs, a phone app or a checklist which can be used to identify a mass shooter,” said Dr. Deborah Weisbrot, director of the outpatient clinic of child and adolescent psychiatry at Stony Brook University. She has interviewed about 200 young people, mostly teenage boys, who have made threats. “There is no specific ‘profile’ of a shooter, as is still often sometimes assumed — there have been both male and female shooters, and different socioeconomic backgrounds,” she said. Red-flag policies, tracking threats and other signs of trouble, have been in place for years in some school districts around the country. Would-be shooters often reveal their intentions in dark asides or rants online. They may profess respect for past mass killers even as they stockpile weapons and ammunition. Los Angeles County, in particular, has intervened in scores of such cases since its program was implemented in 2007. It has not had a major school shooting, though there is no way to know if the program has prevented any. Still, such preventive measures get students into therapy, and alert parents and teachers to warning signs: they do not require forced drugging and confinement before any crime has been committed. Implementing that kind of policy would require a thoughtful reconsideration of individual rights in this country — which, given partisan gridlock, is not likely to happen.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/health/mass-shootings-mental-health.html,health,The New York Times,health,1008
2019-09-04 00:00:00,2019,9.0,4,"Porsche Taycan revealed: $150,900 base price, 0-60 mph in 3 seconds ","Porsche has finally unveiled its first all-electric car. After four years of concepts, name changes, spy shots, teases, and drips of information about the four-door EV, the German automaker revealed the production version of the Taycan electric sports car on Wednesday during an event that took place simultaneously on three continents. Originally dubbed “Mission E” when it was announced as a concept car in 2015, the Taycan will begin its production life as two variants: the Taycan Turbo and the Taycan Turbo S, which run a staggering $150,900 and $185,000, respectively. Both are all-wheel drive machines, and both go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in three seconds or less. (Both are also likely to spark arguments about the use of the word “turbo” in the name, even though trying to stop semantic drain is a useless endeavor.) More variants of the Taycan, like less powerful rear-wheel drive versions or the Cross Turismo crossover that Porsche has shown off in concept form, will follow the two Turbos. Porsche didn’t share an EPA-estimated range for its first EV, though these higher-end versions are expected to travel somewhere near 300 miles on a full charge. (The automaker did cite a European estimate of 450 kilometers, which would equal about 280 miles.) Both initial versions of the Taycan will use a dual-electric-motor setup to put out the equivalent of 616 horsepower. The Taycan Turbo will make 670 horsepower in the special get-off-the-line-quickly “launch control” mode, while the Turbo S can put down 750 horsepower in that mode. The result is that the Taycan Turbo can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in three seconds flat, while the Turbo S will make that same run in 2.6 seconds. The two Taycan Turbos draw their energy from a 93kWh battery pack that weighs in at 1,389 pounds. In all, both cars weigh just a touch over 5,100 pounds, which is just a few pounds lighter than the current version of Tesla’s Model X SUV, and a few hundred pounds heavier than the Tesla Model S sedan. All told, that means the first Porsche Taycans will cost more than Tesla’s offerings, but they will just about keep pace with the Silicon Valley automaker’s top-tier cars. (It will also leave its German counterparts’ EVs in the dust in both categories.) The Taycan keeps pace with a top speed of 161 mph, as compared to Tesla Model S and X performance 163 mph top speed (thanks to a recent over-the-air software update). Porsche is also touting the Taycan’s ability to repeatedly launch off the line without overheating the battery pack, something that most modern EVs aren’t really built for. One thing Porsche is counting on to move Taycans (beyond the brand name itself), is the thing Porsche has touted most during the four-year tease of its first EV: the fact that the car’s massive battery packs can charge rapidly. Thanks to the 800-volt technology that Porsche is using in the Taycan, both variants can be charged from 5 percent to 80 percent in just under 23 minutes when hooked up to chargers that can charge at 270kW. (Porsche has promised to build charging stations capable of 350kW charging at its dealerships, and parent company Volkswagen has begun building out a network of chargers in North America that can handle up to 350kW charging.) These details help fill out the picture Porsche’s been painting of the Taycan, which is: it’s an EV that will offer supercar performance without forcing buyers to make sacrifices on practicality. Last month, the German automaker showed off the first photos of the inside of its first EV, revealing a typically Porsche interior, though one with more screens and touch-sensitive panels than usual. The Taycan will also be the first car with a built-in Apple Music app. Buyers of similarly specced performance cars usually have to sacrifice some comfort, but Porsche is promising deep-pocketed Taycan buyers will get a future-facing (but still premium) version of the cabin experience the company’s luxury sports cars are known for. Porsche has said it wants to offer versions of the Taycan that cost under $100,000. But even if or when that happens, the car is never going to be a mass-market sensation. Instead, it’s meant to be the most aspirational electric car in parent company Volkswagen’s impending (and imposing) stable of electric cars. Wednesday’s event didn’t answer every question that potential buyers or outright Porsche fans might have about the company’s first electric car. But it did answer just how aspirational Porsche wants the Taycan to be.

2019-07-24 00:00:00,2019,7.0,24,Roku is testing its own Wi-Fi extender to improve streaming reliability,"Roku is making a Wi-Fi extender called the Roku Relay, which is meant to improve wireless connections inside a home and improve reliability while streaming. The device, which has not yet been announced, is currently in testing with users outside the company, a person familiar with the tests tells The Verge. The Relay is a small white gadget that plugs into a power outlet and rests alongside the wall. Instructions show that it’s meant to be used with Roku devices to improve their Wi-Fi connection; it isn’t stated whether other devices can be connected to it, too. The product is seemingly being marketed as an extension of Roku players, with the manual directing people to install the Relay halfway between their router and TV. A product launch doesn’t appear to be imminent. Though the hardware is ready for testing, it’s yet to pass through the Federal Communications Commission’s clearance process, which it’ll have to in order to make it to market. Bloomberg, which first reported the device’s existence, said that Roku remains undecided on whether the product will even go on sale. A Roku spokesperson said the company doesn’t “comment on rumors or speculation.” Roku has only recently started to expand beyond its core offering of streaming media players. Last year, the company launched a pair of wireless speakers designed to be used with Roku TVs. That’s it for now, though. The Relay would be Roku’s second device beyond streaming sticks, boxes, and TVs (which the company doesn’t make itself). Despite being best known for its streaming devices, hardware sales only represented around one-tenth of Roku’s profits last year. For the most part, Roku’s income comes from ads, subscriptions, sales, and other services that happen on its devices after they’ve been purchased. Last year, Roku CEO Anthony Wood told The Verge that those services are what support the overall business. “That’s not paid for by the hardware. That’s paid for by our ad and content business,” he said. Like the wireless speakers, the Relay would give Roku another piece of hardware to sell to existing customers, helping to expand its hardware business. One analyst firm projects Wi-Fi extenders to become a $2 billion market by 2023, and they’re already becoming increasingly popular through mesh Wi-Fi systems. While those systems would render something like the Relay unnecessary, they aren’t yet present in most people’s homes. As a turnkey solution for patchy internet, the Relay could be an easy sell to customers who already trust their Roku.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707513/roku-relay-wifi-extender-leak-testing,Tech,The Verge,technology,415
2020-03-02 00:00:00,2020,3.0,2,"10,000 UK railway users had details leaked by free Wi-Fi provider","A free Wi-Fi service at rail stations in the UK exposed the personal information of about 10,000 people, and the provider did not notify authorities because it considered the situation “low-risk,” the BBC reports. Email addresses, dates of birth and travel information were among the details visible in an unprotected database from provider C3UK, which was discovered by security researcher Jeremiah Fowler. Affected stations included Harlow Mill, Chelmsford, Colchester, Waltham Cross, Burnham, Norwich, and London Bridge, according to the BBC. C3UK told the BBC that it secured the database, created between November 28th and February 12th, as soon as Fowler notified the company. C3UK did not notify the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), because it said the data had not been stolen or accessed by a third party. The ICO is the UK’s independent regulatory agency that oversees data privacy issues. “Given the database did not contain any passwords or other critical data such as financial information, this was identified as a low-risk potential vulnerability,” the company said.  But the ICO told the BBC that it would expect an organization “to consider whether it is appropriate to contact the people affected and to consider whether there are steps that can be taken to protect them from any potential adverse effects.” Fowler said the database was searchable by user name, which could have allowed anyone with access to track the travel patterns of the people whose information was included. Network Rail, which manages London Bridge station, said it “strongly suggested” to C3UK that the vulnerability be reported, but told the BBC, “We have been assured by our supplier that this was a low-risk issue and the integrity of people’s information remains fully secure.” Greater Anglia, which runs some of the other affected stations, said it no longer uses C3UK as its free Wi-Fi provider.",https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161387/uk-railway-stations-free-wi-fi-exposed-london-bridge,Tech,The Verge,technology,302
2016-01-15 14:37:00,2016,1.0,15,"Ross Ulbricht Appeals Silk Road Conviction, Omits Theory That FBI Hacked Servers","The biggest and weirdest question left in the Silk Road story is probably never going to get answered. Ross Ulbricht—also known as the Dread Pirate Roberts, operator of the Silk Road marketplace—is appealing his conviction, for which he serving a life sentence, to the Second Circuit. Yet his appeal brief is missing any reference to the mysterious seizure of the Silk Road Icelandic servers.  The appeal brief clocks out at 170 pages, with an additional six appendices—a total of 1,794 pages. Don't worry, it's not just you: that really is kind of a lot.  To be fair, this whole saga is really complicated. Even beyond the fairly technical aspects, it's an extremely twisted case. There are drugs. There are bitcoins. There are corrupt undercover agents making sockpuppet accounts on a Tor-hidden service. There are five faked murders-for-hire.  There's just… a lot. But bizarrely, the brief still leaves something out. Back in 2014, one of the Silk Road defense attorneys, Joshua Horowitz, noted that the FBI's seizure of the Silk Road servers in Iceland was still unexplained, because the government's explanation of how they had found the servers was actually technically impossible.  This turned into fodder for conspiracy theories. Did the government illegally hack Tor in order to get at the Silk Road servers? Did the identification of Ross Ulbricht start with a tip-off from the NSA? It seems wild, but it's no crazier than the rest of this case already is.  But anything regarding the Icelandic servers is curiously missing from the appeal. Most of the appeal brief focuses on two corrupt agents who really made a mess out of the Silk Road investigation in Baltimore.  Two Rotten Apples in a Barrel That Was Totally Separate From This Investigation, We Swear  The appeal brief brings up a total of seven issues—including an argument that Ulbricht's life sentence is unreasonable—but much of the actual space in the quite lengthy document is taken up by the weird, wild, and troubling story of Carl Mark Force and Shaun Bridges.  These two law enforcement agents were recently sentenced to 6 ½ years and 5 years, 11 months respectively. Force and Bridges—separately, apparently without knowing about the others' crimes—orchestrated massive thefts, scams, and blackmail using their privileged positions as law enforcement agents in the Silk Road Task Force. Bridges in particular stole 20,000 bitcoins from the Dread Pirate Roberts, and then set up a cooperating witness for the crime. DPR commissioned a hit on the cooperating witness. The hitman he hired turned out to be the undercover Carl Force. Apparently under the direction of their supervisors, Force and Bridges faked the murder of the cooperating witness, and even sent DPR doctored ""proof of death"" photos.  None of this made it into the New York trial. The reasons were twofold. First, the New York prosecution against Ross Ulbricht didn't include the conspiracy to murder the cooperating witness. Instead, a separate indictment in Maryland addressed that charge.  Second, a grand jury investigation into Force and Bridges was still under seal—which meant that the Ulbricht defense team couldn't talk about the two corrupt agents at all.  It's important to note that the government had Ross Ulbricht's laptop, which contained a diary, chat transcripts, accounting spreadsheets, and even a complete copy of the Silk Road website. They connected portions of the diary and the chat transcripts to emails on his personal Gmail account (rossulbricht@gmail.com) and posts on his Facebook account. They even trotted out a college friend of Ross Ulbricht to testify that he had helped him code the website in the beginning.  It is an understatement to say that the government's case was quite strong.  And the defense's theory of the case at trial came under fire from observers for, well, overall plausibility. Their theory was that Mark Karpeles, a CEO of a bitcoin company, had hacked Ross Ulbricht through a Bittorrent client that was downloading an episode of the Colbert Report. Karpeles then planted the diary, the chat transcripts, and other files onto Ulbricht's computer, thus setting him up as the fall guy.  The jury apparently didn't buy it, and convicted Ulbricht on all counts.  It's not like Force and Bridges were the key to catching Ross Ulbricht—what we know tends to show that they were really good at undermining the investigation, but not very good at uncovering real evidence. When it comes down to it, the big thing about Force and Bridges is that their complete omission from the trial just feels kind of weird and bad.  It's more than possible that the jury would have still convicted Ulbricht, even if they had been able to hear evidence about the horrifying mess inside the Silk Road investigation. The point is, even if justice was served, it still feels really unfair.  Whatever Happened to the Icelandic Servers?  The defense moved to suppress a whole lot of evidence prior to trial, based on the theory that the FBI's seizure of the Icelandic server was illegal. The defense couldn't quite prove it, but something didn't add up, and surely it was worth getting to the bottom of it.  Indeed, technical experts such as Nicholas Weaver and Rob Graham agreed: something was wrong with the FBI's account of how the servers were first found.  The government claimed that the Silk Road's CAPTCHA had been misconfigured, and that that had led them the Silk Road's IP address. But traffic logs from the Silk Road servers didn't corroborate the story, and when the defense asked for additional information, like the government's own traffic logs, or exactly what kind of software the FBI had been using, they claimed they didn't have any records.  It was pretty weird.  But here's the problem: a Fourth Amendment inquiry into whether a search is legal or illegal begins with whether or not the defendant has a personal privacy interest in what was searched or seized. Ross Ulbricht would have had to declare a personal privacy interest in the Icelandic servers in order to even go down the Fourth Amendment rabbit hole. In a way, he was going to have to 'fess up to being DPR in order to get acquitted of being DPR.'  Maybe it would have worked out. Declaring a personal privacy interest in something isn't exactly the same as saying you're the dude, but Ulbricht apparently decided not to tempt fate. Legally speaking, the whole issue was extremely thorny. The server was physically abroad, in Iceland, and also rented from a third-party service—facts that complicated Ulbricht's Fourth Amendment rights, if any.  So the defense refused to declare a personal privacy interest in the server. And now, despite devoting 170 pages to other issues, the defense has decided not to appeal the trial court's ruling that they had to declare a personal privacy interest in the first place.  In other words, we're probably never going to find out what actually happened with the Icelandic servers. Regardless of whether the Second Circuit takes up Ross Ulbricht's appeal, the biggest unsolved mystery in the Silk Road case will remain unanswered.

""Most advertisers still aren't comfortable with Facebook Live, and this recent news won't help,"" branding agency DiMassimo Goldstein CEO Mark DiMassimo said. ""Facebook's great strength has been unprecedented power and efficiency of targeting, and advertisers trust the company to deliver sophisticated solutions to challenging problems. Many advertisers are still looking at Facebook Live, and want to see more vetting, and more reassurance of brand safety."" Authorities in Ohio are searching for Steve Stephens, who recorded and uploaded a video of him allegedly killing an elderly man on Sunday according to NBC News. Police initially said the content was streamed through Facebook Live, but later said that the video was pre-recorded. However, Stephens did use Facebook Live on Sunday, as well as said in other posts and at least one other video he had killed other people, police said. Marketing agency Attention still will consider using Facebook Live for its clients, but being broadcast next to criminal content is something it thinks about. ""There's an expectation as an advertiser that your content will be served up in an appropriate environment, safe from improper and even damaging content,"" said marketing agency Attention President Tom Buontempo. Facebook allows advertising on its videos, including in-stream ads that play during Facebook Live streamed content —also known as mid-roll — with 2,000 or more followers or the user has reached at least 300 viewers in a recent live video. The company also allows video ads through its Audience Network program, which places ads from Facebook partner companies on websites and other apps. But advertisers and agencies have raised concerns to CNBC over where their ads will run, given that Facebook targets ads based on user interest instead of by category. They also said they don't know exactly what will happen in a live stream, which makes advertising a risk. ""As Facebook Live is an evolving platform it remains to be seen how it will fully development and what role it will play more broadly for society, and how brands can take part,"" said Chris Allieri, founder and principal at public relations and branding firm Mulbery & Astor. ""You'll find kids' birthday parties, live-streamed tech conferences or your aunt's Caribbean cruise alongside potentially very disturbing content."" Allieri suggested Facebook should be able to block ads on videos users have reported as potentially criminal or violent, as well as find a way to alert relevant authorities as an incident is happening. Facebook does currently allow advertisers to opt out of any video ad placement, a spokesperson confirmed. Once something is reported by a user as questionable, a global team reviews the item in question, usually within hours. Videos are taken down if the content is in violation of its standards, and the company does notify law enforcement if the content threatens someone's safety.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/17/possible-crime-video-uploaded-to-facebook-shows-why-advertisers-are-still-wary-of-livestreaming.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,488

The new farms hit by the highly contagious disease are in Haiphong and Thanh Hoa provinces, 100 km to the east and 160 km to the south of Hanoi, respectively, according to a report in the Nong Nghiep Vietnam newspaper, run by the Ministry of Agriculture. The virus is spreading at locations around the capital city of Hanoi, which will host the second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later this week. Authorities have culled all the pigs at the farms, including 226 pigs at the farm in Thanh Hoa province. Authorities said last week that African swine fever had been detected at three farms in the Thai Binh and Hung Yen provinces, the first confirmed cases of the disease in the Southeast Asian country. The disease, which is incurable in pigs but harmless to humans, has spread rapidly across neighboring China since August. Pork accounts for three quarters of total meat consumption in Vietnam, a country of 95 million people where most of its 30 million farm-raised pigs are consumed domestically. “Our first priority at the moment is to contain the disease from spreading,” Deputy Minister of Agriculture Phung Duc Tien was quoted as saying in the report. “If it spreads further, it will be very difficult to contain,” Tien said.

Kiwi, the startup that makes and manages the one hundred-strong fleet of robots, issued a statement to say that the fire was quickly extinguished by a passerby before the city’s fire department arrived and doused the machine in foam. No one was harmed as a result of the incident. Kiwi suspended its service until it was able to complete its investigation. It said that it believed the fire was caused by human error, when a faulty battery was manually inserted into the robot, eventually causing thermal runaway — the same issue that resulted in the recall of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 phones. Kiwi says that a new piece of software will “rigorously monitor the state of each battery” to prevent anything like this from happening again. Kiwi said the incident resulted in “some smoke and minor flames.” But video captured of the event shows the robot engulfed in the kind of fiercely burning fireball typically associated with battery fires. The KiwiBots are currently only available in Berkeley, and are designed to handle the last 300 meters of food deliveries. Kiwi’s delivery process costs $3.80, and is formed of three different parts. First a robot carries a food order from a restaurant’s counter to the street, where it is then picked up by a courier on a tricycle. This courier then takes the food delivery to within a few hundred meters of its destination, before a KiwiBot is used to take it directly to a person’s door. The service launched in 2017, and as of May this year had made over 10,000 such deliveries with an average delivery time of 27 minutes, according to the company. so a delivery robot caught fire on berkeley's campus and students set up a candlelight vigil for it pic.twitter.com/alen7vF7Ho The incident comes at a critical time for the nascent robot delivery industry. Several companies including Starship, and more recently Postmates, have either announced or already begun testing their autonomous delivery services. However at least one city, San Francisco, has imposed limits on the use of these machines by requiring them to have permits and restricting their use to less-crowded areas of the city. Images of Kiwi’s flaming robot in a public space are unlikely to abate these concerns.

One chief executive calls it a ""game-changer."" Apple unveiled its new operating system for its iPhone and iPad products, the iOS 11, at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday. The system also introduces ARKit, a new framework for developers to more easily build apps that use augmented reality: the tech that allows devices to display computer-generated images over the real world. ""By blending digital objects and information with the environment around you, augmented reality takes apps beyond the screen, freeing them to interact with the real world in entirely new ways,"" the tech giant said on its preview website. Virtual and augmented reality product company Marxent has been developing AR apps for Apple products for six years. The company's CEO and co-founder, Beck Besecker, called the announcement a ""game changer"" because it will help to embed the tech into everyday life. ""(This) could theoretically add a 4th dimension to how we experience the world,"" he told CNBC in an email comment. ""Once Apple starts integrating AR into the most popular apps, like email, texting, photos, maps and music, it will bring AR into our lives in a deep and meaningful way on a daily basis "" Geoff Blaber, VP research for Americas at CCS Insight, also praised ARKit, saying it will help developers to create engaging experiences in AR. The field of augmented reality will benefit from Apple's scale overnight. Although Apple is theoretically late and behind initiatives such as Google's Tango, we expect ARKit will spur developers to embrace the technology more meaningfully, "" he said in a research note Tuesday. Others already in the AR game include Facebook, Microsoft and Snapchat. The key for Apple to be successful in the space is content, which the ARKit will help to develop, according to Besecker. ""No AR content, no interest. An ARKit developer framework that simplifies content creation and makes it easy and foolproof for developers to include AR features in existing iOS apps is huge,"" he said.

""Many of you have been waiting for this, some even asked me to do it,"" Guccifer 2.0 wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. ""So, this is the moment. I hacked the Clinton Foundation server and downloaded hundreds of thousands of docs and donors' databases.""  But the hacker's latest alleged feat appears to be a complete lie.  Shortly after the hacker's blog post, officials from the Clinton Foundation denied it.  ""We still have no evidence Clinton Foundation systems were breached and have not been notified by law enforcement of an issue,"" an official said in an emailed statement. ""None of the folders or files shown are from the Clinton Foundation.""  And as The Hill noted, many of the individuals who appear in the alleged Clinton Foundation donors' list are actually not donors, according to the foundation's own public disclosure. And some of the people in the list appear to be contributors to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), which was also allegedly hacked by Guccifer 2.0.  Even the Daily Caller, hardly a pro-Clinton news outlet, wrote that ""a review of the newly released documents reveals no information about the Clinton Foundation.""  All things considered, it seems like Guccifer 2 is lying.  The hacker said that the foundation denials don't matter ""for this is just a tiny part of the files I got from their server."" ""They'll see, they'll see,"" he told Motherboard via Twitter direct message. ""Nancy Pelosi also denied that her pc was hacked but it was."" Guccifer 2.0 surfaced in late June, claiming to be the hacker behind the data breach of the Democratic National Committee, which security experts and the company that investigated it suspect was conducted by Russian government spies.  At the time, Guccifer 2.0 claimed to be a lone Romanian hacker trying to expose the ""illuminati,"" and denied being Russian. But he could not actually speak Romanian, and numerous experts believed he was just a rather clumsy attempt by the Russian government to cover up their own hack.  In the following weeks, as researchers poured over the evidence, it became clear that all signs pointed to Russia being behind the DNC hack, and not a lone hacker named Guccifer 2.0 who loves Gucci and women, as he described himself in an exclusive interview with Motherboard. And while there's still no conclusive proof, the hacker's evolution from an almost clueless hacktivist to a sophisticated, professional leaker, seemed to confirm the theory.  This latest release, designed to make it look like the Clinton Foundation was another victim in his seemingly endless series of data breaches, seems to confirm what everyone already suspected.

He had said he wasn't sure if she would be open to sitting down with him. ""I'm all for super-progressive tax systems,"" said Gates, the world's second-richest person and co-chair of the nonprofit Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, during an appearance at the New York Times' DealBook conference in New York on Wednesday. He argued that taxing too much, though, could jeopardize the U.S.' status as the place to build innovative businesses. Gates said he was somewhere in between the extremes of cutting the estate tax and imposing a 6% wealth tax on billionaires, an idea Warren, a Massachusetts senator, floated last week. Gates said the estate tax could be higher. Warren's willingness to talk with Gates suggests that there could be even more attention on an already controversial policy that's emerged in the run-up to the 2020 presidential race. In recent days Warren has exchanged criticisms with investor Leon Cooperman in the context of the federal contributions billionaires ought to make. Gates said he has paid over $10 billion in taxes, more than anyone else, and would be happy to pay $20 billion. ""When you say I should pay $100 billion, OK, then I'm starting to do a little bit of math about what I have left over,"" Gates told Andrew Ross Sorkin, a New York Times columnist and co-anchor of CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""Sorry, I'm just kidding."" Warren alluded to Gates' $100 billion comment in a Wednesday tweet in which she offered to meet with him. Gates was asked how he would proceed if Warren were selected to face President Donald Trump in the election next year. ""I'm not going to make political declarations,"" Gates said. ""But I do think no matter what policy somebody has in mind, a professional approach is even — as much as I disagree with some of the policy things that are out there, I do think a professional approach to the office — whoever I decide would have the more professional approach in the current situation probably will weigh — is the thing that I'll weigh the most."" Gates is hoping the more professional candidate is electable, he added.

About 9% of US adults between the ages of 50 and 64 have used marijuana at least once during the survey year, while 3% of those over 65 have done so, new research finds.  For middle-age adults, the percentage of cannabis users has doubled over nearly a decade, according to the study, published Thursday in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence. Older adults have seen a seven-fold increase in that period. Though marijuana use is increasing among older Americans, ""most of these people are not first-time users,"" said Joseph Palamar, senior study author and an associate professor in the Department of Population Health at New York University Langone Medical Center. ""I don't think we need to worry about millions of older people trying weed for the first time,"" he said. ""At least not yet."" 'High rates of unhealthy substance use' Palamar examined data from 17,608 adults 50 and older who took the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has conducted this survey each year since 1971 in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.  Participants answer questions about their tobacco, alcohol and drug use in addition to providing demographic information and details about their health.   Analyzing survey data from 2015-16 and 2006-07, the researchers compared marijuana users and non-users within and across age groups both past and present.  Prevalence of past-year marijuana use was 9% among middle-age adults and 2.9% among older adults, and past-month use prevalence was 5.7% among middle-age adults and 1.7% among older adults, according to the report. ""We found high rates of unhealthy substance use (tobacco, alcohol, prescription drug misuse) by middle-aged and older adults who use marijuana,"" Dr. Benjamin Han, lead author of the study and an assistant professor at the New York University School of Medicine, wrote in an email.   For example, the study shows that nearly 5% of middle-age marijuana users had alcohol use problems, 9% depended on nicotine, and 3.5% misused opioids; among older adults, 1.5% had alcohol use problems, 3.5% depended on nicotine, and 1.2% misused opioids.  In addition to opioids, past-year marijuana users were more likely to misuse sedatives and tranquilizers than their peers, according to the report.  Han said that ""polysubstance use"" or the ""use of multiple substances, especially unhealthy use, is particularly risky for older adults with chronic diseases."" Marijuana may intensify symptoms of existing conditions while interacting with prescribed medications.  Palamar noted that ""depending on the drugs combined, the effects can be much stronger.""  ""Combining marijuana with alcohol can really knock someone on their ass if they weren't expecting such strong effects,"" he said. Health and legal risks Baby boomers have more experience with marijuana than previous generations, the study authors said. More than half (almost 55%) of middle-age adults have used marijuana at some point in their lives, while over a fifth (about 22%) of older adults have done so, Han and Palamar found. With a growing number of states legalizing medical and recreational marijuana, health care professionals find themselves in a bind, Han said. ""I get asked more and more by older patients if they should try marijuana, mostly for sleep or pain,"" said Han, who practices geriatric medicine. ""Marijuana may be therapeutically useful for a variety of symptoms and medical conditions, but the research in this area is extremely limited.""  More research is needed to define risks and benefits of using marijuana in these age groups while providing more information about safety, dosing, method of use (inhalation or ingestion) and symptoms, Han said.  For now, though, it is ""hard for us as providers to recommend it aside for very specific clinical indications (especially compared to well-studied other options),"" Han wrote. ""Especially if we do not fully understand its risks for older adults or those with multiple chronic medical conditions.""  Another concern? Baby boomers face ""potential legal risks of use if they live in a state where marijuana is illegal,"" Palamar said. Opposite ends of the spectrum Christopher P. Salas-Wright, an assistant professor at the Boston University School of Social Work, said the new study provides ""high-quality information"" that is essential in a time when public opinion and policies related to marijuana are changing rapidly. That said, a number of ""credible studies"" already provide ""compelling evidence that marijuana use has increased meaningfully among adults in general, and among middle-aged and older adults in particular, over the last 10 to 15 years,"" said Salas-Wright, who was not involved in the new study but has published research on the topic.   It's not only use but problem use of marijuana that has increased among adults in these age groups, he said.  ""There is strong evidence that regular marijuana use is related to outcomes such as motor vehicle accidents, symptoms of chronic bronchitis and addiction to marijuana and other substances,"" he said.  Although many baby boomers ""likely use marijuana without experiencing any serious problems"" -- the same as alcohol -- ""we should not lose sight of the fact that marijuana is a psychoactive drug"" and so poses the ""risk of adverse consequences,"" Salas-Wright said. In a national study published in 2015, Salas-Wright showed ""that rates of marijuana use declined slightly among youth ages 12 to 14 and have remained flat among those ages 15 to 17 since 2002.""  Baby boomers turning to cannabis, then, is happening alongside a decline in drug use and other risky behaviors among teens, Salas-Wright noted. Though the new study makes an ""incremental contribution"" to science, Namkee Choi, a professor in the School of Social Work at the University of Texas at Austin, said that a different kind of marijuana study is needed today. Choi, who did not participate in the new research, said a 2017 report from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine ""summarizes very well how little scientific evidence we have so far about marijuana's effects on health and mental health in adulthood."" ""We know more about marijuana's negative effects during formative years,"" said Choi, who has published extensive research on cannabis' effects. ""More research is needed to evaluate marijuana's beneficial and negative effects on health and mental health for all age groups and effective treatment modalities for marijuana use disorder."" Han said the number of baby boomers using weed will probably continue to grow due to changing laws. Because risky drug use could become a problem for some, he suggests that health care providers screen middle-age and older patients for substance use.

2018-11-29 00:00:00,2018,11.0,29,"Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter limit data access for AI-powered babysitter background checks","Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have limited the amount of data that’s accessible to Predictim, a California-based startup that uses machine learning to vet potential babysitters. The social networks took action against the company after a report by The Washington Post last week detailed its methods, attracting widespread criticism. Predictim claims to use “advanced artificial intelligence” to judge a babysitter’s suitability. This includes combing through an individual’s Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter histories before offering an automated assessment of their character. The company claims it can predict whether the individual is a drug user, if they might bully or harass others, and even if they have a “bad attitude.” Experts have criticized Predictim’s service as unscientific, noting that machine learning is notoriously unreliable when it comes to parsing complex data like human speech. AI might be good at recognizing objects in photos or digitizing handwriting, but it can’t reliably interpret nuances in tone and speech like sarcasm or jokes. Experts in data policy also noted that Predictim’s software doesn’t explain how it comes to its decisions, which means that a potential babysitter could lose a job without ever knowing why or offering an explanation. Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have all taken action against Predictim over the last few weeks, report The Washington Post and BBC News. Facebook says it dramatically limited the company’s access to user data on Facebook and Instagram after it violated a ban against developers using this information to vet job candidates. Twitter revoked Predictim’s access to its API (which is used to access data on a scale, rather than reading individual profiles) earlier this week. A spokesperson told the Post, “We strictly prohibit the use of Twitter data and APIs for surveillance purposes, including performing background checks.” Predictim’s chief executive and co-founder, Sal Parsa, said the company had done nothing wrong. “Everyone looks people up on social media, they look people up on Google,” Parsa told BBC News. “We’re just automating this process.” Parsa also suggested that the social networks, which scan users’ data in order to target ads to them, have their own motivations for blocking his software. “Twitter and Facebook are already mining our data,” Parsa told the Post. “It’s right there, user-generated data. Now there’s another start-up that’s trying to take advantage of that data to help parents pick a better babysitter, and make a little money in the process.” Regardless of these actions, wider questions regarding the legality of automated background checks are still up in the air. Some experts have suggested that Predictim’s software might violate state-level bans on employers demanding access to the social media accounts of job applicants. Other social networks want to block this sort of data scraping altogether. LinkedIn is currently in the middle of a legal battle against third-party site HiQ, which scraped its data to predict when employees might leave their jobs. Meanwhile, companies continue to create more AI-powered screening services, not just looking at social media activity but other metrics including individuals’ interview performance. Experts worry that handing over crucial decisions to algorithms that cannot explain their thinking or understand human behavior is unwise, while firms selling these services say a machine-level approach is more detailed and impartial.",https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/29/18117660/ai-background-checks-babysitter-predictim-data-limited-facebook-twitter-instagram,Tech,The Verge,technology,532
2017-05-08 17:57:00,2017,5.0,8,"The Cruelest, Most Dishonest Part of the Republican Healthcare Plan","One of the most important things about the American Health Care Act (AHCA), the bill passed in the House on Thursday that would strip away many of the benefits and regulations of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is what it would do to Medicaid. If the AHCA became law, it would strip $880 billion over ten years from the program that provides health services to the poor, especially needy populations like children, new mothers, and the chronically ill. This is a big, big deal—one of the centerpieces of the bill—and it's telling that Republicans are arguing that it won't be that important. On Sunday, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price went on CNN's Face the Nation and said that taking $880 billion from Medicaid won't hurt patients, that it will actually help them by giving states more freedom to administer their individual Medicaid programs. On ABC's This Week, House Speaker Paul Ryan characterized the lost $880 billion as ""giving the states the ability to customize Medicaid to meet the particular needs of their vulnerable populations"" and claimed that care would be improved because the AHCA would also end ""the micromanagement of Medicaid by the federal government."" Explaining what the hell they're talking about will take a minute. Because the $880 billion is not a straightforward cut. Currently, how Medicaid works is the federal government matches state funding to provide care to low-income people and others who need a lot of medical treatment; in exchange, the federal government hands down some requirements for how this money should be spent. Republicans argue that these requirements are burdensome and instead want a ""block grant"" system where the federal government gives states a set amount of money to spend as they wish, with less oversight. Under the AHCA, that amount would be capped based on how many people each state has enrolled in Medicaid. Though that part of the bill wouldn't kick in until 2020, the new limit would force states to make hard decisions. ""With less federal reimbursement for Medicaid, states would need to decide whether to commit more of their own resources to finance the program at current-law levels or whether to reduce spending by cutting payments to health care providers and health plans, eliminating optional services, restricting eligibility for enrollment, or (to the extent feasible) arriving at more efficient methods for delivering services,"" reads a Congressional Budget Office report on an old version of the AHCA. (The current version of the bill hasn't been analyzed by the CBO, but the parts about Medicaid haven't changed.) Additionally, the AHCA would scrap the parts of the ACA that give more federal money to the states to provide care to new Medicaid enrollees, making Medicaid expansion less attractive. Again, a lot would depend on what states would decide to do, and the law wouldn't take full effect until a few years from now. But according to the CBO, 9 million fewer people would have Medicaid by 2020 as a result of the AHCA, and that number would rise to 14 million by 2026. Basically, the federal government would spend less on insuring poor people because fewer poor people would be able to get insurance. The new restrictions on Medicaid spending would hurt even states like Texas that didn't expand the program as the ACA allowed. Children would be disproportionately affected since so many of them rely on Medicaid; so would people with chronic conditions who pay for care with a combination of Medicaid and Medicare, which provides insurance for seniors and people with disabilities. Less Medicaid money would also hurt the hospital industry—meanwhile, more low-income people who lacked insurance would be coming to emergency rooms for treatment. Those people might not be denied access to medicine, but they might be forced into bankruptcy by healthcare costs. Oh, and the AHCA would also stop Medicaid funds from going to Planned Parenthood for at least a year, which would lead to a lot of women going without the organization's services. What do Republicans want to do with the savings caused by all of this disruption? Cut taxes for the rich. The GOP Establishment has wanted to ""reform""—a.k.a. cut—Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security for years, supposedly on the grounds that these entitlement programs are going to become unaffordable over time. That's why Donald Trump's campaign not to cut those programs was news, though since he endorses the AHCA it's obvious that that promise was something we weren't supposed to take him literally or seriously on. Paul Ryan once joked he was dreaming about converting Medicaid into block grants way back when he was going to conservative keggers in his 20s. Not all Republicans are onboard with this provision in the AHCA, however. ""By repealing Obamacare's Medicaid expansion and replacing it with a flat tax credit that doesn't provide enough assistance to the working poor, millions with incomes above the poverty line are going to lose their insurance under Ryancare,"" wrote Avik Roy, a former healthcare policy adviser to Mitt Romney who supports other parts of the AHCA. Many other experts are wary about these changes to Medicaid, as are Republican senators in states that have expanded Medicaid. It's a part of the bill that very likely won't get past the Senate, which is good news for the tens of millions of poor or high-need people who rely on the program. But the inclusion of such harsh spending cuts as a key part of a reform plan says a lot about the philosophy that many Republicans embrace. They are eager to expand military spending and put more money into border security (though few want a wall). They're perfectly fine with the surveillance state, unless of course it's politically convenient for them to be against it. Tax cuts that balloon the deficit? They'll pay for themselves, whatever. But when the federal government is helping more poor people access healthcare, all of a sudden Republicans are the voice of fiscal restraint.

2020-03-30 00:00:00,2020,3.0,30,What you need to know about coronavirus right now,"(Reuters) - Here’s what you need to know about the coronavirus right now: Shelter from the financial storm The numbers have been staggering: $15 trillion wiped off stock markets, airlines have had half their value vaporized and cratering economies risk a new wave of government debt crises. So where are the places to park your money? Sit-on-your-sofa-suited stocks like Netflix and Amazon have risen and some specialized medical equipment companies have surged. Ultra-safe U.S. government bonds too appear a safe harbor, returning 13% as the Fed cut U.S. interest rates to effectively zero. Though the cavalry has arrived in the G20 promise of a $5 trillion revival effort, it’s unlikely that April will bring much relief. “Our expectation is for a very volatile second quarter,” Stephane Monier, chief investment officer of Lombard Odier, said. “It is important to keep in liquid, high-quality assets.” ‘Blind luck’: South Korea practiced an emergency response to fictional pneumonia outbreak in December According to an undisclosed government document seen by Reuters, two dozen leading South Korean infectious diseases specialists tackled a worrying scenario in a tabletop exercise on emergency responses on Dec. 17: a South Korean family contracts pneumonia after a trip to China, where cases of an unidentified disease had arisen. This led the team of experts at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) to develop an algorithm to find the pathogen and its origin, as well as to test techniques. Those measures were mobilized in real life when a first suspected coronavirus patient appeared in South Korea on Jan. 20, the document said. “It was blind luck - we were speechless to see the scenario become reality,” said Lee Sang-won, one of the KCDC experts who led the drill. “But the exercise helped us save much time developing testing methodology and identifying cases.” (Coronavirus knowns and unknowns: click reut.rs/2UHIgvz to have some of your basic questions answered.) The spread There are over 720,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide, with more than 57,000 cases added in the last 24 hours across 202 countries and territories. The United States reported over 18,000 new cases in the past day, roughly a third of all new cases. North America now accounts for 20% of all cases, and Europe 53%, though fatality rates in the latter are much higher than in the United States. There were 3,208 deaths reported in the last day, bringing the total number of fatalities to 34,000. The global average fatality rate of the disease remains high at around 4.7%, though that figure is expected to drop as testing widens. Countries with unusually high fatality rates include Italy, where around 11% of reported cases have been fatal, and Spain, where 8% of cases have been fatal. China continues to report low numbers of new cases, with just 31 new infections on Sunday and only one locally contracted case. The country closed its borders to foreign passport holders on Saturday. Globally, over 145,000 cases have been reportedly cured, around 20%. The recovery rate has reached 92.5% in China where the virus peaked over a month ago.

Two meters (6 feet, 6 inches) of separation is seen as critical to preventing transmission of the coronavirus, but with few people carrying tape measures, rules of thumb have become important.

In nature-loving Oregon, standing back about “one mature white sturgeon” should do the trick, the U.S. state’s fish and wildlife department wrote on Twitter, while the City of Calgary, Alberta, suggested a “big llama.” Even a large llama’s length may not work, though. A study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded coughs and sneezes can generate clouds of viral droplets of seven to eight meters. That’s roughly four hockey sticks.

The recently discovered millipede boasts 414 legs, 200 poison glands, and four penises. The Illacme tobini millipede was discovered in a marble cave somewhere in California's Sequoia National Park back in 2006, but the researchers only found one. The diplopodologists—scientists who study millipedes—that found the creature were hoping to find more specimen before publishing, and kept going back to the caves and surrounding habitats in search of more tobini millipedes, according to a study published in the journal ZooKeys Tuesday. The paper details how researchers conducted their search, which is pretty much how you might expect to go millipede-hunting: ""The undersides of large stones were examined. The bases of decaying logs and leaf litter were also searched."" Unfortunately, no other specimen were discovered, so the researchers decided it was time to document their findings. Tobini doesn't take the title for most legs on a millipede: that belongs to its relative, Illacme plenipes, which has 750. But it's still a fascinating creature, with a mouth that even the researchers describe as ""peculiar,"" that probably adapted to eat fungus in the cave walls. It also has hairs that produce silk and pores all along its body that secrete an unidentified liquid, believed to be poisonous. ""I never would have expected that a second species of the leggiest animal on the planet would be discovered in a cave 150 miles away,"" Paul Marek, a Virginia Tech entomologist and co-author of the paper, said in a press release.

These measures come as the firm faces increasing pressure from the government and public to improve the safety of its platform after a 20-year-old passenger was murdered by her Didi driver last month in the second such incident since May. Earlier this month, the firm had said it would temporarily suspend some late-night services over Sept. 8-15 as it prepared to take the new safety steps. Didi will resume late-night services but drivers of express and premier cars who want to pick up passengers between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. local time will need to have a service record of more than six months and over 1,000 safe trips, the firm said in a statement on its official WeChat account. The company, which began trial audio recording of trips from Sept. 8, said it had since recorded audio for almost 80 percent of all rides, adding that the recordings will be automatically deleted after a week in the absence of any dispute. Also, since Sept. 4, almost 7 million new passengers have set up emergency contacts who will be immediately notified if the rider clicks the app’s one-tap police assistance function, Didi said in the statement. It, however, said it was still unable to automatically upload information from that one-tap button to Chinese police and was actively seeking solutions. Didi has tripled the number of staff in its critical response safety team between Sept. 4-14, as part of a pledge to form an in-house professional customer service team of 8,000 people by the end of this year. Didi and other ride-hailing firms are currently under heavy scrutiny from the Chinese government, which has pledged to scrub the industry of vehicles and drivers that fail to meet safety standards by the end of 2018.

Manitoba projected a C$220 million ($151.7 million) deficit for the 2020-21 fiscal year on Thursday, down from C$325 million in the current year ending March 31. The spread of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, could drive up health costs, however, and cut government revenues for a combined hit of as much as C$682 million to its bottom line. Manitoba’s economy depends on farming, manufacturing and mining. The Progressive Conservative government, led by Premier Brian Pallister, said it would top up its so-called rainy-day fund to C$800 million this month from C$571 million, giving it a buffer to deal with COVID-19. Unveiling of the C$15.1 billion ($10.4 billion) budget was postponed from last week by procedural delays in the Manitoba legislature by the opposition New Democrats. The province has run deficits since 2009-10, after a major flood and economic downturn blew a hole in its finances. The government is on track to balanc the budget within its current term, said Finance Minister Scott Fielding. The government will lower its sales tax by 1 point to 6% as of July 1.

2019-10-14 00:00:00,2019,10.0,14,China's Huawei says open to 'no backdoor' agreement with India,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - China’s Huawei Technologies is ready to enter into a “no backdoor” agreement with India to allay security concerns, the telecom group’s local head said on Monday, as the giant South Asian country prepares to launch next generation 5G networks. India, the world’s second-biggest wireless market by users, will hold an airwaves auction for 5G services before March, according to the country’s Telecoms Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad. It has yet to begin 5G trials and has not taken a decision on allowing or banning Huawei from the test runs amid a U.S.-led push to shut out the Chinese tech and telecoms group, saying its gear contained “back doors” that would enable China to spy on other countries. Beijing denies such a plan. Huawei, which has a 28% global share of the telecoms equipment market, is closely engaging with India to clarify its stand on 5G solutions, network security and Chinese intelligence laws, Jay Chen, the CEO of its India unit, told Reuters in an interview on Monday on the sidelines of India Mobile Congress. “From the very beginning, I have confidence that Indian industry, the India market will welcome Huawei because I have contributed a lot with my unique value,” Chen said. “I am ready to sign (a no-backdoor agreement).” Shenzhen-headquartered Huawei has been blacklisted by countries including the United States, Australia and New Zealand while others are still evaluating their position. Indian telecom carriers Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have used Huawei, as well as its European rivals Nokia and Ericsson, to build their 2G, 3G and 4G networks and have previously underscored the importance of having all three players in India to maintain competition, price and service quality. “If (the Indian) government wants, we are open to having the source codes in an escrow account,” Chen said, adding that the company was also willing to manufacture more of its telecoms gear locally. China has asked India not to block Huawei from doing business in the country, warning there could be consequences for Indian firms operating in China, Reuters reported previously. A potential row over Huawei’s participation in India’s 5G push could revive tensions between Beijing and New Delhi at a time the two countries have been making high-level efforts to ensure their long standing territorial disputes do not escalate. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met last week in an Indian beach town in a bid to resolve border disputes, trade rows and ease concerns about China’s close military ties with India’s arch rival, Pakistan. “India cannot afford to wait longer for 5G,” Chen said, highlighting the importance of Huawei’s participation in the country’s 5G launch. “I always suggest move forward for 5G trial, move forward with 5G auction.” Reporting by Sankalp Phartiyal; Editing by Nick Macfie",https://www.reuters.com/article/huawei-india/chinas-huawei-says-open-to-no-backdoor-agreement-with-india-idUSL3N26Z31S,Technology News,Reuters,technology,466
2016-11-15 00:00:00,2016,11.0,15,"Nokia says telecoms gear market tough, but outpacing Ericsson","BARCELONA/HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia (NOKIA.HE) said on Tuesday it was outperforming arch-rival Ericsson (ERICb.ST) in a weak telecoms equipment market, but its shares fell as its dividend plans and profitability forecasts missed analysts’ expectations. Telecoms network suppliers are struggling after demand for 4G mobile broadband equipment peaked last year, with upgrades to next-generation 5G equipment still years away. Nokia, which bought rival Alcatel-Lucent this year in a bid to cope, forecast at an investor meeting in Barcelona that its network equipment sales were likely to fall around 2 percent next year, in line with the broader market, and return to modest growth in 2018. It also predicted demand for network equipment among telecoms operators would grow on a compound annual basis by just 1.2 percent from 2016-2021. The Finnish company said the market was the toughest it had been for years but that it was faring better than bigger rival Ericsson, which in recent months has issued a dramatic profit warning and replaced its chief executive. “Nokia is not Ericsson. They are in crisis. We outperformed them in every area,” Chief Executive Rajeev Suri said. With growth expected to be subdued through the end of the decade, Nokia is looking to keep investors on board with tight cost control, investments in new technology and returns to shareholders. Some analysts, however, were disappointed by Nokia’s dividend and profitability targets, and its shares fell as much as 7.7 percent to a three-year low of 3.658 euros. “People were hoping for better,” Societe Generale analyst Alexander Peterc said, noting Nokia had pared back share buybacks and planned to increase its dividend only modestly. “All these measures point to a company being highly focused on cash-conservation,” he said. Peterc recently joined SocGen and has no formal rating on Nokia shares. Network equipment firms are also trying to entice investors with visions of future growth from 5G networks, which could start as early as 2018 but are only expected to go mainstream after 2020. Ericsson, Nokia and China’s Huawei [HWT.UL] account for 90 percent of mobile network gear sales, but face growing competition from other network and software players. Ericsson released a new market forecast on Tuesday, predicting global mobile phone subscriptions would nearly double to 6.8 billion six years out, from 3.9 billion this year. It said it now expected 5G mobile subscribers to reach 550 million by 2022, three-and-a-half times higher than its previous estimate of 150 million forecast for 2021. Nokia said cost cuts would help to boost its network unit’s operating margin to 8-10 percent in 2017 from an estimated 7-9 percent in 2016, and to 10-15 percent in the long-term. It also said it planned a dividend of 0.17 euros per share for 2016. Analysts polled by Reuters last month had expected a 2017 margin of 10.5 percent and a dividend of 0.20 euros. Buying Franco-American Alcatel-Lucent expanded Nokia’s business in fixed-line telecoms equipment and optical networks, which some analysts say has helped it to outperform Ericsson. But Nokia on Tuesday lifted its estimate for restructuring charges from Alcatel’s integration by 500 million euros to about 1.7 billion euros. It is axing thousands of jobs as it seeks to cut 1.2 billion euros of annual costs by 2018. Setting out its forecasts, Nokia said it expected the network equipment market to decline in Europe, China and Latin America next year, while remaining flat in North America, Middle East, Africa and Asia, outside of China. “The mobile network market is (in) the toughest shape it has been in my lifetime,” Chief Financial Officer Timo Ihamuotila told investors. Nokia forecast the network gear market would return to modest growth in 2018 fueled by a rebound in several regions, although demand would remain flat in Europe and fall over the next five years in Greater China. It said upside to its forecasts could come from new customers beyond telecoms operators, including big Internet players, automakers and industrial Internet companies. In the near term, it also sees fresh growth from equipping police and other emergency services with new 4G voice and video equipment. Once known for its mobile phones, Nokia sold the handset business to Microsoft (MSFT.O) in 2014, leaving it with the networks business and a portfolio of technology patents.

2018-02-07 05:00:26,2018,2.0,7,Here Are the World’s Virtual Currency Billionaires (or at Least They Were),"SAN FRANCISCO — The creators of the famous Forbes rich list have made their first attempt to identify the wealthiest people in the virtual currency industry. Yet the list that was published on Wednesday, right after major drops in virtual currency prices, inadvertently also served as a reminder of the fleeting nature of that wealth. While the list in Forbes magazine, which was assembled in recent weeks, identifies about 10 virtual currency billionaires, most of them were not billionaires by the time the feature went online on Wednesday morning. On Monday alone, the prices of many virtual currencies plummeted over 20 percent, before stabilizing on Tuesday. At the top of the list is Chris Larsen, a founder of the Ripple virtual currency. Mr. Larsen was briefly estimated to be wealthier than Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg last month when Ripple’s price peaked, taking his net wealth to nearly $60 billion. Since then, the price of Ripple’s digital token, XRP, has fallen more than 80 percent. Forbes put Mr. Larsen’s wealth at around $8 billion, but the same holdings were worth less than $6 billion by Wednesday. Mr. Larsen is followed on the Forbes list by Joseph Lubin, an early investor in the Ethereum virtual currency network; Changpeng Zhao, founder of the virtual currency exchange Binance; the brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, longtime Bitcoin investors who are famous from their legal battles with Mr. Zuckerberg over Facebook; and Matthew Mellon, the banking heir who is now a major holder of XRP. The list is a reminder of how the biggest gains in virtual currencies have been reaped by a small number of early adopters — despite the early promises that virtual currencies could democratize the financial system and spread wealth more evenly. Nearly all of the people on the list either helped found virtual currencies or have been involved with them for years. Recent efforts to quantify the inequality among Bitcoin holders have found that it is significantly higher than in even the most stratified countries, which may sting many people who recently rushed into virtual currencies and are now sitting on losses. For early virtual currency adopters like the people on the Forbes list, the recent price declines are not catastrophic. The price of Bitcoin is still up 600 percent from a year ago, and up 70,000 percent from when the Winklevoss twins began buying in 2012. Identifying the richest people in the secretive and paranoid virtual currency realm is far from easy; some of it is guesswork. Mr. Lubin, whom Forbes pegged as the second-wealthiest person in the virtual currency universe, illustrates the difficulties. He told the magazine that he had begun selling his Ethereum tokens, known as Ether, last year to fund his business, ConsenSys. Because Forbes could not verify his holdings, the magazine put his wealth at between $1 billion and $5 billion before the most recent price declines. The normal Forbes billionaires list is easier to compile because the richest people in the world generally have most of their wealth tied up in stock holdings, which usually have to be disclosed for big public companies. With virtual currencies, it is not necessary to disclose your identity, and the system was created by people who were interested in protecting financial privacy. Many large holders of virtual currencies are loath to acknowledge their holdings for privacy and security reasons, and many people who are rumored to have giant Bitcoin stockpiles are not on the Forbes list. Perhaps the most notable omission is Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, whose identity has been guessed at many times but never confirmed. Researchers have guessed that Satoshi, as the creator is known, most likely amassed about one million Bitcoins during the network’s first year, when few other people were mining new tokens. Those Bitcoins would now be worth around $7 billion. Others have publicly claimed to have large holdings without verifying those holdings. Brock Pierce, a former child actor and the leader of a virtual currency community in Puerto Rico, has said he would donate $1 billion of his virtual currency fortune to charity, but Forbes said, “He refuses to provide documentation that proves he has anywhere near that much money.” The magazine estimated Mr. Pierce’s wealth at between $700 million and $1 billion. The list suggests that inventing virtual currencies can end up being less lucrative than investing in them. The magazine estimated that the inventor of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, is less wealthy than two early investors, Mr. Lubin and Anthony Di Iorio, who had previously managed his family’s patio-door business in Canada. And while three big holders of Ripple’s token, XRP, are on the list, the inventor of the digital token, Jed McCaleb, is not.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/technology/forbes-virtual-currency-billionaires.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,785
2020-02-11 00:00:00,2020,2.0,11,Surprise surgery bills happen even when patients plan ahead,"(Reuters Health) - One in five patients who get elective surgery at U.S. hospitals that accept their insurance may still get surprise medical bills, especially if they receive anesthesia, a new study suggests. The study looked at what happened to almost 350,000 patients who had non-emergency surgery between 2012 and 2017 at hospitals and clinics that belonged to their health plan network, using surgeons who accepted their insurance. Even among those who did their best to go where their insurance was accepted, 21% still got surprised by out-of-network bills. And tabs were not small, averaging more than $2,000. “We had no idea how often this actually happened or how damaging it could be,” said Dr. Karan Chhabra, of the University of Michigan Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation in Ann Arbor and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, who led the study. At a time when many Americans with private health insurance are being asked to pay more for their care - in the form of higher premiums, co-payments and deductibles - surprise medical bills are commonplace for emergency care and other situations when people are unable to confirm their benefits in advance. But the current study offers fresh evidence that surprise bills can arrive even after people plan ahead and schedule procedures where their benefits should be accepted, researchers note in JAMA. “They might expect not to have any problems paying for care if they make sure their surgeon and the hospital are in-network,” Chhabra said by email. “Our study shows that is not the case.” Patients got several common types of surgery, including knee operations, removal of a lump from the breast and procedures to improve blood flow to the heart. In more than one-third of cases when patients got surprise bills, a surgical assistant or anesthesiologist was the source. In these cases, the primary surgeon accepted the patient’s insurance but other clinicians did not. Surprise out-of-network bills averaged $3,633 when surgical assistants didn’t accept patients’ insurance and $1,219 when anesthesiologists were the ones out-of-network, the study found. People with insurance plans purchased through health exchanges got surprise bills 27% of the time, compared with 20% of the time with other types of private health coverage. Surgical complications made surprise bills more likely, resulting in unexpected bills 28% of the time, compared with 20% when operations went off without problems. One limitation of the study is that it only included data from patients with benefits from one insurance company, the researchers note. The data also didn’t indicate whether patients understood they had received out-of-network care or what portion of any resulting bills they may have paid. It’s not clear from the study exactly why patients received surprise bills or what they might do to avoid them, said Michelle Mello, a health policy researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine who wasn’t involved in the new research. One thing patients can do, however, is think carefully about whether it makes sense for them to purchase what’s known as a “narrow network” plan, which might have lower premiums but a very limited number of in-network providers and steep fees for getting care outside the network, Mello said by email. “While their premiums are affordable, there are countervailing costs: you may have to wait a lot longer to see a specialist, for example; and there’s a higher risk that the people who take care of you in the hospital won’t all be in network,” Mello said. People should also ask their surgeons, hospitals and insurance companies about out-of-network billing, Mello advised. Hospitals should be able to explain whether an elective surgery might involve out-of-network clinicians. And people shouldn’t just pay the surprise bills without protest. “Make a stink,” Mello advised. “It’s often possible to negotiate these down.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2OMkn3Z , bit.ly/37ge536 and bit.ly/2UPqgRX JAMA, online February 11, 2020.

2016-06-20 00:00:00,2016,6.0,20,Cambodia to deport Taiwan telecoms fraud suspects to China,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia will deport 21 Taiwan nationals to China, a senior Cambodian official said on Monday, ignoring attempts by Taiwanese officials to have them returned instead to Taiwan. Cambodia does not have official relations with self-ruled Taiwan and considers the island part of “one China”, in line with Beijing which considers the island a breakaway province. Cambodia detained the 21 Taiwanese along with 14 Chinese nationals in coordination with Chinese authorities who are attempting to halt the proliferation of internet and phone extortion scams that have cost billions of dollars and driven some victims to suicide. Cambodia has deported more than 200 people suspected of involvement in the rings to China since November. “We will deport them to China under the one-China policy,” Uk Heisela, investigation chief at Cambodia’s immigration department, told Reuters. “They have all confessed to committing the crime.” Taipei has accused Beijing of kidnapping when other countries such as Kenya and Malaysia have deported Taiwanese people to China. Taiwan’s attempts to have the suspects deported to Taiwan had failed, Taipei’s foreign ministry said in a statement. Pressure from Beijing would likely lead to Cambodia deporting them all to China, the ministry said. Taiwan officials based in Vietnam traveled to Cambodia but were not allowed to visit the Taiwanese suspects, the ministry added. Heisela and Kem Sarin, spokesman for Cambodia’s immigration department, said they were unaware of a visit by Taiwanese officials. China is Cambodia’s largest foreign investor, and Cambodia is one of Beijing’s staunchest regional allies. Cambodia had yet to set a date for the deportation, Heisela said. Cambodian authorities arrested 13 of the Taiwanese along with 14 Chinese nationals on June 13. Another 8 Taiwanese suspects were detained on Saturday, said Heisela. Cambodian police said the suspects contacted people in China asking for money to free relatives held captive. The suspects had admitted to posing as police and court officials to extort money, Heisela said. Human Rights Watch said Cambodia’s close relationship with China had led it to ride roughshod over human rights. “This group should be allowed to appeal their deportation in a full and fair hearing in a court of law rather than be hustled on to a plane and sent to an uncertain fate back in China,” said Phil Robertson, the group’s deputy director in Asia. Since 2011, nearly 8,000 people have been arrested in countries including Indonesia, Cambodia and the Philippines on suspicion of involvement in similar fraud schemes. Additional reporting by J.R.

2020-01-08 17:55:37,2020,1.0,8,New York State Investigates Christian Health Cost-Sharing Affiliate,"Subpoenas have been issued to a company that solicits memberships for a health insurance alternative that offers no guarantees for covering medical bills. New York State officials are investigating a business representing a major Christian group offering an alternative to health insurance, joining several states scrutinizing these cost-sharing programs that provide limited coverage. On Wednesday, New York state insurance regulators issued a subpoena to Aliera, which markets the Christian ministry run by Trinity Healthshare, according to people who have seen the subpoena. More than one million Americans have joined such groups, attracted by prices that are far lower than the cost of traditional insurance policies that must meet strict requirements established by the Affordable Care Act, like guaranteed coverage for pre-existing conditions. These Christian nonprofit groups offer low rates because they are not classified as insurance and are under no legal obligation to pay medical claims. But state regulators are questioning some of the ministries’ aggressive marketing tactics, saying some consumers were misled or did not grasp the lack of comprehensive coverage in the case of a catastrophic illness. Some members have paid hundreds of dollars a month, and then have been left with hundreds of thousands in unpaid medical bills in several states where the ministries, which are not subject to regulation as insurers, failed to follow through on pooling members’ expenses. Numerous states are taking action against Aliera Healthcare, the for-profit company based in Georgia that was been the subject of an investigation by The Houston Chronicle. The Texas attorney general sued Aliera last summer to stop it from offering “unregulated insurance products to the public,” while Connecticut, Washington and New Hampshire are trying to stop Trinity and Aliera from doing business in those states. Regulators say they are concerned that the ministry is, in fact, operating as an insurer. In New York, which has not previously investigated any ministries, there have been 15 to 20 complaints, including accusations that Aliera misrepresented the coverage being offered. It’s not clear how many customers Aliera has in New York. “It’s deeply disappointing to see state regulators working to deny their residents access to more affordable alternatives offered by health care sharing ministries,” said Aliera in an emailed statement. “We’re proud of the work we do to help ministries provide a more flexible method for securing affordable high-quality health care, and we will continue to vigorously defend against the false claims about our company, just as we expect the health care sharing ministries we serve to vigorously defend their members’ right to exercise their religious convictions in making health care choices,” it said. Trinity, which was not subject to the subpoena, has said its website makes clear that the ministry does not offer health insurance.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/health/christian-health-insurance-subpoena.html,health,The New York Times,health,454
2019-04-08 11:45:29,2019,4.0,8,"To Improve Memory, Tune It Like an Orchestra","MIND A noninvasive technique shows promise in improving the working memory of older adults. But, the scientists note, “Do not try this at home!” Anyone above a certain age who has drawn a blank on the name of a favorite uncle, a friend’s phone number or the location of a house key understands how fragile memory is. Its speed and accuracy begin to slip in one’s 20s and keep slipping. This is particularly true for working memory, the mental sketch pad that holds numbers, names and other facts temporarily in mind, allowing decisions to be made throughout the day. On Monday, scientists reported that brief sessions of specialized brain stimulation could reverse this steady decline in working memory, at least temporarily. The stimulation targeted key regions in the brain and synchronized neural circuits in those areas, effectively tuning them to one another, as an orchestra conductor might tune the wind section to the strings. The findings, reported in the journal Nature Neuroscience, provide the strongest support yet for a method called transcranial alternating current stimulation, or tACS, as a potential therapy for memory deficits, whether from age-related decline, brain injury or, perhaps, creeping dementia. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] In recent years, neuroscientists have shown that memory calls on a widely distributed network in the brain, and it coordinates those interactions through slow-frequency, thrumming rhythms called theta waves, akin to the pulsing songs shared among humpback whales. The tACS technology is thought to enable clearer communication by tuning distant circuits to one another. The tACS approach is appealing for several reasons, perhaps most of all because it is noninvasive; unlike other forms of memory support, it involves no implant, which requires brain surgery. The stimulation passes through the skull with little sensation. Still, a widely available therapy is likely years away, as the risks and benefits are not fully understood, experts said. “This study suggests that age-related impairment in one particular form of short-term memory largely reflects a failure of synchronization,” said Michael Kahana, a brain scientist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the research. If the technique can boost other forms of memory, “it could be a game changer for the treatment of age-related memory decline and possibly even dementia,” Dr. Kahana said. In the new study, Robert M.G. Reinhart and John A. Nguyen, neuroscientists at Boston University, invited two groups of subjects, young adults and people in their 60s and 70s, to the lab for baseline measures of their neural firing rhythms. The scientists tailored the tACS program to optimize rhythmic “coupling” between frontal and temporal cortex areas in each individual’s brain. These brain regions specifically support working memory. After 25 minutes of gentle stimulation, delivered by electrodes built into a skullcap, the older subjects performed just as well on memory tests as young adults. The participants tested their own working memories repeatedly, completing 10 sessions on a computer-based program that mimicked the old Highlights magazine game: stare at an image, then decide if subsequent images are identical or have subtle differences. They performed under several conditions, including without stimulation; with “sham” stimulation, as a placebo control, and with the targeted tACS. The results were striking. Young people reliably outperformed their elders in the no-stimulation and sham conditions. But with the aid of the tACS, the older participants did just as well as their younger counterparts. And their working memory remained sharp for as long as the researchers continued testing it, for 50 minutes. “We show here that working-memory decline in people in their 60s and 70s is due to brain circuits becoming uncoupled, or disconnected,” said Dr. Reinhart, in a call with reporters. He added that the findings “show us that negative, age-related changes in working memory are not unchangeable. We can bring back the superior function you had when you were much younger.” The tACS tuning prompted greater improvements in older people than in younger ones, the study found, which suggests that the tool is more a corrective than an enhancer of memory. In another experiment, Dr. Reinhart and Dr. Nguyen found that, by using the tACS technology to decouple key brain regions, they could temporarily muddle the working memory of young participants. The new findings come at a time when increasing numbers of people are experimenting with brain stimulation at home, placing electrodes on different areas of their skull, depending on how they’re feeling. They share tips online about how best to use stimulation when feeling depressed, or impulsive, or mentally foggy — with mixed results. Experts said that the sort of stimulation used in the new study is far from a do-it-yourself approach. “Reinhart and Nguyen use a very complex, sophisticated system here in a very carefully controlled environment,” Bradley Voytek, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, said in an email. “Do not try this at home! This is a promising start, not a panacea for memory problems.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/health/aging-brain-memory.html,health,The New York Times,health,831

Of the 47 analysts with ratings on Amazon, 45 (or 96 percent) say analysts should keep accumulating the shares, according to FactSet. That's the highest ratio of buy recommendations among the 10 most valuable U.S. tech companies. Apple, which last month became the first U.S. company to eclipse the $1 trillion barrier, has a buy rating from just 62 percent of analysts. The level of Amazon bullishness is yet another sign that Wall Street is willing to pay up more for growth than profit, particularly when it comes to a company with so many engines for expansion. ""AMZN is a consensus long and has the least amount of debate of the mega-cap internet stocks,"" wrote Rob Sanderson, an analyst at MKM Partners, in a report on Aug. 22. Sanderson said Amazon Web Services is ""in a sweet-spot for margin expansion"" and sees the company making a big splash in grocery delivery. From Amazon's dominance in online retail and its expansion into private labels to the rapid growth of AWS and the penetration of the Alexa assistant into more areas of our personal and professional lives, Amazon is everywhere. Sales in the latest quarter jumped 39 percent, more than double Apple's 17 percent growth rate. Apple is much more profitable than Amazon. The iPhone maker recorded an operating margin of 24 percent in the latest period, while Amazon's was 5.6 percent. Analyst price targets on Amazon have yet to catch up with their ratings. The average 12-month price prediction for Amazon shares is $2,142.64, according to FactSet, which is only about a 5 percent increase from here.

2016-09-29 00:00:00,2016,9.0,29,Uber wants to let brands feed you content during your next ride,"Uber is partnering with Yext, a New York-based startup that specializes in location data for businesses, to help online shoppers book rides to their favorite store or restaurant. The partnership will also allow corporations to serve up marketing material and ads to consumers on Uber’s platform. Depending on your point of view, that will either be super helpful or super annoying. The announcement is an extension of Uber’s decision to open its application program interface (API) software to third-party developers. Since then, a variety of businesses have taken advantage, including Google Maps, Open Table, and Trip Advisor. The partnership with Yext will allow national chains like Guitar Center or footwear brands like Cole Haan to add a “Call me an Uber” button to their homepage or marketing emails. A customer shopping for a new Fender can click on the Uber button to book a ride to the closest Guitar Center. Yext promises its location data ensures users are dropped off at the right spot, and not a mailing location or parking lot. But be forewarned, by clicking on that button, you’ll authorize Guitar Center to serve up ads, discount offerings, and other content through the Uber app during your ride. Yext is calling this type of deluge of marketing “trip branding,” which may turn some consumers off — though probably not the type of person that would order an Uber through a retail store’s website. “If they open the Uber app in the car, [they will] see a banner across the bottom linking to content relevant to the place they're going — food menu, hotel concierge service, etc,” a Yext spokesperson said in an emailed statement to The Verge. “As this evolves, we're imagining options like a bar giving people the ability to buy a round while on their way. So it's added functionality within the Uber app for customers who are interested in it for their destination.” Chris Saad, head of product for Uber’s developer platform, said in a statement the partnership will help businesses “take all the friction out of bringing customers to their doorstep."" In other words, Uber wants to be your de facto transportation option when you want to go shopping. This latest feature builds on Uber’s so-called “Trip Experiences” the company announced at the beginning of the year. Trip Experiences allows third-party apps, with the user's permission, to serve up a variety of content during that user's Uber trip, based on the specific details of each ride. Update, September 30th 10:21AM ET: A spokesperson from Uber sent us an email to clarify the company’s position on third-party advertisements: “Per our Uber API Terms of Use, developers are not allowed to use the Uber​ ​API/Materials to distribute unsolicited advertising or promotions to users,” she wrote. “When and only when users request rides from the Yext-powered Ride Request button, businesses can display valuable information to enhance their journey or prepare them for their arrival. The hope is not to irritate them — they are their own customers after all.”",https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/29/13096252/uber-yext-brand-content-api-integrate,Tech,The Verge,technology,502
2018-05-17 00:00:00,2018,5.0,17,Backstory: Calculating the gender gap in the technology sector,"NEW YORK - As she reported on sexual harassment issues at big companies, Jennifer Saba, a Breakingviews columnist, looked for a concrete way to quantify the gender gap in the technology sector. Saba decided to focus on Facebook (FB.O), Google (GOOGL.O) and Apple since all of the Silicon Valley companies have a predominately male workforce and publish reams of data on hiring practices. That data is at the core of the latest Breakingviews calculator, which crunches the numbers and finds that it could take nearly a decade or longer to reach gender parity at Facebook, Google and Apple. (here Users can input data on their employers to see how long it would take for women to make up half of a company’s workforce. Since 2012, Breakingviews has created more than 40 calculators, looking at such topics as the true cost of Brexit (here) and how much bond investors would lose as interest rates rose (here). Working with U.S. editor John Foley and graphics editor Vincent Flasseur, Saba reached out to the three companies to understand the factors behind a male-dominated workforce. Since the companies would not divulge employee turnover, Saba used a baseline assumption of 20 percent, broadly in line with the technology industry. She also looked at current female workforce, female new hires and workforce annual growth. “Simplicity makes it sharp,” Saba said. The calculator demonstrated that at Apple and Google it would take 14 and 15 years, respectively, for women to comprise half the workforce. At Facebook, it would take seven years. “All three companies have such an incredible impact in the world, yet they have a dearth of women employees,” Saba said. “A company should reflect its customer, at the very least.” Reporting by Lauren Young",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-backstory-breakingviews-calculator/backstory-calculating-the-gender-gap-in-the-technology-sector-idUSKCN1II2WW,Technology News,Reuters,technology,289
2017-08-08 00:00:00,2017,8.0,8,People with Depression Tend to Post Darker Instagrams ," Carefully curated Instagram feeds can convince you everyone you know is living an idyllic, glamorous life. But under closer inspection, photos that are bluer, darker, or less-saturated might reveal a struggle with mental health, according to a new study published today in  EPJ Data Science.  A group of 166 people were recruited for the study, 71 of whom had been diagnosed with depression. These participants handed over access to their private Instagram accounts, comprising a pool of more than 43,000 photos.   The researchers then had a computer model analyze the photos pixel-by-pixel for color, metadata, and face detection, and then use its observations to predict which users had depression and which didn't. It didn't consider any related text, like captions and comments. The model correctly identified the people with depression 70 percent of the time—that's better than the average primary care doctor, who correctly diagnose depression about 50 percent of the time, according to previous studies.   ""We were looking to identify what behaviors are people exhibiting potentially without them even realizing,"" Chris Danforth, an advanced computing professor at the University of Vermont and co-author of the study, told Motherboard. The computer model identified a number of trends among Instagram users with depression. Their photos tended to be bluer, darker, and grayer, unfiltered, have more comments, and fewer likes. When they did use a filter, they preferred the black-and-white lens of Inkwell, while the control group greatly preferred warm, sunny Valencia (the authors created an illustration to show the difference, which is at the top of this post). Blue bars indicate disproportionate use of an Instagram filter by depressed compared to healthy participants, orange bars indicate the reverse. Image: Reece and Danforth/  Individuals with depression were also more likely to post photos with faces, but had a lower average face count per photo.   A statistical analysis of these correlations showed a pretty strong relationship, but Danforth cautioned that this was a small, specific group, and the results should be taken with a grain of salt.   ""It's a proof of concept and for the particular individuals we studied, this set of predictors works for them,"" Danforth said. ""Whether or not it would translate to average person's Instagram feed, we don't know.""   But this does add to the growing research that analyzes social media to make predictions about mental health. One study was able to identify mothers at risk for postpartum depression based on their social media posts with 71 percent accuracy. Others have used metadata like the number of tweets someone sends in a day to identify risks of depression. And there's a decent body of evidence that show people who have depression more closely associate with darker colors, and can be less sensitive to color, seeing the world as more grey.   Danforth said more research should be done to see if these predictors are accurate to a wider population, which may make a useful tool for doctors hoping to get quicker and more accurate diagnoses.   Does it mean if your friend posts all black-and-white Instagrams he or she is definitely suffering from depression? Nah. But when taken in the context of the comprehensive data that we're all pumping out into social media on the daily, it could help give some clues about what's going on beyond the lens.

2016-03-13 00:00:00,2016,3.0,13,Lassa fever patient in treatment at Emory," (CNN)A Lassa fever diagnosis has been confirmed for a patient at Emory University Hospital, a CDC spokesman told CNN on Sunday. Test results for the patient ""were positive for Lassa fever,"" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman Benjamin Hayes said. Doctors had suspected the patient, an American physician assistant who'd been working with a missionary organization in Togo, had the virus. At the request of the U.S. State Department, the individual was transported from West Africa to the Atlanta hospital for treatment.  The patient is being treated at the university's Serious Communicable Diseases Unit, where four U.S. patients were treated for Ebola in 2014.   ""We are continuing to treat the patient for symptoms of febrile illness,"" Emory spokeswoman Holly Korschun said. What is Lassa fever? Lassa fever is a virus spread by rats that is endemic in Sierra Leone, Liberia, New Guinea and Nigeria, according to the CDC.  Symptoms can be similar to Ebola, including hemorrhagic fever and bleeding, although 80% of patients experience mild symptoms and can even go undiagnosed, according to the World Health Organization.  Lassa fever is deadly in about 1% of all individuals. Among those who require hospitalization for their illness, 15% do not survive.  New Jersey man dies of Lassa fever  Unlike Ebola, Lassa fever is not spread from person to person. People become infected from contact with urine or feces of an infected rat, which sometimes happens from food. Breathing particles in the air from infected rat feces can also lead to infection. Coming into direct contact with bodily fluids from an infected person can also lead to infection, although this is rare.  Symptoms begin one to three weeks after a person is infected.  The virus can be treated with the antiviral drug Ribavirin.  Lassa fever infects an estimated 100,000 to 300,000 people in West Africa each year and is responsible for 5,000 deaths.   There have only been six cases of Lassa fever in the United States, according to the CDC. All were infected while traveling to countries where the virus was spreading.  The most recent case was in May 2015, when a man who had returned from traveling to Liberia died from Lassa fever in a New Jersey hospital.  CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/13/health/lassa-fever-emory-atlanta/index.html,health,CNN,health,375
2019-10-10 00:00:00,2019,10.0,10,Former FEC Chairman Lee Goodman on Facebook political ad policy,"Facebook should not be tasked with determining the truthfulness of political campaign ads, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission told CNBC on Thursday. Lee Goodman — a Republican who led the FEC during Barack Obama's presidency — was reacting to the social network's decision to reject a Biden campaign request to remove an advertisement from President Donald Trump's campaign containing unproven information. Other tech companies like Twitter and Google's YouTube were running the Trump ad. CNN refused to run it. The Trump ad claims that former Vice President Joe Biden ""offered Ukraine $1 billion to fire the prosecutor investigating a company affiliated with his son."" The Biden campaign said the claim should be covered by Facebook's pledge to reject political ads with ""previously debunked content."" Trump's July phone call asking Ukraine's president to investigate the Bidens is central to the impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats. ""Facebook, like all publishers, has to have reasonable editorial standards,"" Goodman said on ""Squawk Box."" ""What we're seeing here is an exercise of their editorial freedom to feature candidate ads without fact-checking and allow the political process to be the arbiter of truth and falsity in political advertising by the candidates themselves."" The global elections policy chief at Facebook wrote a letter to Biden's campaign, which was originally obtained by The New York Times. The letter said the social network's approach to political ads is ""grounded in Facebook's fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is. ... Thus, when a politician speaks or makes an ad, we do not send it to third party fact checkers."" Facebook will be ""condemned"" either way, Goodman said, even though the company ""doesn't want to be the arbiter and doesn't want to take sides in these political debates."" ""Their stated policy, I think, is fair,"" Goodman said, adding Facebook is avoiding refereeing ""truth or falsity, opinion versus fact, candidate versus candidate debates"" by taking a hands-off approach. Facebook — which declined to comment after the letter surfaced — has worked to improve its advertising disclosures after government officials concluded Russians used the platform to influence the 2016 election. In late August, the company tightened its verification process that requires people who want to run ads to prove they are in the U.S., and to confirm their group's identity through a tax identification number or a government ID. — CNBC's Lauren Feiner contributed reporting.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/10/former-fec-chairman-lee-goodman-on-facebook-political-ad-policy.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,421

2019-12-20 19:19:00,2019,12.0,20,Lawyer Who Told ‘Cumstain’ Opposing Counsel to ‘Pay Up Fuckface’ Is Off the Case," California lawyer Christopher Hook is in trouble this week after telling a U.S. District Judge he wouldn’t give up his law license after sending threatening emails to rival counsel and telling them to “eat a bowl of dicks.” Hook was set to appear in court to show cause for his bad behavior in an insurance coverage dispute case between his clients and Allstate. Hook’s former clients are suing the insurance company, saying Allstate has failed to fulfill its obligation to them. At the core of the disagreement is $200,000 in water damages. Hook pursued the money with reckless abandon, highly entertaining and very rude court documents reveal. “I understand the position you are in,” Hook wrote to opposing counsel Peter Klee on November 22. “I'm going to let the long dick of the law fuck Allstate for all of us.” “Hey Klee you Cumstain the demand is now 302 million. Pay up fuckface,” Hook wrote on November 23. “Peter when you are done fellating your copy boy tell Allstate the demand is now 305 million,” he wrote hours later. “Hey shit for brains Allstate owes my clients a lot of money,” he wrote the next day. “It's due yesterday.” “Tell Allstate I am going to water board each one of their trolls that show up for [deposition] without any mercy whatsoever,” he wrote at 6:10 AM. “You think you are better than me, that you are too good to even pick up the phone and exchange thoughts with me,” Hook sent at 8:20 PM the same day. “Well karma is a bitch mother fucker. You are going to learn that in spades. I know where you live pete.” The next day, Hook sent Klee personal information indicating he did, indeed, know where lived. “Tell [redacted] it is going to be sold to pay for my clients and you guys can rent a place in lemon grove,” referring to a San Diego suburb. Hook’s clients have new lawyers now, and all parties had gathered in a California courtroom of U.S. District Judge Otis Wright to discuss Hook’s behavior, but the lawyer was nowhere to be seen. As the proceedings dragged on, Judge Wright told Hook’s former clients that he wouldn’t dismiss their case. That’s when Hook jumped up from the courtroom audience. Judge Wright was pissed. “Were you hiding?” he said, according to ABA Journal. “Were you waiting to make a fashionable entrance?” According to law.com, Judge Wright and Hook traded words and Wright demanded Hook give up his license to practice law. “I will not do that,” Hook said. “Shut up,” Judge Wright said. “I want you to resign from this profession.” As of this writing, Hook is still allowed to practice law in the state of California. There is no word on whether or not he went “batshit crazy on you mother fucking cock suckers,” as he promised to do in a November 23 email to Allstate’s lawyers.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z3bepe/lawyer-who-told-cumstain-opposing-counsel-to-pay-up-fuckface-is-off-the-case,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,489
2016-04-21 00:00:00,2016,4.0,21,"If parents see kids as overweight, they're more likely to be"," (CNN)One way health programs today are trying to reduce the growing problem of childhood obesity in the United States is by making parents aware that their child is overweight. The thinking is they can take steps to help their child eat more healthily and exercise more.  But a new study has turned that thinking on its head. Researchers found that young children were actually more likely to gain weight during childhood if their parents thought they were overweight.  The study monitored more than 3,500 Australian children and found that those who were overweight when they were 4 or 5 years old, and whose parents viewed them as overweight, gained significantly more weight by their 13th birthday. This added gain is in comparison to children who were overweight, but whose parents thought they were actually normal weight or underweight.  ""In this case, misperception may be protective,"" said Angelina R. Sutin, who led the research published Thursday in the journal Pediatrics. The team determined the body mass index, or BMI, of the children at 4 or 5 years of age and asked one of their parents, in most cases their mother, if they thought their child was underweight, normal weight or overweight. The researchers then measured the child's BMI every other year until they were 13. Children who were normal weight or underweight also gained more weight at every two-year interval if their parents had mistakenly perceived them as overweight. Why the children gained weight Sutin believes the reason behind this could be that parents who thought their children were overweight, regardless of whether they actually were, could have been limiting how much their kids ate and the kids could have rebelled by eating more. Alternatively, these parents may have shamed their children about their weight, which could have led them to overeat or avoid physical activity.  Neither possibility could be tested with the data available from the Australian study, Sutin added. There is some evidence supporting the second possibility, at least among adolescents and adults. One study found that girls who had been told they were ""too fat"" by a parent, sibling or peer when they were 10 years old, whether or not they actually were overweight, were more likely to be obese at 19 years. Further research among adults suggests those who label themselves as overweight are more likely to gain weight in subsequent years. But further evidence is needed. ""It is hard to imagine how these mechanisms would play out in the young children in this study,"" said Dr. William Dietz, chair of the Sumner M. Redstone Global Center for Prevention and Wellness at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. ""Parents rarely tell a 5-year-old they have a weight problem,"" said Dietz, adding that it would be unlikely for a young child to rebel against their parents' efforts to limit calories. Dietz believes a more likely scenario is that factors other than parental perception could have contributed to weight gain. For example, the group of children who were overweight and correctly categorized as overweight by their parents could have been more severely overweight than the children who were overweight, but not perceived as overweight. ""(The children who are more overweight) could have already been on an increased trajectory of weight gain,"" Dietz said.  Parents might have been more aware of their child being overweight if they were overweight themselves, and parents who are overweight could be raising children in homes where there is a higher risk of being overweight and obese, with more overeating and less physical exercise, added Dr. Jian Zhang, associate professor of epidemiology at Georgia Southern University's Jiann-Ping Hsu College of Public Health. Zhang has led research examining parents' ability to recognize if their children are overweight, but was not involved in the current research.  Although the study corrected for the parents' BMI and still found the link between parent perception and weight gain, ""we cannot rule out the possibility that (it) may explain a large part of the weird observation,"" Zhang said. It is also important to know how parents that saw their child as overweight felt about it, and whether they were concerned, Dietz said. For example, parents who are overweight themselves and have experienced poor health outcomes as a result might be more willing to make an effort to reduce their child's weight, he added. The Australian study did not measure parents' attitudes about being overweight or obesity, or their own health.  Do parents recognize their child is overweight? Recent research in the United States shined an unflattering light on parents and their inability to recognize when their child is overweight, with parents today seeming to be even worse at it than a decade ago. This change could possibly have happened because overweight and obesity among children has become the norm, rather than the exception.  About 32% of children and teenagers, ages 2 to 19, were overweight in 2012 and about 17% were obese in the United States. Parents in the Australian study also fared poorly. Out of the 3,357 children in the study, 703 were overweight, but only 131 (almost 20%) of them were correctly perceived as overweight by their parents. The remaining 563 were seen as normal weight and nine were seen as underweight. Should parents be informed about their child's weight? Given the limitations of the study, it is too soon to conclude that efforts to inform parents about their child's weight are futile and current efforts should continue. One such effort is now in place in 21 states across the United States, where schools assess students' weight, usually by measuring BMI, and share these weight reports with parents.   Some parents have been ""furious, and rightly so,"" about these reports, Dietz said. Parents felt like they were being blamed for their child's weight and ordered to ""do something about it,"" while the school system did not take any responsibility for their role in preventing excessive weight gain in children, he added. It is important to provide parents with information about their child's weight, and a growing number of pediatricians are accordingly doing BMI screening during wellness visits, Dietz said. However, context makes all the difference. Physicians and public health officials need to do a better job of communicating the health risks of obesity -- which includes diabetes -- rather than just telling people a BMI range to aim for, Dietz said. Zhang believes it is also important to reduce the stigma about weight among parents, and help them understand that overweight and obesity in children is preventable and reversible, Zhang added. ""As parents, we should foster a pro-health family environment rather than be over-preoccupied by weight watching,"" Zhang said.

2017-06-26 00:00:00,2017,6.0,26,California to list herbicide as cancer-causing; Monsanto vows fight,"(Reuters) - Glyphosate, an herbicide and the active ingredient in Monsanto Co’s popular Roundup weed killer, will be added to California’s list of chemicals known to cause cancer effective July 7, the state’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) said on Monday. Monsanto vowed to continue its legal fight against the designation, required under a state law known as Proposition 65, and called the decision “unwarranted on the basis of science and the law.” The listing is the latest legal setback for the seeds and chemicals company, which has faced increasing litigation over glyphosate since the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer said that it is “probably carcinogenic” in a controversial ruling in 2015. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that the scientist leading the IARC’s review knew of fresh data showing no link between glyphosate and cancer. But he never mentioned it, and the agency did not take the information into account because it had yet to be published in a scientific journal. The IARC classed glyphosate as a “probable carcinogen,”  the only major health regulator to do so. Dicamba, a weed killer designed for use with Monsanto’s next generation of biotech crops, is under scrutiny in Arkansas after the state’s plant board voted last week to ban the chemical. OEHHA said the designation of glyphosate under Proposition 65 will proceed following an unsuccessful attempt by Monsanto to block the listing in trial court and after requests for stay were denied by a state appellate court and the California’s Supreme Court. Monsanto’s appeal of the trial court’s ruling is pending. “This is not the final step in the process, and it has no bearing on the merits of the case. We will continue to aggressively challenge this improper decision,” Scott Partridge, Monsanto’s vice president of global strategy, said. Listing glyphosate as a known carcinogen under California’s Proposition 65 would require companies selling the chemical in the state to add warning labels to packaging. Warnings would also be required if glyphosate is being sprayed at levels deemed unsafe by regulators. Users of the chemical include landscapers, golf courses, orchards, vineyards and farms. Monsanto and other glyphosate producers would have roughly a year from the listing date to re-label products or remove them from store shelves if further legal challenges are lost. Monsanto has not calculated the cost of any re-labeling effort and does not break out glyphosate sales data by state, Partridge said. Environmental groups cheered OEHHA’s move to list the chemical. “California’s decision makes it the national leader in protecting people from cancer-causing pesticides,” said Nathan Donley, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity.

""They need to have some kind of good quality product out in the market,"" he said. The South Korean electronics giant announced early Tuesday morning that it would ask all of its global partners to stop sales and exchanges of the Note 7 as it investigates overheating issues in the devices. It also warned all users to power down their devices. This followed the company's recall of the original Note 7 model due to problems with a flammable battery, and multiple reports that the supposedly safe replacement handsets given to users were also overheating. Major U.S. and Australian mobile carriers have suspended or halted sales of Note 7s, and on Monday Reuters reported that the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards had confirmed that there were possible defects in the replacement smartphones. ""Samsung totally botched this. To have this get out the first time is obviously a quality control problem ... and then to have the recall botched, to me is completely inexcusable,"" Robinson said. Samsung had consolidated its position in recent months as the world's largest smartphone maker by shipment volume, aided by the success of its Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge smartphones, while the Note 7, introduced in August, was expected to continue that positive trend. The giant recall came as competitors heaped extra pressure on the South Korean giant, with the launch of Apple's iPhone 7 and Google's Pixel into the already fiercely competitive high-end smartphone market. Bradley Gastwirth, CEO at ABR Investment Strategy, told CNBC's ""Street Signs "" that Samsung's failure to arrest the problem with its replacement Note 7s would probably affect sentiment towards its other models, with users likely be more skeptical over the reliability of new Samsung handsets. ""This has gotten a lot worse than I think anybody would have ever imagined within the company,"" he said. Samsung has not revealed the exact nature of the problem that caused its devices to overheat. In an emailed response to CNBC's query, Samsung said it was ""temporarily adjusting the Galaxy Note 7 schedule in order to take further steps to ensure quality and safety matters."" Analysts have, however, pointed out that while Samsung's mobile business would likely feel the brunt of the Note 7 recall in the short term, it would not significantly affect the company's overall business due to strong growth in its components business. The components business includes semiconductor and display technology. In a Friday regulatory filing, Samsung said its July-September profit was likely to be 7.8 trillion won ($7 billion), a touch higher than the 7.4 trillion won tipped by a Thomson Reuters StarMine SmartEstimate average of analysts' forecasts. The Nomura analysts said that while Samsung would face further earnings impact and damage to its brand image if it did drop the Note 7 altogether, the company's overall fiscal 2017 outlook was solid. ""Even if we factor in the worst-case scenario for Note 7, we think Samsung's overall 2017 operating profit is still likely to grow 30 percent year-on-year to 37.6 trillion won and surpass the all-time high of 36.8 trillion won in 2013,"" Chung and Chang said in their note. — Follow CNBC International on and Facebook.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/11/samsung-news-galaxy-note-7-problem-could-hit-samsungs-marketshare.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,679

2019-09-06 00:00:00,2019,9.0,6,Telenav says contract with GM intact after automaker signs Google deal,"(Reuters) - Telenav Inc said on Thursday General Motors Co’s partnership with Alphabet’s Google to power its vehicles’ navigation and other infotainment functions does not alter its contract with the carmaker. General Motors (GM) said on Thursday it will use embedded Google technology to power navigation, voice activated controls and other vehicle infotainment functions starting in 2021, in a win for Alphabet Inc in the race with Amazon.com and other technology companies to control dashboards. Telenav, which provides navigation services to automakers such as Ford Motor Co and General Motors, said it does not expect GM’s decision to affect its internal operating forecasts for fiscal years 2020 and 2021. “Telenav has a strong and ongoing relationship with GM, with a contract effective through model year 2025,” the company said. The Santa Clara, California-based company, which has been gaining market share within GM, indicated that the trend of increasing revenue from the automaker could stop after 2022. The company generated 18% of its revenue in fiscal 2019 from the U.S.-based carmaker. “Telenav has been gaining market share within GM while increasing revenue from GM, and Telenav expects this trend to continue up to the model year 2022,” Telenav said in a statement. General Motors has no obligatory purchase requirements from Telenav under the contract ending 2025, the navigation solution provider said. The agreement states that GM can offer Telenav’s navigation solution in its vehicles through 2025. Telenav shares plunged as much as 48.4% following GM’s announcement.

2019-07-25 00:00:00,2019,7.0,25,Britain's O2 to launch 5G mobile network in October,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s O2 mobile phone network, owned by Spain’s Telefonica, said on Thursday it would launch next generation 5G services in October, and will be live in 20 towns and cities by the end of the year and in 50 by next summer. Rivals EE and Vodafone have recently started 5G services, and Hutchison’s Three is set to follow in August. London, Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, London and Slough will be the first locations to benefit from the services, O2 said. Customers need to buy 5G compatible smartphones to use the ultrafast services, which typically currently offer speeds 20 times faster than 4G. O2 and Vodafone on Wednesday agreed to extend their network sharing agreement to help speed up the deployment of 5G. The deal enables the companies to share equipment, such as radio antennas, on joint network sites across the UK. The companies will have autonomy to install their own equipment at 25% of the sites while sharing the mast. In addition, they said they would press ahead with exploring potential monetization options for the joint venture, such as potential third-party investors. Vodafone Chief Executive Nick Read has stated he wants to make better use of the company’s masts across Europe by encouraging rival operators to use them or selling stakes in the infrastructure. Separately on Thursday British telecoms regulator Ofcom said it would open up more airwaves that had been licensed to mobile companies but which were not being used by them for local use by other parties. Ofcom’s spectrum group director Philip Marnick said: “Our new sharing approach will help more people access airwaves to create local networks around the UK.” “The benefits of this innovation could extend across our economy, from farms to factories, as well as supporting new technology firms.” Reporting by Paul Sandle; editing by David Evans",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-5g-telefonica/britains-o2-to-launch-5g-mobile-network-in-october-idUSKCN1UK21F,Technology News,Reuters,technology,305
2020-02-11 00:00:00,2020,2.0,11,"Lyft forecasts slower growth in 2020, leaves target profit date unchanged","(Reuters) - Lyft Inc (LYFT.O) on Tuesday forecast slower revenue growth in the new year and the company refused to match larger rival Uber, which recently moved up a key profit target by a year, sticking to its later date of projected profitability. Investors were left disappointed, sending shares down 5.5% after hours. While Lyft reported record quarterly revenue of more than $1 billion, it failed to change its target to achieve profitability on an adjusted basis by the end of 2021. This was in contrast to its larger rival Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N), which last week moved its own profitability target, previously the same as Lyft’s, to the fourth quarter of 2020. Analysts during an investor call repeatedly pressed the company on prospects for profitability, leading Lyft executives to defend their target and insist the company was on the right track. “We remain truly confident we can achieve our Q4 ‘21 target,” Chief Financial Officer Brian Roberts said. Lyft reported revenue of $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter, ahead of analysts who expected $984 million in quarterly revenue, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. For now, the company continues to make losses, reporting a fourth-quarter net loss of $356 million, or a loss of $1.19 per share, narrower than analyst estimates for a $1.38 loss per share. Lyft operates only in the United States and some Canadian cities. Its active rider customer base in the fourth quarter grew to 22.9 million from 22.3 million the previous quarter. That compares with Uber’s global 111 million active platform users in the same period. While Lyft’s ridership grew by more than 6% in the first half of 2019, growth in the second half slowed to around 2.5%. The company said it expects an adjusted EBITDA loss of between $450 million and $490 million for all of 2020. “Lyft’s problem is that its smaller scale means that profitability is harder to achieve than it is for Uber,” said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell. The adjusted EBITDA profitability metric at both companies excludes expenses for stock-based compensation and other items. Share-based payments at Uber in all of 2019 amounted to nearly $4.6 billion, or roughly a third of revenue. Lyft’s stock-based compensation came in at $1.6 billion for all of 2019, or 44% of full-year revenue. Both companies went public last year, Lyft in March, Uber in May, with many early employees and investors selling their shares. CFO Roberts in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday said 2020 created the foundation for “more durable growth” in 2021 and beyond. Uber and Lyft, both based in San Francisco, are pursuing different roads in search of profitability, with Uber pouring money into side businesses which have so far lost money and Lyft remaining focused solely on moving people around. Lyft in January cut 2% of its workforce in its sales and marketing department to achieve its profitability target, but said it plans to hire more people this year. The company is still spending heavily, with total costs in 2019 growing to $6.3 billion. Lyft executives said on Tuesday the company was committed to its “low-cost culture” with employees, including executives and board members, flying in coach class. Uber and Lyft have historically relied on heavy subsidies to attract riders. Lyft in October said a growing number of customers were paying full price, with discounts and promotional incentives decreasing. Roberts on Tuesday said Lyft aimed for further cuts to marketing spending as a percentage of revenue in 2020. “We want to win on innovation, customer experience and brand reputation, not on coupons or discounts,” he said. But Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi told investors during an earnings call on Thursday that Lyft over the past month or so had been more aggressive in giving out discounts to attract customers. Lyft also said a restructuring of its insurance policies would improve contribution margins, but did not elaborate. Cost of revenue, which includes insurance expenses, accounted for roughly 37% of Lyft’s 2019 costs.

2016-02-29 20:28:00,2016,2.0,29,Humans Trust Robots In a Simulated Emergency—Even When the Robot Is Wrong,"Turns out our implicit assumption that robots know better than we do could put us in danger. A study by researchers at Georgia Tech Research Institute showed that in a simulated emergency, people were willing to override their own common sense to follow a robot to safety.  In the experiment, students were seated in a waiting room and instructed to fill out a form. Eventually, the hall outside the room filled with smoke and an alarm sounded. The student then had to decide whether to leave the way they came, or follow a robot indicating a previously unknown route.  The sample size of the study was small, with only 30 participants, but the results surprised the researchers. Twenty-six of the 30 students who participated in the study chose to follow the robot, despite the presence of a clearly marked exit that was already known to them.  Graduate student Paul Robinette, who led the study, expected altogether different results. As he told New Scientist, ""We thought that there wouldn't be enough trust, and that we'd have to do something to prove the robot was trustworthy."" But even if the robot made an error and led students into a conference room first, people continued to follow its directions until it led them to an exit.  But the strength of the results may have been partly attributable to the fact that the robot was wearing a sign designating it as an ""emergency response robot."" Several participants cited this as a reason for their trust in an exit survey.  The study is the first to examine trust between robots and humans in an emergency setting, and is only part of a planned suite of research to come on the subject. But senior research engineer Alan Wagner says the Georgia Tech team might have to change tacks after these results. ""We wanted to ask the question about whether people would be willing to trust these rescue robots,"" said Wagner. ""A more important question now might be to ask how to prevent them from trusting these robots too much.""

2016-03-04 21:10:00,2016,3.0,4,Scott Kelly’s Year In Space Convinced Him We Need to Save the Planet,"After 340 days aboard the International Space Station—the longest stretch for any NASA astronaut—recent ISS Commander Scott Kelly is back on Earth and reflecting on his year in orbit. During a press conference on Friday, the astronaut shared his thoughts on a manned mission to Mars, the utility of virtual reality in space, and how staring down at the Earth for a year changes your view on environmentalism. Though there are still a year's worth of physical tests ahead of him and his twin brother, Mark, and much analysis to be done before we start to understand the true impact of living in zero gravity for close to 12 months, Kelly was able to share some first impressions after arriving back home Wednesday. ""The only big surprise was how long a year is,"" Kelly said about the mission. ""It seemed like I had lived there forever. It seemed longer than I thought it would be."" Kelly said that, compared to the shorter stints he had done aboard the ISS, he was feeling more intense physical shocks after coming back to Earth this time. He said he is experiencing more severe muscle soreness and fatigue and that his skin has become extremely sensitive, to the point where even clothing and shoes can cause a burning sensation. Kelly also said he thinks his coordination is a bit off as he adjusts back to life with gravity, noting some trouble he had shooting basketballs Thursday. But he also felt confident that a longer spaceflight would be completely reasonable for any properly trained astronaut. ""I personally think going to Mars, if it takes two years or two and a half years, yeah that's doable,"" Kelly said about a potential manned mission to the Red Planet. ""Certainly the first people that go there, that's going to be a big motivator: being first to go to Mars."" One point Kelly made more than once was that his time in space gave him a new concern for the environment. He noted that, from the vantage point of the ISS, he could observe numerous environmental impacts—pollution in parts of Asia, wildfires in California—as well as the notably thin atmosphere. ""You just notice how thin the atmosphere is, how fragile it looks, and that combined with large swaths of pollution is somewhat alarming,"" Kelly said. ""We've got to take care of the environment. People say 'save the planet,' but the planet will be just fine. It's us that's going to have a problem."" While on board, the crew conducted a number of experiments, including testing out a HoloLens device. Kelly said he believes augmented reality and virtual reality technology could be a major asset for space work, especially when connected to the support team on Earth. A maintenance procedure, for example, could be performed wearing augmented reality goggles with the instructions right in front of the astronaut's eyes, and the ability for remote experts to highlight specific tools or elements. Kelly said the goggles they tested were also equipped with an alien invasion video game, which for some reason didn't freak out any of the crew. ""It actually has a game on it where there are alien spaceships coming inside the space station and you gotta shoot 'em with your finger,"" Kelly said. ""We were playing around with that and it didn't seem to make anyone sick. It was kind of fun."" After he landed back on Earth, his first meal was a ripe banana—a choice he later realized was particularly appropriate given his recent gorilla suit appearance on the ISS—and when he finally got back to his home in Texas after traveling from Kazakhstan where the Soyuz capsule landed, he hopped in his pool: Great to be back on Scott KellyMarch 3, 2016 ""You want to get that water around you,"" he said. ""We make due with not having a shower on board and it's not like you feel dirty, but you definitely feel like you would like to jump in a pool. So I did.""

2020-01-29 00:00:00,2020,1.0,29,"Bats, the source of so many viruses, could be the origin of Wuhan coronavirus, say experts"," (CNN)Scientists have said that a type of snake may be the original source of the Wuhan coronavirus. However, other infectious disease experts say the ultimate culprit is more likely to be the bat.  ""When you look at the genetic sequence of the virus, and you match it up with every known coronavirus, the closest relatives are from bats,"" said Dr. Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, an environmental health non-profit. Professor Guizhen Wu of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said in a study released by the Lancet medical journal on Wednesday that the data they had so far was consistent with the virus being initially hosted by bats. The bat has long been seen as a biological super villain.  The winged mammal has been the reservoir for several different deadly viruses like Marburg, Nipah and Hendra, which have caused disease in humans and outbreaks in Uganda, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Australia. Bats are thought to be the natural host of the Ebola virus, rabies, SARS and MERS, with the latter two both coronaviruses similar to the one that's now emerged in Wuhan. Often, there's an intermediary involved as was the case with SARS in 2003 — the civet cat — and MERS, which emerged later in the 2000s and was carried by camels.  Scientists call these viruses zoonotic because they are transmitted from animals to humans. In the case of Nipah virus, which can cause a range of symptoms including fatal encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), infections were traced back to juice made from the sap of a date palm tree that had been contaminated by bat urine or saliva. Bats had been roosting in the trees where locals set up spigots to collect the tasty sap.  The fact this new coronavirus has been linked to bats ""comes as no surprise to virologists working on bat-borne viruses,"" said Dr Stathis Giotis, a virologist at the Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial College in London. ""Bats are recognized as important reservoirs for emerging and re-emerging viruses with zoonotic potential."" Giotis said that it was possible that the Chinese horseshoe bat, a common bat species in China, was responsible. Why are bats so adept at harboring and spreading viruses? Bats are a diverse group, with more than 1,300 species, are second only to rodents in mammal diversity. They are geographically diverse, living on every continent except Antarctica. Compared with terrestrial animals, they have a longer lifespan and many roost densely with millions of others in caves, meaning they potentially come into contact with more viruses and they circulate easily between them.  While bats are known to carry several high-profile viruses, they don't seem to suffer from them — with the exception of rabies.  One theory posits that flight, which is shared by all bats but no other mammals, has allowed bats to evolve mechanisms that protect them from viruses. Flying elevates the bat's metabolism and body temperature — similar to a fever in humans and other mammals — and scientists say this, on an evolutionary scale, could boost a bat's immune system and make it more tolerant of viruses.  ""The current hypothesis among scientists is that the bat immune system has been adapted over centuries of evolution due to their flying ability,"" said Giotis. Scientists have found some promising leads in the animal's genetic make-up to back up this hypothesis.   ""Key antiviral immunity components are conserved in bats, but some genes that activate inflammation or specialized-antiviral defense mechanisms are either missing or have altered function,"" said Giotis, explaining why they don't have a typical immune response to viruses. Of course, bats aren't the only animals that carry disease that spills over into humans. The plague was carried by rodents and HIV spilled over from chimpanzees.  Scientists in a 2017 paper did find that bats harbored more dangerous viruses than other species. A team of scientists including Daszak looked at 188 known zoonotic viruses and found that bats hosted a ""significantly higher"" proportion of these than other mammals. However, some scientists say that bats have been more extensively sampled for viruses in the wake of the 2003 SARS outbreak and that other animals may have a similar diversity of viruses if scientists looked more robustly.  But deforestation and urbanization, especially in densely populated places like China, are putting humans into closer contact with bats and other animals, which allows the spillover of viruses, Giotis said.  Did the Wuhan virus spill over from bats? Scientists in China have actively been studying bats carefully given that they've long been thought to have the potential to be the starting point of the next pandemic. In a paper published last year, scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology made an eerily prescient observation: ""It is generally believed that bat-borne CoVs (coronaviruses) will re-emerge to cause the next disease outbreak,"" they said. ""In this regard, China is a likely hotspot. The challenge is to predict when and where, so that we can try our best to prevent such outbreaks."" Daszak said that scientists have found about 50 SARS-related coronaviruses in bats all across China and the SARS coronavirus had been found in people in the southwestern province of Yunnan who lived near caves where the virus had been found in bats — although they showed no symptoms of respiratory illness during sampling.    ""These viruses are a really high risk for pandemic emergence. They're in bats, they're across Southeast Asia, people are exposed to them regularly, and they're actually getting infected,"" Daszak said. It's too early to say for sure whether the Wuhan coronavirus originated in bats and whether an intermediary played a role. The outbreak was initially traced to a seafood market that sold live animals in Wuhan and scientists are working hard to trace the source both in the lab and in the field.  Wu at the Chinese Center for Disease Control said the data was pointing toward the virus going from bats to another, unknown wild animal, and then to humans. She said no bats were sold or found at the seafood market and the outbreak was first reported in late December when most bat species in Wuhan are hibernating.  ""There are initial, although contested, reports that the virus has already been detected in both bats and snakes and the strains in both bats and snakes are similar to each other and to the strains from human cases,"" Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, told the Science Media Centre in London.  ""All the work around this new outbreak is new and ongoing which can explain why there are differing thoughts on what the source may be.""

2017-04-26 00:00:00,2017,4.0,26,Twitter earnings: Interview with Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems on the digital ad space,"But online advertising has yet to see a ""real breakthrough"" that allows any other players to really compete with Facebook and Google, said Scott McNealy, former chairman and CEO of Sun Microsystems. ""It's a pretty interesting, and tough and brutal game for anybody who's not Facebook and not Google,"" McNealy told CNBC's ""Squawk Box. "" ""They're owning so much of the digital advertising space. And the space hasn't really evolved as well, I think, as people wish it had. "" McNealy is now chairman and CEO Wayin, a digital marketing platform. When AT&T debuted the first online banner ad in 1994, it seemed promising, McNealy said. But he said that today, a minute fraction of netizens click on ads, and many of them do it accidentally. ""It's kind of a black box, and advertisers I talk to — the big brands — are very frustrated that they don't really know how many clicks they are getting,"" McNealy said. ""They're not getting the data back."" Twitter reported earnings of 11 cents per share on revenue of $548 million, better than the penny per share on revenue of about $512 million that was expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. Its premarket stock price was more than 9 percent higher. But overall, Twitter's earnings and revenue are on the decline from last year, and the company's outlook was bleaker than analyst forecasts, as the company is ""phasing out less effective ad formats."" ""You have the issues with the advertisers, where they don't trust the content on there,"" James Cakmak, internet equity research analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., told CNBC ahead of the earnings release. ""Fake users, the harassment issue. If you purge users, and make it completely verified, that would solve that problem. And secondly, you should be able to charge those users. "" Twitter has ambitions to stream live video programming all the time, according to BuzzFeed News. But so far, it has been losing steam to competitors. Snap, newly public, is growing super fast: Revenue was $404.48 million in 2016, up from $58.66 million in 2015. And Snapchat has high engagement, especially among teens. Amazon, meanwhile, has deepened its push into ""over-the-top"" video content, announcing this month an exclusive partnership to livestream ""Thursday Night Football. "" Last year, that deal belonged to Twitter. ""Targeting was supposed to be the holy grail, but all we're doing really is doing the same kind of advertising you see on TV: 20, 40, 60-second spots,"" McNealy said. ""That really hasn't changed the game."" Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg has made big acquisitions and expansive plans. Twitter, meanwhile, has seen a shake-up, with many top-level executives departing, leaving Anthony Noto as chief operating officer and chief financial officer. CEO Jack Dorsey is also at the helm of Square. Cakmak said Twitter's ad team may be too focused on winning TV advertising dollars. ""With a brand ad, it's all about trying to get to a mass market,"" Cakmak said. ""[Twitter's] ads and their team are mismatched with the skillset and the niche-ness of the model, which should be more direct response, highly tailored. "" McNealy said he's working with Twitter on ""brand experiences,"" using chat bots or artificial intelligence to take ads in different directions, depending on the viewer. ""Experiences are where you can actually interact — it's not, 'Lean back and watch a video,'"" McNealy said. ""Everybody who is watching advertising today has a keyboard, a touchscreen, a speaker and a microphone. So now you can engage."" — CNBC's Julia Boorstin contributed to this report",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/26/twitter-earnings-interview-with-scott-mcnealy-of-sun-microsystems-on-the-digital-ad-space.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,590
2020-01-14 00:00:00,2020,1.0,14,Travel app Omio the latest Berlin startup to take on North America,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Berlin-based online travel company Omio is launching operations in North America, joining other European mobility and fintech startups in seeking to scale up operations in the world’s top travel and tourism market. Omio, until its rebranding last year called GoEuro, competes with Britain’s Trainline in European rail travel, but also offers journey planning and ticketing for buses and flights via a smartphone app. Naren Shaam, Omio’s Indian-born, Harvard-educated founder and CEO, said the U.S. and Canadian markets were a logical next step after the acquisition in October of Rome2Rio, an Australian specialist in route discovery. “There are two fundamental pillars that drive us as a company. The first is global inventory for transport is not on a single product,” Shaam, 37, said in an interview at Omio’s headquarters in Berlin’s fashionable Prenzlauer Berg district. “The second pillar that drives us is that travel inherently is connected - and the products and the technology solutions today don’t offer a connected experience.” It is partnering initially with rail operators Amtrak, VIA Rail Canada; airlines Delta and United, and bus companies OurBus and Academy, with more expected to follow. Shaam moved to Berlin eight years ago to found the business and now has a following of 27 million monthly active users. Omio, like many start-ups, does not publish financial results. It has attracted $296 million in investor funding. The last round in October 2018 was led by Swedish investor Kinnevik, Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek [TEM.UL] and Asia-focused private equity fund Hillhouse Capital. Omio follows German travel app FlixMobility into North America but the two take different approaches. It is an aggregator whereas the Munich-based startup works with bus and train firms operating under its brand. Shaam said the value in the business is created by its ability to manage complexity in ground travel, which doesn’t have standardized procedures as in the airline sector. “It’s a full-service solution. It’s not just a meta search engine that is discovery based,” he said. In the first stage of its North American expansion, Omio will offer ticketing for more than 23,000 train and bus routes, as well as flights. It estimates the “addressable” market there at $138 billion for air travel, and $8 billion for ground. Shaam is counting on North American travelers, who make up 10% of Omio’s user base, becoming early adopters. And, he says, offering a choice of travel options along major corridors - such as the U.S. East Coast - makes good sense.

2020-01-22 00:00:00,2020,1.0,22,Factbox: Developments in online-only bank licensing in Asia,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Financial regulators across Asia are creating new rules for online-only banks as they seek to shake up often staid markets, helped by technology companies, which can operate at lower costs without needing physical branches. Below is snapshot of developments in the region. South Korea led the way with special rules for online-only banks in Asia, licensing K bank, led by the country’s largest telecom operator, KT Corp, in 2016, then Kakao Bank, operated by chat app operator Kakao Corp, in 2017. The Financial Services Commission has also issued a third preliminary digital licence to a consortium led by Toss, a mobile money transfer app provider, and which includes the local subsidiary of Britain’s Standard Chartered PLC (StanChart). Hong Kong issued eight online-only licences in 2018 from 33 applications. Licensees include Ant Financial [ANTFIN.UL] - an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - and consortia involving StanChart and Chinese social media and video game firm Tencent Holdings Ltd. ZA Bank, run by a unit of China’s ZhongAn Online P&C Insurance Co Ltd, has started trial operations, and up to four others are likely to follow suit early this year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said last week. In Taiwan, online-only licences were awarded in July 2019 to consortia led by Chunghwa Telecom Co Ltd, Japanese e-commerce firm Rakuten Inc and Japan-based chat app operator LINE Corp - the latter of which included Taipei Fubon Commercial Bank Co Ltd [FUBFNB.UL] and StanChart. The banks are set to start operations later this year. Singapore in January said it had received 21 applications for five online-only bank licences on offer. Bidders in various groups include Singapore Telecommunications Ltd, ride-hailing firm Grab Holdings Inc, Ant Financial and Hong Kong-listed gaming firm Razer Inc. The Monetary Authority of Singapore will issue up to two retail and three wholesale bank licences, with the winners - to be announced in June - starting operations from mid-2021. The central bank in Malaysia plans to issue up to five licences for either conventional or Islamic banking under a framework set to be finalised later this year. Grab, Razer, AirAsia, telecoms firm Axiata and lender CIMB are among companies looking to apply, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing sources. China is also working to finalise its first rules covering the online-only bank sector, Reuters reported last week, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter. The country already has four online-only banks including Tencent-backed WeBank and Alibaba offshoot MYbank, as well as AiBank, whose investors include search engine operator Baidu Inc and China Citic Bank Corp Ltd.

I truly pray to keep it that way.” And in the 10 years that followed, Steve-O has made that dream a reality. His sole foray into criminal behavior was a 30-day jail sentence in 2015 for protesting against SeaWorld, which he proudly accepted. “Considering I’ve become a clean and sober, dog-rescuing vegan, I must say I’m ready to go to jail — not just because it will bring so much attention to the plight of orcas in captivity, but because it’s nice to let people know I haven’t lost my edge. What can I say, I’m a jackass,” he wrote on Instagram at the time. “My whole crane-climbing, fireworks debacle really turned out to be pretty meaningful in the end, too. I mean, if your goal is to make a statement about captivity, you may as well get yourself locked up!” Steve-O is also now happily engaged to Lux Wright, after popping the question in January. “Last night, in front of a bunch of my Jackass buddies, my closest friends, my dad, and my sister… she said ‘yes,’ ” he wrote on Instagram. “I planned that for more than six months, and I’m so happy — I can’t wait for you all to see it… #GNARLY.”",https://people.com/health/jackass-steve-o-10-years-sobriety/,health,People,health,434
2016-09-21 00:00:00,2016,9.0,21,"Satellite tracking could prevent airliner disappearances, developers say","BERLIN (Reuters) - Two U.S. companies have developed an airline tracking system that they say would prevent planes disappearing in the manner of the Malaysia Airlines MH370. Instead of sending tracking signals to ground stations - which means planes’ locations can be lost over oceans or remote areas - the new system would beam them to satellites. “It doesn’t matter if they’re flying over the ocean, desert, or North Pole, we’ll know where the plane is,” said Daniel Baker, CEO of FlightAware, the internet flight tracking service which is working with Aireon LLC, which has developed the satellite technology. Aireon’s system will place ADS-B (automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast) receivers on low orbit satellites operated by Iridium Communications Inc and is due to be operational from 2018. The system was initially conceived to help air traffic controllers route planes more efficiently. The new tracking system, called GlobalBeacon, will make the location data from the space-based receivers available to airlines so they can track their planes in near real-time on a web-based tool. After the disappearance of MH370 in March 2014, regulators and airlines were criticized for responding too slowly to French tracking recommendations after the crash of an Air France plane in 2009. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) plans to impose a 15-minute standard for normal flight tracking, or more frequently in case of emergency, by November 2018. FlightAware said it would reveal the first airline customer for the product next week, to coincide with an ICAO meeting in Montreal. “We only reached out to a few of our dozens of airline customers to discuss this opportunity and although all are interested in using our space-based ADS-B data, only one could hit the tight timeline for our announcement,” Baker told Reuters.

2016-12-16 15:43:00,2016,12.0,16,The Real Journalists Behind Facebook’s Push to Stop Fake News,"Fake news has spread across Facebook this election season like a bad cold, and the social media giant is finally putting the kibosh on the ability to unwittingly share false articles. Facebook announced this week it will make it easier for users to flag stories as fake news, and those stories will be send to third-party fact-checkers for review. The company said it will be working specifically with organizations that have signed Poynter's International Fact-Checking Network's code of principles, which currently includes 43 organizations. Organizations such as Politifact, the Washington Post' Fact Checker, the Associated Press, Snopes and a host of fact-checking media outlets internationally will receive the flagged posts. If the posts do not meet their standards of accuracy—for example, if a claim has no sourcing, or if it is based on another organization's report that lacks sourcing—Facebook will mark it as ""fake"" and will display a warning message when someone tries to share it. ""We've focused our efforts on the worst of the worst,"" Facebook Vice President of Newsfeed Adam Mosseri said in a statement, ""on the clear hoaxes spread by spammers for their own gain, and on engaging both our community and third party organizations."" Some organizations in Poynter's International Fact-Checking Network, such as Politifact, exclusively publish reports related to the accuracy of statements made by politicians, important political figures and, recently, viral stories. Their Truth-O-Meter ranges from True to Pants on Fire, and their reporters write a detailed explanation of the ranking and their process in dissecting the statements. The key here is these organizations go into the work without specifically trying to disprove the statement. Their goal, instead, is to look at each part of the statement and evaluate whether the statement as a whole is truthful and an accurate representation of the situation described. Is there context missing? Is a complex problem being boiled down to a too-simple nugget? Or is someone flat-out lying? Fake news proliferated this year since some bloggers were able to get ad revenue from writing false and misleading articles that focused on sensational accusations. ""It's important to us that the stories you see on Facebook are authentic and meaningful. We're excited about this progress, but we know there's more to be done. We're going to keep working on this problem for as long as it takes to get it right,"" Mosseri said. While Facebook's measures still leave plenty of room for human error and bias, they've finally made one step toward tackling a rampant problem.

2020-01-07 00:00:00,2020,1.0,7,Amazon struggles to enforce its own rules for political ads,"As big tech companies are grappling with how to handle political ads on their platforms, Amazon is part of the club. The company's policies for how it handles sponsored ads, or ads that boost product or brand listings, remain unclear in terms of how they're being interpreted and enforced. On one hand, Amazon says it bans ads for products related to campaigns or to promote politicians. But the site still has many examples of sponsored products promoting candidates' 2020 campaigns or political parties. There's also at least one example of an advertiser whose sponsored ad was removed by Amazon because it contained a reference to a political figure, which Amazon claims was a mistake. Amazon's current policy for sponsored products states that ""Content related to campaigns, elections, or political issues of public debate; that advocates for or against a politician or a political party; or that personally attacks a political figure"" is prohibited. But in a few quick searches CNBC found dozens of examples of sponsored products that appeared to flout these rules, including a ""Michael Bloomberg 2020 President Supporter T-Shirt,"" a ""Talk Bernie to Me Sanders 2020"" T-shirt and one shirt reading ""Trump 2020 The Sequel Make Liberals Cry Again."" ""We require that all advertisers comply with Amazon Advertising policies,"" an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC in an emailed statement. ""We monitor ads for policy compliance using automated tools and review teams, and take action when those policies are not followed."" Big tech companies' treatment of political advertising has come under scrutiny in recent months. Spotify recently announced it was suspending political ads for 2020, citing insufficient tools to vet the ads. Twitter announced in October that it would ban political ads entirely. Facebook has taken the opposite approach, refusing to remove or fact-check ads from candidates even when they contain false information. Meanwhile, Snap has said it fact-checks political ads that appear on Snapchat. Steve Yates, CEO of Prime Guidance, consults some third-party sellers that offer political-themed merchandise on Amazon. He said he continues to see ""hundreds"" of ads for political merchandise on the platform, and they often appear as the top result in search queries. Among the sponsored items he's seen include Donald Trump and Joe Biden apparel, he said. It shows that Amazon isn't preventing sellers from using political figures or names ""as keywords to bid on,"" Yates added. ""However, they are expecting sellers to self-police themselves by not engaging ads on the site targeting those keywords,"" Yates said. Yates said he advises any sellers he works with to follow Amazon's policies, even though it's apparent that other sellers do not. When consumers search for a product on Amazon, they're likely to notice products with a ""sponsored"" label. These are ""sponsored products,"" or keyword-targeted ads that let advertisers promote certain products. To the untrained eye, it can be hard to tell they're ads at all. Here, advertisers bid on particular terms, and ads with higher bids are more likely to be displayed. Advertisers pay only when their ad is clicked, and they set the maximum amount they're willing to pay. This is similar to how search ads work on Google. These ads can appear above, near or within search results, or even on product detail pages. But even as many political ads have slipped through unnoticed by Amazon, Amazon said other sponsored politically themed products that follow Amazon's policies have been mistakenly removed. In late December, Amazon told one agency that advertises on behalf of the maker of novelty Trump apparel that it could not place ads for a product because they contained a reference to a political figure. The message came from an Amazon support email sent to the agency that was viewed by CNBC. (The agency asked CNBC not to identify the product because they don't have the rights to disclose their client's brand.) In the email, Amazon said that per its advertising guidelines, ""products with reference to any political figure and products that mock a person's appearance,"" are prohibited from advertising. The company said that ""as of now these products are only eligible to sell on Amazon, however, advertising them on Amazon is prohibited."" Amazon's email to the agency also said that ""similar ads"" may be found but to ""please know that these ads were approved prior to the change in the advertising guidelines and our internal team is reviewing these ads on the website and suspending such ads from advertisement. Since there are so many ads in our website, they are taking some time to remove all the ineligible ads from Advertising."" An Amazon spokeswoman said Monday, ""The email that CNBC viewed contains inaccurate information and our long standing policies have not changed."" The company said the product is actually permitted and that it was addressing the issue. But after the advertiser followed up later on Monday, Amazon sent them another email claiming the sponsored product was still in violation because the product was ""related to a political figure."" Will Tjernlund of Goat Consulting, an Amazon consulting agency who was working to place the ads on Amazon, said he understood why Amazon would be making a policy change, but said he wishes the company would do a better job of fully policing the policy. Amazon has had issues enforcing its ad policies in the past. In May 2019, the company told some small sellers it would no longer allow ads with religious content. Amazon later said that directive was a mistake, using identical language they used to comment on the politically related email this week, and said its employees would be retrained. But the sudden ad suspension in 2019 still took a direct hit on some sellers' sales. Both incidents are just the latest examples of Amazon's ongoing issues with the third-party marketplace, which now accounts for over half of the company's e-commerce volume. As the platform has grown to amass millions of sellers, it has become a hotbed for counterfeit, unsafe and expired goods, while the Amazon's Choice badge has also been called into question over reports it recommends fake, defective and inferior products. In response, legislators have written letters to CEO Jeff Bezos that call for the company to take steps to curb counterfeit goods and ask for more information about its product recommendation engine.",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/amazon-struggles-to-enforce-its-own-rules-for-political-ads.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,1044
2018-03-20 00:00:00,2018,3.0,20,"Streaming services: Americans spend $2.1 billion a month, in 55% homes","Media companies can keep worrying about cord cutting. Deloitte found in its 12th annual digital media trends survey that the percentage of American households that subscribe to a streaming service has grown to 55 percent. Last year, the firm reported that 49 percent of households reported at least one video subscription service. Kevin Westcott, vice chairman and U.S. media and entertainment leader at Deloitte, told CNBC that exclusive original content is a major driver for customers when they're choosing subscriptions. In its survey of 2,088 consumers, Deloitte said more than half of current streaming customers chose to subscribe to a service based on access to exclusive content. That's good news for streaming giant Netflix, which has seen its share price double in the past year even as it says it will continue to spend up to $8 billion on content in 2018. The company has long argued that this cash burn is a long-term investment because it ultimately owns the rights to the content created. Amazon has reportedly committed $5 billion a year to fund the growth of its content library. Traditional media companies are trying to keep up and market their own direct-to-consumer offerings. Disney recently reorganized its corporate structure, creating a new unit focused on its upcoming streaming services. That announcement came after the entertainment giant made a $66.1 billion deal, including debt, to acquire many parts of Twenty-First Century Fox. Disney's proposed acquisition of Fox assets would broaden the company's content portfolio, making it more competitive. CNBC previously reported fear of being outspent was one of the main reasons Rupert Murdoch decided to sell those Fox assets. But as the media companies run to the market with their new services, they may encounter a headwind. Deloitte reports that U.S. consumers are already flooded with choice. By its count, more than 200 streaming video-on-demand services are available on the market. The consulting firm said the average streaming customer has already subscribed to three services. U.S. consumers spend about $2.1 billion a month on these subscriptions, according to Deloitte. ""Once consumers' streaming subscriptions' costs approach their Pay TV bundle, there could be a slowdown in the SVOD growth,"" Westcott said. He said one way larger players may combat this is reaggregation, which could include making more services available per platform. But it's unlikely audiences would go back toward traditional bundles. Deloitte's survey found that 23 percent of those who don't currently have a subscription said they have never had one. Of those who do have a subscription, 46 percent of respondents said they were dissatisfied and 70 percent felt they were paying too much for the what they get out of the subscription.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/19/streaming-services-americans-spend-2-point-1-billion-a-month-in-55-percent-homes.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,444

2020-03-15 00:00:00,2020,3.0,15,Worries grow over northern hospitals as Italy's coronavirus toll grows,"MILAN, March 15 (Reuters) - Italian authorities voiced growing concern on Sunday over how much longer the strained health systems in northern regions worst hit by the coronavirus could cope with the relentless rise in new cases. While the virus has begun spreading rapidly across Europe, Italy remains the second most heavily affected country after China, where the virus first emerged. With more than 21,000 cases and 1,441 deaths by Saturday, its experience has offered an alarming example for other European countries which have begun seeing sharp rises in cases over recent days. Lombardy, the heavily populated area around the financial capital Milan, has been Italy’s worst-affected region with 966 deaths and 11,685 confirmed cases, more than half the national total. The health systems there and in other rich northern regions like Emilia Romagna and Veneto at the epicentre of the Italian outbreak are considered among the best in Europe, but have been pushed to their limits. “The numbers have continued to grow. We’re close to the moment where we will have no more intensive care beds,” Lombardy governor Attilio Fontana told SkyTG24 television. Most cases in Lombardy have been in small towns in areas like Bergamo and Brescia, but there have been fears of a major spread into Milan itself, which could overwhelm hospitals. “The big challenge will be to see how far we can succeed in keeping Milan, the metropolitan area, away from a mass phenomenon with the disease,” said Massimo Galli, head of the infectious diseases unit at Milan’s Sacco hospital. Authorities have been working to set up hundreds of intensive care beds in a specially created facility in the Fiera Milano exhibition centre but are still waiting for sufficient respirators and qualified personnel. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in a statement the government was working urgently on procuring more protective equipment, adding that there was maximum attention on Lombardy. “Our priority is to keep doctors, nurses and all our health personnel safe,” Conte said a week after his government imposed a virtual lockdown across the country. Italy was the first government in Europe to impose country-wide restrictions to try to control the spread of the virus, closing schools, shops and sporting events and ordering people to stay in their homes for all but essential travel. Behind the concern for the north, where intensive care and assisted breathing units were at saturation point, there was also a looming worry over the much less well-equipped south, where tens of thousands have arrived from the affected regions. Nello Musumeci, president of the Sicily region, said at least 31,000 people had arrived from northern and central areas hit by the virus in the past 10 to 12 days and registered with authorities but the real number was much higher. “How many other thousands have entered without showing the same sense of responsibility?” he told RAI state television, adding that the army might have to be deployed to oversee points of arrival. With the public health crisis also creating economic turmoil, Conte’s government is expected to confirm a 25 billion euro ($27.8 billion) package of measures to support businesses and workers affected by the shutdown.

2016-01-05 00:00:00,2016,1.0,5,Sony TVs will be able to buy and stream 4K movies from Sony Pictures,"4K TV sets have been at CES for years now, but the big question has remained: how are they going to get any content? Sony is starting to solve that problem with a new app called Ultra, which will run on its new HDR TVs. Ultra will allow you to buy and stream movies from Sony Pictures' catalog — there are supposed to be around 40 to 50 titles to start. Those include Chappie, Elysium, Fury, The Walk, Salt, Men in Black 3, Pineapple Express, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hancock, and After Earth. That's not the greatest starting lineup, to say the least, but it means that people buying Sony's new TVs will immediately have a way to take advantage of their new set's capabilities, rather than waiting on content to start streaming elsewhere. The app will launch later this year in the US. Though it's an Android TV app, it sounds like it may be limited to Sony TVs, at least to start. Alongside the announcement of Ultra, Sony announced a number of new TVs as well. You can read all about them over here. h2.ces-promo a{

2018-08-16 00:00:00,2018,8.0,16,How a vegan diet can change your body,"Veganism, the plant-based diet which shuns meat and dairy, is having its time in the sun. Since 2008, there has been a 350% increase in the number of self-described vegans in the UK alone. Where this motivation stems from is varied, but includes concerns about animal welfare, worries about the environment and religious reasons. Many people, though, seek a healthier diet. Research suggests that veganism can have health benefits, if well planned. For those who have pursued a diet rich in meat and dairy for most of their lives, embarking on a vegan diet can lead to significant changes within the body. The first few weeks The first thing that someone starting a vegan diet might notice is an energy boost with the removal of the processed meat that is found in many omnivorous diets, in favour of fruit, vegetables and nuts. These foods will boost your vitamin, mineral and fibre levels and thinking ahead about your meals and snacks rather than relying on convenience foods can help sustain consistent energy levels. As time without animal products grows into weeks, there is likely to be a shift in bowel function either towards a more regular, healthy pattern or an increase in bloating, wind and loose motions. This is due to the higher fibre content of a vegan diet and the simultaneous increase in carbohydrates that ferment in the gut and can cause irritable bowel syndrome. How does your body burn fat? This may settle eventually and could lead to some positive changes in the diversity of the bacteria in the colon, depending on whether a vegan diet is made up of processed food and refined carbohydrates or is well planned and balanced. Although not proven yet, scientists believe that a high species diversity for gut bacteria could be beneficial for the whole system, in the same way that ecosystems are stronger as a result of lots of different types of species thriving. Three to six months later Several months into a vegan diet and some people may find that the increase in fruit and vegetables and reduced processed food can help acne to clear up. By this point however, your stores of vitamin D might be dropping as key sources of it in our diet come from meat, fish and dairy, and it isn't always noticeable until it's too late. Vitamin D isn't well understood but it's essential in keeping bones, teeth and muscles healthy and deficiency has been linked with cancer, heart disease, migraines and depression. This is because vitamin D stores are only thought to last about two months in the body. How long your stores last will depend on the time of year that you decide to go vegan because the body can make vitamin D from sunlight. Making sure you eat plenty of fortified foods or take a supplement is important, especially in the winter months. Three research-based weight loss strategies Within a few months, a well-balanced vegan diet which is low in salt and processed food may have impressive benefits for cardiovascular health, helping to prevent heart disease, stroke and reducing the risk of diabetes. As the intake of nutrients like iron, zinc and calcium are reduced on a vegan diet, our bodies get better at absorbing them from the intestine. The adaptation may be enough to prevent deficiencies in some people but not for everyone, in which case supplements can fill the shortfall. From six months to several years on Approaching a year on a vegan diet, vitamin B12 stores may become depleted. Vitamin B12 is a nutrient that is essential to the healthy functioning of blood and nerve cells and can only be found in animal products. Symptoms of B12 deficiency include breathlessness, exhaustion, poor memory and tingling in the hands and feet. B12 deficiency is easily prevented by eating three portions of fortified food per day or taking a supplement, but managing it is very important, as any deficiency would negate the benefits of a vegan diet for heart disease and stroke risk and can cause permanent nerve and brain damage. A few years down the line and even our bones will start to notice the change. Our skeleton is a mineral store and up until the age of 30 we can add minerals to it from our diet, but after that, our bones can't absorb minerals anymore and so getting enough calcium when we're young is vital. I go to the gym every day; why can't I lose weight? After the age of 30, our bodies harvest the calcium from our skeleton for use in the body, and if we don't replenish the calcium in our blood through our diet, our bones fill the deficit and become brittle as a result. Vegetables rich in calcium like kale and broccoli may protect bones, but many vegans don't meet their calcium requirements and there is a 30% increased risk of fracture among vegans when compared to vegetarians and omnivores. Plant-based calcium is also harder to absorb and therefore supplements or plenty of fortified foods is recommended. When contemplating the years ahead on a vegan diet, balance is key. Well-balanced vegan diets may have major health benefits. Many of those benefits can be offset by deficiencies if the diet isn't managed carefully, but supermarkets and food outlets are making it easier than ever to enjoy a varied and exciting vegan diet and our appetite for meat overall is declining. With the right preparation, a vegan diet can be good for human health. Sophie Medlin is a lecturer in nutrition and dietetics at King's College London. Copyright 2018 The Conversation.

2016-05-27 00:00:00,2016,5.0,27,India's Tata Group enters ecommerce market with apparel and electronics website,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s biggest conglomerate Tata Group launched an ecommerce venture on Friday, as it seeks to cash in on rising purchasing power in a market dominated by deep-pocketed international retailers and startups backed by global tech investors. The group said it developed its Tata Cliq website over a year and a half at a cost of “several hundred million dollars” to be a marketplace for inhouse and partner companies to sell apparel and electronics. The move is in line with a second phase in Indian ecommerce development, with the some of the country’s oldest and largest corporations entering an industry established in the last five years by startups Snapdeal and Flipkart Online Services Pvt Ltd [IPO-FLPK.N]. The market also welcomed global ecommerce firm Amazon.com, Inc in 2013, which has invested over $2 billion for growth. Local conglomerates only lately entered the fray. Reliance Industries Ltd started an online apparel shop last month, while Aditya Birla Group and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd recently launched online retail platforms. For big business houses, ecommerce is an opportunity to capitalize on middle class growth and rapid internet adoption. By 2025, online merchandise sales will hit $220 billion in India from $11 billion last year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimated. But the market has fostered cut-price competition, with the top three players incurring millions of dollars in losses due to heavy discounts. Tata said its focus was profit margins and unit economics, and not just growing sales via discounts. “We don’t want to get into the discount wars, we want to serve customers with great products and build a sustainable business,” said Chief Executive Ashutosh Pandey of Tata Unistore, parent of the operator of Tata Cliq. To keep costs in check, Pandey said Tata would not use its money to establish a large number of warehouses like other ecommerce players have done, and would instead build inventory networks around existing store locations owned by group partners. The group, whose businesses include steel production, tea packaging, information technology services and automobiles, has bet on new businesses in recent years with mixed success. Its retail businesses including sellers of gold ornaments, sunglasses, apparel and electronics have successfully expanded, but its mobile phone venture Tata Docomo is a marginal player.

2019-07-18 14:28:54,2019,7.0,18,"Microsoft Earnings: Sales Jump 12 Percent, Fueled by Cloud","SEATTLE — If you followed Congress’s scrutiny of the technology industry this week, you would think that Amazon, Google and Facebook are the biggest tech companies around. But Microsoft is the sector’s quiet giant. It is not only the largest tech company, but it is the largest publicly traded company of any kind, with a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion. The success continued in the most recent quarter, Microsoft said Thursday. The company reported that its sales grew 12 percent, to $33.7 billion, and it had $13.2 billion in profits during that period, aided by $2.6 billion in one-time tax benefits. The results beat analyst forecasts, which predicted the company would have $32.8 billion in sales and $9.4 billion in profit, according to FactSet. The strong results indicate Microsoft is not seeing large companies shy away from investing in new technology out of concern for a downturn or trade war. Shares in the company rose more than 2 percent in aftermarket trading. “The biggest debate is at $1 trillion, how can you get bigger from here?” said Jennifer Lowe, an analyst at the investment bank UBS. At its core, Microsoft’s primary customers are other businesses and organizations, and the company is betting its future that they will keep moving their tech needs into the cloud. Most investors keep a close eye on how quickly Microsoft’s core cloud-computing product, Azure, has grown. In the most recent quarter, Azure grew 68 percent compared with the previous year, maintaining a rapid pace of expansion even as the business gets bigger. Ms. Lowe, who estimated Azure brought in roughly $13 billion in annual sales, said, “That pace of growth, at that scale, is pretty unprecedented.” (By comparison, Amazon’s cloud business had about $28 billion in sales in the past four quarters, up 46 percent.) This quarter, for the first time, Intelligent Cloud, the part of Microsoft’s business that includes Azure, became the company’s largest revenue generator. “It has been a long time coming,” said Mike Spencer, who runs investor relations for Microsoft. Amazon, the cloud-computing leader, is the provider of choice for digitally native companies like Netflix, but Microsoft has found traction with traditional large corporations and organizations, Ms. Lowe said. Microsoft has been pushing the adoption of cloud service beyond the simple storing of information in remote data centers. It has persuaded corporate customers to employ cloud computing to transform how they do business using tools like artificial intelligence, and to connect workers on retail sales floors and assembly lines to corporate technology. In traditional setups, when companies ran their own servers, it was hard to upgrade and add new functions. “Every time you wanted to do something new, you had to buy new hardware,” said Sid Parakh, a portfolio manager in Seattle at Becker Capital, which invests in Microsoft. “With cloud, you have as many capabilities as you want overnight.” One Microsoft metric — known by the long, wonky name of server products and cloud services revenue growth — provides clues about whether that approach is taking hold. It lumps together sales for traditional data centers and cloud services, and this quarter it was up 24 percent over the previous year. That it is growing at such a solid clip suggests the cloud business is not just taking old revenue and moving it online. Last week, Microsoft announced a deal with the Providence St. Joseph Health system that is geared toward collecting health data from different sources in one place, using artificial intelligence to improve results for patients and connecting more than 100,000 caregivers to one another. This week, it announced a deal with AT&T, which Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, told analysts was “the largest commercial deal that we have signed.” That wonky metric is also a sign of what is known as a hybrid approach to cloud computing, where big organizations keep some information on their own servers and some in the cloud, using a single set of tools to work on it all. Such an approach eases companies’ transition to the cloud, and is a particular strength for Microsoft. Microsoft still sells Windows and Office software to consumers, and some of its Surface tablet and laptop sales also target individual customers. But the most interesting part of its consumer business is gaming. The past fiscal year has been odd for Microsoft’s gaming business, in part because it is overdue for a new Xbox gaming console (the company recently announced that one would be out for the 2020 holiday season). In the long term, Microsoft is working to become a hub for players to stream games live from the cloud. It went so far as to enter a partnership with Sony, which makes a competing console, under which the companies will work on online entertainment together. A year ago, Microsoft’s gaming business did particularly well on the success of Fortnite. The company cautioned investors that this past quarter, gaming might not be as strong. Indeed, the company reported that gaming revenue declined 8 percent. Executives expressed optimism for the coming fiscal year, saying the company once again expects double-digit growth in sales. Its projections for next quarter’s revenue were slightly higher than analysts had expected. Mr. Nadella said the company had been forging “deeper partnerships and larger, longer commitments” with customers as they transform their business, and that path will continue. An earlier version of this article misstated the video game that helped Microsoft’s business last year. It was Fortnite, not Minecraft.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/technology/microsoft-earnings-report.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,914

2016-09-08 00:00:00,2016,9.0,8,Samsung seeks court order to remove goods from Hanjin vessels,"(Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd on Thursday asked a U.S. judge to allow the South Korean company to pay cargo handlers to remove its goods from Hanjin Shipping Co Ltd’s vessels stationed near U.S. ports after the world’s seventh-largest container carrier filed for bankruptcy. Hanjin’s collapse last week came during the peak shipping period ahead of the year-end holiday season, stranding cargo for the likes of HP Inc and Samsung. Around $14 billion of cargo has been tied up globally as ports, tug boat operators and cargo handling firms refuse to work for Hanjin because they fear they will not be paid due to uncertainty over plans to provide new financing. Samsung said an order this week by a U.S. bankruptcy judge did not encourage the Hanjin ships to enter U.S. ports as intended, which the company blamed on a misunderstanding of maritime law, the bankruptcy code and Korean law. The maker of electronic goods including Galaxy smartphones said the judge should issue an order barring the seizure of ships and allow it and other cargo owners to retrieve their goods by paying cargo handlers, who have been demanding payment guarantees. “There’s no earthly reason why these parties should not be permitted to cut their own deals,” Samsung said in a Thursday court filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Newark, New Jersey. Cargo handler Maher Terminals LLC, which operates a container terminal in the Port of New York and New Jersey, backed the plan to let owners of cargo pay for handling. But it urged the court in a filing not to protect Hanjin vessels from seizure without also considering the rights of suppliers. “Maher is currently being victimized by having hundreds of Hanjin containers clogging up its facility and impeding the ability of Maher to properly service its other customers,” the company said in court papers on Thursday. Nothing in the court order “should be deemed to compel parties like Maher to continue to provide services without receiving payment or adequate assurance of such payment,” it added. Total Terminals International LLC, a West Coast marine terminal operator partly owned by Hanjin, earlier in the week cautioned the court that a plan was needed to pay for several levels of port services, such as tug boats and stevedores, and to ensure Hanjin vessels would be able to refuel and leave port. “This lack of a short term plan for these vessels will lead to mayhem,” it said in the filing. An attorney for Hanjin, Ilana Volkov, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. One Hanjin ship, the Hanjin Scarlet, is in Canada’s Port of Prince Rupert, where it is being unloaded, with cargo owners covering charges, port spokesman Kris Schumacher said. It remains unclear if the vessel would proceed to stops in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Seattle, he added. “... All the supply chain partners - the pilots, the tug boat operators, the marine terminals operators, railroads and trucking companies - are saying they want a guarantee they will be paid,” said Tara Mattina, a spokeswoman for The Northwest Seaport Alliance, a partnership between the ports of Seattle and Tacoma, Washington, that manages their cargo terminal leases. The U.S. judge, John Sherwood, will hear the request on Friday. As of Thursday afternoon, two Hanjin ships were near the Port of Long Beach, according to the Marine Exchange of Southern California, which tracks cargo ship traffic. One of the ships, the Hanjin Boston, is scheduled to head into the port on Friday afternoon for re-fueling. A third ship, the Hanjin Greece, was off the shore of Mexico, where it could avoid U.S. anti-pollution regulations that require use of low-sulfur fuel, the tracking group said. Many ships carry only a limited supply of low-sulfur fuel. Some cargo owners have already paid fees to terminal operators to allow the release of Hanjin containers held up on the docks, according to a Port of Oakland spokesman. The Seoul Central District Court is presiding over the receivership filed by Hanjin last week. A foreign representative of the shipping line has filed for so-called Chapter 15 bankruptcy with the Newark court. Chapter 15 is meant to allow a company to seek recognition by U.S. courts of orders issued overseas and to ask U.S. judges to assist in a foreign corporate debt restructuring.

2016-03-22 00:00:00,2016,3.0,22,Knowledge of genetic risk doesn't prompt behavior changes,"Reuters Health - Telling patients about their genetic risk for disease doesn’t usually lead to healthy behavior changes like eating better or exercising more, according to a new analysis of existing studies. Researchers selected 18 studies that tracked seven potential behavior changes - like quitting smoking, diet, physical activity, and using sun protection - among people who had received genetic risk information for conditions including lung cancer, Crohn’s disease, melanoma, colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. In general, telling patients about their DNA-based risk estimates for these conditions did not affect their health behaviors or motivation to change behavior and did not lead to negative effects like depression or anxiety, the researchers reported in BMJ. Most of the evidence was low-quality, however, the authors note. Genetic tests have several possible uses but this review suggests that such tests have no role in policies aimed at changing behavior to improve population health, said senior author Theresa M. Marteau of the Behavior and Health Research Unit at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. “Two other possible uses include providing people with information to reduce uncertainty they may have about their chances of developing a disease even if the risk cannot be averted,” as in the case of the severe neurological disorder Huntington’s disease, and in categorizing people by risk to see who could benefit from interventions like surgery or medication, she said by email. “Information is at best a weak intervention for changing behavior,” Marteau said. “We just have to reflect on the failure of most of us to keep our New Year resolutions . . . to realize that there is too often a gap or rather a chasm between our intentions and our behavior.” Physical and economic cues, like serving food with smaller tableware, may be a more effective way to prompt healthy behavior change, she said. Genetic risk information may play a role in behavior change, but not on its own, said U.S. National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins, who was not part of the new review. “Inducing behavior change for diet and exercise and is extremely difficult, and these subjects were not offered any support,” Collins told Reuters Health by phone. “Even if they thought they should do something about it there was no assistance.” Linking genetic risk assessments with interventional support systems and resources like wearable fitness trackers, as is happening now in the federal government’s Precision Medicine Initiative, may have better results, he said.

2016-05-24 17:40:00,2016,5.0,24,This Powerpuff Girls PSA Is Teaching Brazilian Kids About Zika,"When it comes to fighting Zika, the World Health Organization is taking all the help it can get, including enlisting the help of cartoon-loving kids. Zika, a mosquito-spread virus linked to birth defects, has now reached 60 countries worldwide and has largely affected Latin American countries. To help efforts to reduce the number of mosquitoes that spread the virus, the WHO's Pan American Health Organization is rolling out a public service announcement campaign aimed at kids, featuring cartoon characters like the Powerpuff Girls: The ads, which are currently running on the Cartoon Network's Latin America channels, encourage kids to dump out pools of standing water to eliminate breeding grounds for mosquitoes and also give tips for avoiding mosquito bites, such as wearing long sleeves. The emphasis on the importance of reducing the number of mosquitoes is particularly poignant after the WHO's director Dr. Margaret Chan criticized countries Monday for lackluster mosquito control. Massive eradication efforts helped significantly drop mosquito numbers in many Latin American countries in the 1960s, including Brazil, which has been hardest hit so far by the virus. But over time, those efforts were abandoned and the population reemerged. Chan called Zika ""the price being paid for a massive policy failure that dropped the ball on mosquito control in the 1970s"". Now that the mosquito population has become a specific threat, there's a renewed urgency to fight back and a desperation to do it quickly. If that means calling on little kids to pitch in, that's probably not the worst idea.

2018-07-27 00:00:00,2018,7.0,27,AstraZeneca's key lung cancer drug wins European panel thumbs-up,"(Reuters) - AstraZeneca’s cancer drug Imfinzi has won a key recommendation from a European Medicines Agency (EMA) panel less than six months after the first global approvals in Western markets. EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended Imfinzi, an immunotherapy drug already boosting sales for the British drugmaker, for use in lung cancer patients with inoperable disease that had advanced locally but not spread widely around the body. While final approvals are up to the European Commission, it generally follows the CHMP’s recommendation and endorses them within a couple of months. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February granted approval for expanded use of Imfinzi to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with inoperable mid-stage disease that has not spread widely around the body. Japan also approved the drug earlier this month. The latest green light - which had been expected after positive clinical data last year - gives AstraZeneca a chance to intervene earlier in lung cancer, distinguishing it from rivals that have approval for tackling advanced or metastatic disease. Globally, about 30 percent of patients with NSCLC present with stage III disease. These individuals typically receive a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but only around 15 percent of them are still alive after five years. Imfinzi, chemically known as durvalumab, belongs to a new class of immuno-oncology drugs that block a mechanism tumors use to evade detection from the immune system. AstraZeneca’s drug already had approval for treating certain patients with bladder cancer. However, this market is relatively small. The really big opportunity for all companies seeking to exploit the power of modern immuno-oncology drugs is lung cancer, since it is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche and Merck all have approved products for treating certain patients with advanced lung cancer - but AstraZeneca is now in a position to carve out a niche in treating earlier stage III patients.

2019-09-19 00:00:00,2019,9.0,19,"How to kick-start your brain in the morning (and no, we don't just mean coffee)"," (CNN)The alarm goes off and you shudder awake, unsure of where you are. Groggily you recognize your room and slowly roll out of bed thinking, ""It can't be morning. Didn't I just go to bed?"" Called sleep inertia, it happens when you suddenly snap out of REM sleep -- a deeper stage of sleep where you dream and your body repairs itself. During that sleep cycle your body is flooded with high levels of melatonin, the body's sleep hormone. Waking with a body packed full of a sleep aid causes disorientation and shaky sensory-motor performance that typically lasts about 30 minutes to an hour. But if you're sleep deprived (and who isn't these days?), the grogginess can remain for two or more hours. Sleep inertia can also happen when waking from a daytime snooze that went long, well past the 20 minute power nap that might refresh you. The effects of sleep inertia can be disastrous. If you spill your morning coffee or stub your toe on the furniture, consider yourself lucky. After taking an in-flight nap, an Air India Express pilot overshot the landing runway and crashed a plane full of 166 people into a hillside, where it rolled and burst into flames. Only eight survived. What to do? Now that you're woke, so to speak, to the dangers of a sleep-slogged brain, let's see what science tells us we can do about it. Consider cold water Can chilly water shock you awake? A small study showed people who splashed their face after a nap did as well on a memory search task as people who did not nap. But whether it improves your performance enough to, say, drive a car or impress your boss, has yet to be studied.  If you're rolling out of bed groggy, however, it makes sense that a cooler shower might be just the jolt your body needs to clear some cobwebs.  Caffeinate, but carefully Drinking a couple of cups of coffee or caffeinated tea is a proven way to jump-start attention. That's because caffeine increases neuron firing in the brain, which also triggers the release of adrenaline that causes your heart to beat faster.  No need to gulp down more than two cups at one sitting, as studies show more doesn't add additional mental clarity, and can make you jittery.  Bask in the light A sunshiny day can lift your spirits and energize your mind. One study exposed subjects to bright lights after wakening and found it increased cortisol levels. Cortisol is a steroid hormone, sort of an internal alarm system. To respond to stress, cortisol increases glucose in your bloodstream, and enhances your brain's use of those sugars.  Another study exposed subjects to a bright white light when they woke up and found alertness improved dramatically. Take a brisk walk Take a brisk walk around your home, or better yet, go for a walk outside in the sunlight. Studies show exercise temporarily boosts alertness, in part because of the accompanying rise in body temperature and the boost of blood to the brain. Try a combo One study found that a mix of caffeine, bright light and face washing with cold water helped jump-start alertness after a short nap.  Turn to protein Even if you crave it, sugar is no solution for breakfast or a wake-up snack after a nap. It will only give you a short high, and the crash that follows can be brutal, says sleep specialist and clinical psychologist Michael Breus. Instead, rely on proteins such as eggs to boost brain power.  Prevent the problem Of course the best way to tackle sleep inertia is to prevent it in the first place.  ""Probably the easiest way is to have a consistent wake up time, based on the number of sleep cycles you want,"" says Breus, author of ""Beauty Sleep."" Most people need five sleep cycles which average 90 minutes each, Breus says, which comes to about 7 ½ hours each night. To figure out the time to go to bed, Breus suggests counting back from your wake up time by 7 ½ hours. ""So if you wake at 6:30 a.m., go to bed at 11 p.m.,"" Breus says. ""Do this for one week. If you start to wake just before the alarm, then you're in great shape. If not, adjust your bedtime backwards until you do. Bye bye, sleep inertia.""

2020-03-02 00:00:00,2020,3.0,2,"Spring cleaning and the potential mind-altering, life-extending benefits of it"," (CNN)""I'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair,"" sings Nellie, the female lead in the 1958 film version of the classic musical ""South Pacific,"" as she showers her hair squeaky clean. Today, Lizzo has updated the theme with ""Shampoo, press, get you out of my hair.""  There's a theme here, and it applies to more than just shedding a bad relationship. ""Spring cleaning"" your mind, body, even your home can be liberating -- a ""fresh"" start, so to speak. Science agrees. There's something about a deep clean and purge of dust, dirt and clutter that inspires a sense of rebirth, which must be why we traditionally tackle our clutter in the spring, as new buds bloom and newborn creatures scurry. And by starting anew in less cluttered space, we reduce our stress, improve our moods, and get more energy -- which in turn could give us the boost we need to eat healthy, exercise and get more sleep -- which in turn, could lengthen our lives. Do you 'KonMari'? Marie Kondo popularized the benefits of simplifying and organizing your home with her best-selling book, ""The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up."" Her method, which she calls ""KonMari,"" suggests tackling your clutter by asking each item: ""Do you bring joy to my life?"" If the answer isn't ""yes,"" it's time to toss. By clearing space we do more than just save time and money, according to professional organizer Regina Leeds, author of the 2008 New York Times bestseller, ""One Year to an Organized Life."" ""We create in the physical world the pattern of how we think and experience the world,"" Leeds said. Or, put more succinctly, ""Your crap and your clutter is what's going on inside of you."" Boosts self-esteem Clearing out ""our crap"" raises our self-esteem and shifts energy, Leeds explained. We open ourselves up to change and are in a better position to reach our potential. Leeds knows as well as anyone the power of decluttering. She was seeing transformed clients decades before Americans began drinking the Kondo Kool-Aid and buzzing about ""Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"" the Japanese organizing consultant's Netflix series. Organizing was Leeds' ""side hustle"" starting in January 1988, what she did to get by while hoping to become a full-time actress. People at Los Angeles parties raised their eyebrows or looked confused when Leeds told them what she was doing. Today Leeds, who spent a year roaming LA with a feng shui master and views organizing as a spiritual activity, is known as the ""Zen Organizer."" Her company slogan: ""Inner peace through outer order."" Endorsed by psychologists One doesn't have to be a professional organizer, or be schooled in feng shui, to understand the value of decluttering. There's a psychological upside, according to PhDs. Michael Tompkins is a licensed psychologist and co-director of the San Francisco Bay Area Center for Cognitive Therapy. He's written two books on hoarding and, fun fact, has even appeared in several episodes of the show ""Hoarders."" And while hoarding is a whole different level of stuff, not to mention a disorder diagnosed as a mental illness, Tompkins can speak to why tidying up makes people feel so good. We live in ""an acquiring culture,"" Tompkins said, ""and perhaps there are some of us, myself included, that long for the serenity that can come with less stuff."" Our moods can be boosted by ""pleasant activities and mastery activities,"" he explained. Hanging out with friends, spending a day on the beach, watching a comedy: These are ""pleasant activities"" that naturally lift us up.  The ""mastery activities"" Tompkins referred to, on the other hand, are tasks we take on that may not be as fun in the moment but elevate us with an enormous sense of accomplishment once we're done. It's what Ellen Delap, a certified professional organizer (there's a board for that), sees time and again. People she's helped are left with a new sense of hope. ""Right away, people see change in their environment,"" said Delap, of Houston, Texas, the current president of the nearly 3,500-member National Association of Productivity and Organizing Professionals. ""They feel their space is lighter."" The clutter continuum The tolerance for clutter varies from person to person, said Tompkins. A pile that makes one person's skin crawl can be completely overlooked by another. There's also a continuum when it comes to our propensity for acquiring and holding onto stuff, said Craig Sawchuk, a Mayo Clinic psychologist and co-chair of the Division of Integrated Behavioral Health. Putting people like Kondo aside, on one end, you have people who try to get rid of things with some regularity, during, say, spring cleaning. Next, Sawchuk said, you've got the collectors who accumulate a growing amount of certain items: clothes, mugs, snow globes from around the world. The pack rat might fill a storage space or overwhelm an attic. And the hoarder, on the extreme far end, sits in a functionally impaired and often unsafe living space. Most all of us, no matter where we are on the continuum, ""have good intentions but don't know where to start,"" he said. The ""flittering effect"" might send us from room to room, taking on one mess only to dart off to try another -- so we don't see tangible results. The ""bumping phenomenon"" let's us push that decluttering off for another day, week, month or, gulp, year. That's why experts like Leeds, Delap, Kondo can be so helpful. They offer us roadmaps, Sawchuk said, strategies to inform problem solving and decision making -- what to keep, toss or donate -- as we face our clutter. They offer an approach ""to help simplify your life and reduce that kind of visual distress,"" he said. ""Once you get into the groove of decision making, it starts to feel good. ... All those reasons to retain things, those retention beliefs, they start to weaken and fade."" We become more relaxed because our environment is clearer, he said. We process information differently because visually there's ""less noise to your brain."" And when we recycle items by donating them to people who need and will use them, that sort of altruism ""psychologically can have a really, really good impact on us."" Being our best selves To do right by yourself, don't set out to be perfect, experts say. You are not Marie Kondo and, newsflash, you never will be. Don't be too critical of yourself and, when taking on decluttering, don't surround yourself with anyone who will shame you or -- equally bad -- reprimand you for not keeping certain items. Create the right decluttering environment by surrounding yourself with good lighting, fun music, healthy snacks, plenty of water, a supportive friend or family member. Take breaks and allow yourself a stopping point, said Leeds, who can tell when clients are done because their eyes start to glaze over. Organizing is a skill, one we have to learn how to do correctly, she said. Furthermore, it's something that needs to be maintained. ""You don't go to the dentist, find out you don't have cavities, and say, 'Thank God I don't have to go to the dentist again,' "" or floss and brush anymore, Leeds said. By opening ourselves up to a decluttered life, we can be our best selves, the Zen Organizer said. ""We can calm the inside by bringing order to the outer,"" Leeds said. ""The average person lives in an environment that sabotages his or her best efforts at every turn,"" she continued. ""You can accomplish more, quicker and with ease, if your environment literally nurtures and supports you.""

""We are cancelling Daily Stormer's registration with Google Domains for violating our terms of service,"" the company representative said in a statement. Earlier Monday, The Daily Stormer moved its domain registration to Google after hosting firm GoDaddy said it would sever ties with the site that promoted Saturday's deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. At that time, a ""whois"" search of Internet domains on Monday listed Alphabet's Google as registrar for The Daily Stormer, a white supremacist website associated with the alt-right movement. The Google domain registration site says that customers can transfer domains to the Internet giant through an automated, online process that can take 20 minutes. GoDaddy disclosed on Sunday via Twitter that it had given The Daily Stormer 24 hours to move its domain to another provider, saying it had violated the company's terms of service. "" GoDaddy has previously come under sharp criticism for hosting The Daily Stormer and other sites that spread hate. The company decided to boot the on Sunday out of fear that it could be used to incite further violence after the events in Charlottesville, including the death of Heather Heyer, who was fatally struck by a car allegedly driven by a man with white nationalist views.

2018-10-15 00:00:00,2018,10.0,15,Dell unveils the first 49-inch ultra-wide monitor with QHD resolution,"The Dell UltraSharp U4919DW is the first QHD 49-inch ultra-wide monitor on the market, and it has me more excited about monitors than I’ve been in a while. Other ultra-wide displays with a 32:9 screen ratio only have a 1080p vertical resolution. The result is a wide, but short user interface. But in Dell’s case, the solution is more pixels and a better viewing angle. Here’s what is so different about the U4919DW compared to other 32:9 ultra-wide monitors: it’s a dual QHD monitor with a resolution of 5120 x 1440 pixels. Besides that enormous display resolution, you’ll be immersed by whatever is on-screen, thanks to the 3800R curvature with 109 pixels-per-inch and 100 percent sRGB support for accurate colors. Like any other ultra-wide monitor, there’s HDMI / DisplayPort / USB-C support, but here’s the kicker: you also have KVM (keyboard, video, and mouse) functionality. Using the U4919DW’s KVM, you can connect one machine via USB-C, plus a second over HDMI / DisplayPort with a USB upstream and use keyboard shortcuts via Dell’s Display Manager app to control both systems with one set of peripherals. It’s a pretty snazzy feature, especially for the clientele for this monitor — specifically those in finance, graphic design, or data analysis sectors. Dell says the UltraSharp U4919DW will cost $1,699 on October 26th, which is a high price to pay for any monitor. But if you’re in the market for a 4K screen, it’s definitely not as expensive as Acer’s much smaller 27-inch 4K monitor.

2016-09-05 00:00:00,2016,9.0,5,Singapore says will no longer isolate Zika patients,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore will no longer isolate people who test positive for Zika or are suspected of carrying it as the number of cases of the mosquito-borne virus increases across the city-state, the health ministry said on Monday. Tropical Singapore, a global financial and transit hub, has reported just over 240 Zika cases since the first locally infected case was detected on Aug. 27, and media has quoted the deputy health minister as saying the virus was “here to stay”. In a statement, the health ministry said the presence of the Aedes mosquitoes that carry the virus, as well as the fact that most people do not display symptoms, meant isolating patients already infected would have limited effect. “Over time, we expect Zika cases to emerge in more areas given the presence of the Aedes mosquitoes here,” the ministry said. “As the cases of Zika in Singapore have been mild so far, confirmed cases will no longer need to be hospitalized unless medically indicated.” The government will also pay for the cost of Zika tests for Singaporeans with symptoms of the virus, the ministry added. Most people who are infected with Zika have mild symptoms but infections in pregnant women have been shown to cause microcephaly - a severe birth defect in which the head and brain are undersized - as well as other brain abnormalities. The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last fall in Brazil, which has since confirmed more than 1,800 cases of microcephaly. In adults, Zika infections have also been linked to a rare neurological syndrome known as Guillain-Barre, as well as other neurological disorders. Neighboring Malaysia has reported at least one case of locally transmitted Zika. Experts and officials say both countries will struggle to contain the virus because of the spread of the Aedes mosquitoes, which also carry dengue, a potentially fatal virus that Singapore and Malaysia have been battling for years.

2017-08-31 16:00:00,2017,8.0,31,The Most Realistic Antarctic Warming Experiment to Date Went Worse Than Expected ," When it comes to climate change, we're often debating the impact of just one or two degrees of warming. But when it comes to ocean temperatures, we don't have a ton of in situ research that shows the consequences of an ever-so-slightly more tepid sea. Now, thanks to a new study published Thursday in Current Biology, we know that when Antarctic Ocean waters warm just one or two degrees Celsius, it completely changes the ecosystem in a way even the study's authors did not anticipate. ""We knew there would be changes, but it was the extent of the change that surprised us,"" said Gail Ashton, the lead author of the study and a researcher with the British Antarctic Survey and the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, in a phone interview. ""We expected maybe a 10 percent growth rate [of certain organisms]. We saw a 100 percent growth rate."" Previous experiments have tried to set up laboratory condition identical to the Antarctic Ocean to test out how warming temperatures influence sea flora and fauna. But Ashton and her team, which studies ocean microorganisms, wanted to see what happens when you warm the actual Antarctic Ocean on site. To do this, they placed small plastic blocks rigged with heating elements on the shallow Antarctic seabed. Using these blocks, they could reliably control the temperature of the surface (where these microorganisms colonize) and about 3 millimeters of water above and around the blocks, Ashton said. Some were heating 1 degree Celsius above the surrounding water temperatures, some 2 degrees, and other weren't heated at all, to provide a control group. They found that with even just 1 degree of warming many species doubled in population over the nine-month experiment. One species in particular, a sort of sea lichen called Fenestrulina rugula, basically took over, crowding out other species and reducing the biodiversity, with other species declining (but none disappearing). Other species, like a tiny marine worm called Romanchella perrieri, grew 70 percent larger in the warmed waters versus the control. Ashton told me the researchers try not the extrapolate what these results might mean for warming across the Antarctic, but she said because these species are all at the bottom of the food chain; It's likely that a change in their ecosystem and diversity would impact all the organisms further up the food chain, including humans. ""These results suggest you would see major changes in the seafloor community both in the rate of growth but also in a change of biodiversity,"" Ashton said. A study earlier this year found that ocean temperatures are rising faster than we thought, and are accelerating, which is why understanding the possible impacts—and whether we might be able to adjust for them—is so important. When just one degree can make such a significant difference, it makes you wonder what three or four degrees might mean.

2017-06-19 13:38:00,2017,6.0,19,European Politicians Are Fighting to Ban Backdoors Into Encrypted Messaging Apps," Despite swelling surveillance powers creeping across Europe, a European Parliament proposal is actually calling for a ban on ""backdoors"" that allow law enforcement agencies and governments into encrypted communications such as WhatsApp messages.  In amendments to proposals on personal data, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs now says, ""when encryption of electronic communications data is used, decryption, reverse engineering or monitoring of such communications shall be prohibited.""  But privacy experts have told Motherboard the proposals are unlikely to win the support of EU member countries, especially Britain, where the Investigatory Powers Act combined with Brexit makes such a privacy u-turns improbable.  ""I think we can safely say that the UK government won't accept them,"" Paul Bernal, law lecturer at the University of East Anglia, told Motherboard. ""But given Brexit that's very unlikely to have an influence.""  Bernal also doesn't expect the changes to be accepted in their current form, but that they are an indication of where things are headed.  ""Those wanting backdoors and limitations on encryption use will almost certainly end up on the 'wrong side of history'. A secure and privacy-friendly internet is for the benefit of all, in the end,"" he told Motherboard.  The amendments state that EU member countries should not impose any obligations on Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that would result in the weakening of the security and encryption of their services.  But the new proposal's aims go head to head with powers ogled by leaders like Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May, who earlier this month demanded that extremists be deprived of online ""safe spaces"", such as those provided by secure messaging apps WhatsApp and Signal. In Germany, too, government ministers want to give German law enforcement powers to monitor WhatsApp and Telegram chats.  ""The providers of electronic communications services shall ensure that there is sufficient protection in place against unauthorised access or alterations to the electronic communications data, and that the confidentiality and safety of the transmission are also guaranteed by the nature of the means of transmission used or by state-of-the-art end-to-end encryption of the electronic communications data,"" states the proposal.  UK privacy charity Privacy International told Motherboard that the proposal doesn't go far enough, however. In a statement provided to Motherboard, Privacy International's legal officer Tomaso Falchetta said, ""Privacy International would like to see privacy be baked into products and services from the beginning and to see such practices reflected in the regulation. This would require companies to, by default, offer privacy protective settings, to prevent other parties from storing information on devices of a user, and from processing information already stored on that device.""  But with Germany now joining the UK and the US now working hard on passing laws that provide backdoors to end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms for law enforcement agencies, such as the Investigatory Power Act, the proposal is likely to receive much opposition. Indeed, Motherboard understands from another legal expert that this proposal, as it is coming from just one committee, is unlikely to be accepted by many member states without exceptions for law enforcements and national security agencies. In the US, for example, this type of bill would have explicitly prevented the FBI from demanding Apple make a backdoor into its iPhone software in order to access the chat logs of the San Bernardino shooter.  The proposal will soon head to the EU council, where it will have to be reviewed by other members of the European parliament before being passed. The UK's Brexit negotiations have also commenced today, and it is unclear what the proposal's changes could mean for Theresa May's encryption plans.

2020-02-11 00:00:00,2020,2.0,11,"Demand for streaming TV services remains strong, Nielsen survey suggests","(Reuters) - Consumers love streamed TV and film and want content providers to keep it coming, a new survey from U.S. data and measurement firm Nielsen suggests. In a survey it conducted for its latest Total Audience Report, Nielsen found that, even as the number of streaming services rise, 93% of respondents would keep paying for the ones they have or subscribe to others. Technology and media investors fear the market may be becoming too crowded to accommodate new services. But the Nielsen survey suggests consumers will keep signing up. In 2019, the U.S. audience could choose from over 646,000 different titles across traditional broadcast TV and streaming platforms, up nearly 10% from 2018, according to Nielsen. Of those, about 9% were only available on a streaming service such as Netflix, Walt Disney Co’s Disney+, Apple Inc’s Apple TV+ or ViacomCBS’s CBS All Access. Streaming is particularly popular among young adults. Among 18- to 34-year-olds who participated in the Nielsen survey, 96% subscribe to a paid streaming video service, compared to 91% among all consumers of all ages. Nearly one-third of all respondents and almost half of respondents aged 18 to 34 say they subscribe to three or more paid services - leaving plenty of room for AT&T- owned WarnerMedia’s HBO Max and Comcast’s Peacock streaming services, which are launching this year.

2017-11-29 19:06:28,2017,11.0,29,Amazon Trumpets Its Cloud Lead With N.F.L. and Other Deals,"SEATTLE — The holidays are a time when there are constant reminders of how much Amazon dominates online shopping — the boxes stacking up on front porches, for example. It’s also when Amazon puffs its chest out to say how big it is becoming in a different and much more profitable market: technology used by businesses. The company’s self-confidence was on display on Wednesday at an annual conference in Las Vegas dedicated to Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business. Amazon boasted of its leading cloud share, which analysts estimate is more than 44 percent of the market. And it showed a parade of big companies, like Expedia and Walt Disney, that run its software inside Amazon data centers. One of the customers that Amazon revealed, the National Football League, illustrated how cloud computing is moving beyond basic capabilities like online storage. Those abilities first attracted start-ups and large corporations to the concept of renting computing services from an internet company, rather than running it all themselves. The N.F.L. said it would use Amazon’s advanced machine-learning capabilities — software that helps recognize patterns and make predictions — to quickly analyze data captured during games. The data could provide new kinds of statistics for fans and insights that could help coaches. In a phone interview, Michelle McKenna-Doyle, the N.F.L.’s senior vice president of information technology, called the new game analysis it plans to offer using Amazon “instant quarterbacking,” a nod to Monday morning quarterbacking, the traditional postgame discussions fans often hold. Amazon is also becoming an official technology sponsor of the N.F.L.’s next gen stats, as the league’s initiative is called. The N.F.L. and Amazon declined to discuss the financial terms of their relationship. Amazon also announced a handful of other new machine-learning efforts. Customers using A.W.S., as the cloud division within Amazon is often called, will be able to add capabilities that mimic human cognition, such as automatic transcribing of speech to text and analysis of videos. Those services are usually expensive and daunting for many companies to add to their applications Amazon also said it would begin selling a new camera with machine learning built into it, A.W.S. DeepLens, so software developers can practice with the technology. Amazon said the camera could allow a garage door opener to automatically open when it recognizes a license plate on a car. A.W.S. started as a curious side project for the internet retailer more than a decade ago. It has since mushroomed into one of the most important technology providers. It brought in over $12 billion in revenue for Amazon during the first nine months of the year, up 42 percent from a year earlier. More important, A.W.S. generated almost $3 billion in operating income, an enormous benefit to a company which brings in little to no profit from its retail operations. The chief executive of A.W.S., Andy Jassy, predicted in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday that the company’s cloud business could eventually become the world’s largest technology provider to businesses. To do so, it would have to displace large software companies like Microsoft and Oracle. Mr. Jassy tweaked established technology providers in a keynote speech, describing their treatment of customers as an “abusive relationship.” Amazon has caught most of the industry by surprise with its growth into a cloud computing powerhouse. Two rivals, Microsoft and Google, have shown the most determination to narrow Amazon’s lead. Both competitors are also investing heavily in giving machine-learning capabilities to customers. Urs Hölzle, Google’s senior vice president of technical infrastructure, said his company saw the biggest opportunity in winning over the huge numbers of customers who have not yet shifted their computing chores to the cloud, rather than convincing those that have already adopted Amazon’s services to do so. “For us to grow very quickly, we don’t need to steal A.W.S. users,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/technology/amazon-cloud-nfl-deals.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,640

Rather, Facebook Head of Global Policy Management Monika Bickert told Anderson Cooper that the company would be de-prioritizing, or pushing the post down, in people’s news feeds, and putting the video alongside third party fact-checker information.  Facebook’s decision was polarizing, and people were immediately divided into two camps. One camp argues that Facebook can't, at scale, create and implement a policy to deal with videos like the one of Nancy Pelosi. The other camp argues that there  is a responsible way to moderate that type of content, and we have to explore it. It’s understandable that people were upset with Facebook’s response, given the platform’s inadequate response to misinformation in the 2016 election. Although we don’t know precisely how many people were swayed by Russia’s coordinated misinformation campaign through the Internet Research Agency, we do know that a significant amount of Facebook users were reached, unimpeded. For instance, Recode's Kara Swisher wrote in the  New York Times, ""the only thing the incident shows is how expert Facebook has become at blurring the lines between simple mistakes and deliberate deception, thereby abrogating its responsibility as the key distributor of news on the planet."" But there’s not necessarily a clear “right” answer here. Rather, the Nancy Pelosi video illustrates that people will accept any evidence that confirms their pre-existing world view. It also shows that content moderation—an already difficult task of anticipating and creating a policy for every possible social situation—is monumentally more difficult when you’re building it into your platform after it’s been adopted by over 2 billion people. It  is difficult, at times, to distinguish between mistakes, satire, and deliberate deception. It’s particularly difficult in the case of a viral video such as that of Nancy Pelosi, where some users sharing the video think it’s real, while others think it’s satire. Should it matter that the video has been shared widely, or shared by the president? Do comments on the video or the text used to share it matter? If you’re crafting a policy that’s based on intent to deceive, how do you account for situations where intent is either unclear or inconsistent among users? Fight for the Future's Evan Greer said that content like the Nancy Pelosi video occupies a grey area where it’s functionally the same, ""from a legal and technological standpoint,” as John Oliver videos that edit videos of politicians as a form of satire. By removing the Nancy Pelosi video, Facebook wouldn’t just be defining where satire becomes misinformation in  that situation. The company would also be crafting a precedent that could be applied to other situations—situations where the target may not be Nancy Pelosi, but Trump, or figures scrutinized by the left or in other countries, in other contexts.  What if Facebook started doing takedowns of clips of late night television, citing the reason as “misinformation”? Neil Potts, Facebook’s director of public policy, said that this is why the Nancy Pelosi video needs to stay up.  As pointed out by Microsoft researcher Tarleton Gillespie, Facebook actually  did try labelling certain articles as “satire” back in 2014. But the satire tag was only tested and never implemented at scale. Jillian York, director for international freedom of expression for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, similarly argues that if we give Facebook the power to draw black-and-white rules for what’s satire and what’s not, the platform will get it wrong and apply it inconsistently to non-U.S. or non-English-speaking countries. However, other people argue that it  is possible to craft a moderation policy that goes further than Facebook currently does. Emily Gorcenski, a data scientist focused on documenting white supremacists, argued that Facebook should enforce specific policies at the level of influential, public-facing government officials rather than ordinary users. On paper, she said, this approach to content moderation is easier to enforce than blanket policies.  But this solution might, in fact, be difficult to implement. On Twitter, world leaders and politicians are granted power to  circumvent the platform’s rules because, according to Twitter, suspending or punishing public figures would “hide important information people should be able to see and debate.”  Sam Gregory, program director for Witness, said in an email that platforms like Facebook should tell users how videos may have been altered, and also “set fair, transparent rules” that allow for maximum freedom of expression. But it’s difficult to craft these rules when public figures are involved. “Unless we're going to engage in digital NIMBYism and say that the Pelosi video only matters because it's a US political figure,” Gregory said, “then we need to think about how we set a standard that won't be exploited by unscrupulous and authoritarian governments worldwide to dismiss legitimate speech as offensive or to falsely claim that something is a fake when it isn't.” Gillespie said in an email that grey areas of content moderation like the Nancy Pelosi video often come down to human judgement, and maybe the people best suited to be making those judgements are  users, not Facebook. “It’s impossible to draw a line in the sand, that cleanly separates the manipulated Pelosi video on the one hand, and lots of other edited-together political videos on the other,” Gillespie said. “I'm not talking about some ‘Supreme Court’ oversight board, and I don't just mean individuals can choose to block content for themselves. I mean: more of this decision could belong to the users and communities involved.” Community knowledge is a valuable tool when making difficult decisions, but it also isn’t perfect. Consider Reddit, which empowers the moderators of subreddit communities to make and enforce rules for their subreddits. This has bred subreddits that are friendly to white supremacy, misogyny, and transphobia, and subreddits that launch coordinated harassment attacks against other subreddits.  Corynne McSherry, legal director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that it’s important to think of content moderation as a set of tools that goes beyond content takedowns. “Too often, platforms and users assume the only option is to take content down or not,” McSherry said. “But there are other options—like providing additional information. We also need more tools for users, so they have the ability to control their internet experience based on their own judgment.” Still, that’s not to say Facebook’s current policy of de-prioritizing and fact-checking the Nancy Pelosi video is necessarily the “correct” approach. After all, using fact-checking as a mode of combating misinformation falsely assumes that people can and will change their minds once presented with facts. It’s the same problem with YouTube’s Wikipedia fact-checking program to combat conspiracy theories. People will believe what they want to believe, and there’s no simple way to construct a platform policy that combats the core issues of media illiteracy and filter bubbles.  People, disproportionately older Americans, cannot universally agree on what is true or false, what is fake news and what is real news. It's no surprise, then, that Facebook doesn't seem to know, either.

2017-09-08 00:00:00,2017,9.0,8,FDA OKs new peanut allergy food labels," (CNN)The US Food and Drug Administration announced new labels for peanut-containing foods suitable for infants this week, noting that they may reduce the risk of developing an allergy.  In a statement Thursday, Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said the agency would allow updated labels on some peanut-containing foods in light of a recent study, as well as National Institutes of Health recommendations released in January. The clinical trial found that introducing foods containing smooth peanut butter to infants who were at high risk of a peanut allergy dramatically reduced their risk of developing it in childhood. The guidelines released in January offered details on when and how parents can introduce peanut-containing foods to children, including those at high risk of developing an allergy.  For many years, parents were told to avoid exposing high-risk children to peanuts. Gottlieb noted in his statement that ""new evidence-based guidelines recommend that the medical community consider a different approach."" The guidelines now recommend that ""parents of infants with severe eczema, egg allergy, or both introduce peanut-containing foods into a child's diet as early as 4 to 6 months of age.""  The statement said this is the first time the FDA has recognized a qualified health claim to prevent a food allergy.  Products are already labeled with allergy-causing ingredients, including peanuts. The new labeling will advise parents to check with a child's doctor before introducing peanut-containing foods. This does not change the warning against whole peanuts, as they ""are a choking hazard for young children and should not be consumed."" The new label will read, ""For most infants with severe eczema and/or egg allergy who are already eating solid foods, introducing foods containing ground peanuts between 4 and 10 months of age and continuing consumption may reduce the risk of developing peanut allergy by 5 years of age. FDA has determined, however, that the evidence supporting this claim is limited to one study. ""If your infant has severe eczema and/or egg allergy, check with your infant's healthcare provider before feeding foods containing ground peanuts."" Peanut allergy is one of the most common food allergies in the United States, with rates doubling from 1997 to 2008. Currently, about 2% of American children are allergic to peanuts. A serious reaction can lead to anaphylaxis and, rarely, death. For children who have a high risk of developing a peanut allergy, doctors previously advised parents to hold off on introducing peanut-containing foods until the age of 3.  The National Institutes of Health's peanut allergy recommendations have been supported by several groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Dr. Michael Pistiner, a spokesman for the pediatric group, said the changes announced this week ""will increase awareness about early introduction of peanut protein"" for parents and healthcare providers. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, noted that the guidelines introduced in January are ""simple and straightforward.""  ""If your child is having reactions to foods, go to your pediatrician or allergist and get a skin test and then begin to introduce peanut based foods around 4 to 6 months,"" he said. ""If your child has mild to moderate allergies, aim for around 6 months."" And for infants showing no signs of food allergies and no family history, ""don't worry."" Fauci tells parents to introduce foods according to their ""families' preferences and cultural practices.""

2019-11-20 00:00:00,2019,11.0,20,Amazon's Ring doorbells scrutinized in Senators' letter to Bezos,"Five Democratic senators called on Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to explain how his home security company Ring retains and secures customers' data and videos. In a letter Wednesday, Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Chris Coons of Delaware and Gary Peters of Michigan raised concerns that Ring's data could be hacked or accessed by foreign actors. If accessed improperly, Ring's products, which include internet connected video doorbells and alarm systems, could pose a risk not only to individual Americans, but also U.S. national security, the senators said. ""Personal data can be exploited by foreign intelligence services to amplify the impact of espionage and influence operations,"" the senators wrote. Amazon bought Ring in February 2018. It now operates as a subsidiary of Amazon. A Ring spokesperson said the company is still reviewing Wednesday's letter but provided comment on Markey's earlier letters to the company and pointed to a blog post explaining how Ring works with law enforcement. ""Ring users place their trust in us to help protect their homes and communities, and we take that responsibility very seriously,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""Ring does not own or otherwise control users' videos, and we intentionally designed the Neighbors Portal to ensure that users get to decide whether or not to voluntarily provide their videos to the police."" The lawmakers referred to reported incidents of Ring's vulnerabilities being exploited, including one last week that said Ring doorbells left users' Wi-Fi passwords exposed in unencrypted text. Amazon fixed the problem in September, although the vulnerability wasn't disclosed until last week, TechCrunch reported. The letter also pointed to a report from The Intercept earlier this year that found Ring employees in Ukraine were granted ""virtually unfettered access"" to videos from Ring cameras around the world that they could access with ""little more than a click."" ""These reports raise serious concerns about Ring's internal cybersecurity and privacy safeguards, particularly if employees and contractors in foreign countries have access to American consumers' data,"" the lawmakers wrote. The letter comes one day after Markey released the findings of an investigation he led into Ring. Markey concluded that Ring does not have security requirements for law enforcement offices to gain access to users' footage, does not restrict those offices from sharing footage with third parties and does not commit to refrain from selling users' biometric data. ""Amazon Ring's policies are an open door for privacy and civil liberty violations,"" Markey said in a statement announcing the findings. ""If you're an adult walking your dog or a child playing on the sidewalk, you shouldn't have to worry that Ring's products are amassing footage of you and that law enforcement may hold that footage indefinitely or share that footage with any third parties. Amazon's Ring is marketed to help keep families safe, but privacy rights are in real danger as a result of company policies. Amazon is not doing enough to ensure that its products and practices do not run afoul of our civil liberties.""

2018-03-28 00:00:00,2018,3.0,28,Teva wins reversal of U.S. jury's $235 million GSK drug patent verdict,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday overturned a U.S. jury’s verdict that required Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd to pay GlaxoSmithKline Plc more than $235 million for infringing a patent covering its blood pressure drug Coreg. U.S. District Judge Leonard Stark in Wilmington, Delaware ruled that the evidence did not support the jury’s finding in June that Teva sales of a generic version of the drug caused doctors to infringe GSK’s patent. The jury had awarded GSK $234.1 million in lost profits and said the drug company deserved an additional $1.4 million in royalties. It also had rejected Teva’s contention that the patent was invalid, a decision Stark did not overturn. “We are disappointed with the judge’s decision and are reviewing our options,” British drugmaker GSK said in a statement. Israel-based Teva declined to comment. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Teva’s generic version of Coreg, or carvedilol, in 2007. GSK had alleged that while Teva’s FDA application had a carve-out to address its use for treating chronic heart failure, which GSK said remained under patent, the generic drugmaker changed its label in 2011 to add that use. GSK said that as a result, Teva caused doctors to infringe its patent by selling a generic version of the drug and marketing it as a substitute for Coreg. But in his ruling on Wednesday, Stark said that the evidence did not support finding that Teva’s actions as opposed to other factors induced doctors into infringing the patent by prescribing generic carvedilol to treat chronic heart failure. “Without proof of causation, which is an essential element of GSK’s action, a finding of inducement cannot stand,” Stark wrote. The case is GlaxoSmithKline LLC et al v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware, No. 14-cv-00878.

Scott, 54, returned in March 2016 from a year aboard the International Space Station — but 7 percent of his genes had changed. In the two years since, they have not returned to normal, NASA says. Scott’s 340-day stay was longer than NASA’s typical six-month deployments to space, and while it is known that a person’s genes change away from Earth, they did not expect his genes to stay altered. NASA says the 7 percent DNA changes, which they call “space genes,” bring up “possible longer term changes in genes related to his immune system, DNA repair, bone formation networks, hypoxia, and hypercapnia.” As identical twins, Scott and Mark, who is also a former astronaut, were purposefully studied before, during and after Scott’s mission to research the changes that occur in space. Scott tweeted on Saturday that he wasn’t aware of his “space genes” until reading about it in a Newsweek article. “What? My DNA changed by 7%! Who knew? I just learned about it in this article,” he tweeted, joking: “This could be good news! I no longer have to call @ShuttleCDRKelly my identical twin brother anymore.” What? My DNA changed by 7%!

2017-03-23 00:00:00,2017,3.0,23,New CBO estimate shows smaller savings from Obamacare replacement,"The revised Obamacare replacement plan being promoted by Congressional Republican leaders would not cause any bigger drops in the number of Americans with health insurance than the original bill, but would realize less budget savings, a new analysis released Thursday said. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the revised GOP bill would realize $150 billion in reduced federal spending through 2026, which is less than half of the $337 billion in deficit reductions that the CBO had estimated for the bill's first version. The difference in savings is largely the result of an amendment that would set a lower threshold for deducting medical expenses from income taxes. But the newer version, like the first, is expected to lead to 14 million fewer people having health insurance in 2018, and 24 million fewer insured Americans by 2026 than would be covered if Obamacare remained as law in its current form. In 2026, an estimated total of 52 million people nationally would lack health coverage if the revised bill becomes law, according to the CBO's projection. However, if Obamacare remained in effect, 28 million Americans would not have insurance by that year, according to the CBO. The revised bill also is projected to have the same effect on insurance premiums as the original Republican proposal, according to the non-partisan CBO. Average premiums for single customers in the individual health plan market are still estimated to be 15 percent to 20 percent higher in 2018 and 2019 if the bill becomes law than would be the case under Obamacare. But average premiums by 2026 are projected to be 10 percent lower than they otherwise would be under Obamacare, the CBO said. The CBO's new report was issued about two hours after Republican leaders in the House of Representatives postponed a vote on an expected third version of the replacement bill due to their inability to convince enough members of the GOP caucus to support it, and ensure passage. That version has not yet received a ""score"" from the CBO as the other two versions have because it is not yet finalized. The second version, which was the subject of CBO's report on Thursday, was only introduced early this week by GOP leaders in an effort to drum up support for the replacement plan. A number of conservative Republicans in Congress have opposed both versions of the GOP billl, saying they don't go far enough to repeal Obamacare. The GOP bill would repeal the Obamacare mandate that requires most Americans to have insurance or pay a fine. It also would scale back the amount of subsidies the federal government provides to people who buy insurance on the individual market, and make changes in the way the government provides funding to states for their Medicaid programs. The replacement plan also would undo several Obamacare taxes that affect wealthy people. While those tax repeals would reduce revenue for the federal government, the loss of those axes would be more than offset by the reduced spending to help people afford their insurance coverage. After the first version was publicly introduced, concerns were raised that the bill, due to the way it changed how subsidies were awarded to insurance customers, would lead to steep increases in premiums for people who are older, have lower incomes and live in rural areas. GOP leaders then amended the bill to allow a lower income threshold for deducting the cost of medical expenses from income taxes. The second version also repeals a set of Obamacare taxes this year as opposed to next year, allows states to impose work requirements for Medicaid, and also allows states to receive block grants for the Medicaid programs.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/23/new-cbo-estimate-shows-smaller-savings-from-revised-gop-obamacare-replacement-plan-similar-coverage-losses-as-prior-bill.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,611
2017-05-01 00:00:00,2017,5.0,1,Disability can linger years after mild wartime brain injuries,"Military service members who sustain concussions in combat may experience worsening symptoms for several years after their injuries, particularly if they have psychiatric problems, a small U.S. study suggests. About one in five U.S. service members deployed in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan suffered a head injury, researchers note in JAMA Neurology. Most of them endured mild uncomplicated brain injuries or concussions. Previous research has linked these injuries to multiple mental health problems but hasn’t provided a clear picture of exactly what influences the severity or duration of symptoms. For the current study, researchers compared health outcomes over five years for 50 active-duty service members with combat experience who sustained combat concussions and 44 who didn’t suffer brain injuries. With concussions, combat veterans were more likely to have post-traumatic stress disorder, severe depression, anxiety and sleep difficulties. The study also found that after a concussion, symptoms got worse from one to five years following the injury. This suggests one common assumption guiding concussion treatment - that patients tend to stabilize within a year of their injuries - might not always be right, said lead study author Christine Mac Donald of the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle. “In short, there is nothing ‘mild’ about these injuries,” Mac Donald said by email. “There is evolution not resolution of symptoms that occur years after these exposures and we in the medical research community should not only be working hard to develop therapies that can be administered acutely after injury but also, and this is a bit of a paradigm shift, focus on developing therapies and treatment strategies targeted to the chronic phase of injury as well,” Mac Donald added. All of the service members with concussions had been evacuated from Afghanistan to a medical center in Germany for treatment between 2008 and 2013. Study participants without concussions had received treatment for noncombat health problems like gastrointestinal tract issues or dermatitis. At one and five years after joining the study, 36 of the 50 concussion patients, or 72 percent, had declining scores on an evaluation that measures overall disability. In addition, satisfaction with life, disability, and the severity of neurobehavioral and psychiatric symptoms were worse with patients who had concussions than participants who didn’t have brain injuries. However, people with and without concussions performed similarly on cognitive function tests after five years. Some of the factors that might increase the odds of worse outcomes after five years include the brain injury diagnosis as well as pre-injury intelligence, motor strength, verbal fluency and neurobehavioral symptoms like headache, insomnia, fatigue and depression, the study also found. While the study is small, and more research is needed in larger groups of concussion patients in the military and other populations, the authors conclude that psychiatric symptoms rather than cognitive deficits may be driving long-term symptoms. The military has a comprehensive approach to treating battlefield concussions, which is one of the key advances from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, noted Dr. Jack Tsao, coauthor of an accompanying editorial and a researcher at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and the Memphis Veterans Affairs Medical Center. “Focusing on mild traumatic brain injuries, in the period immediately following concussion or mild traumatic brain injury, we know that injured service members typically make an excellent recovery and are able to return to full duty,” Tsao said by email. “The focus of treatment immediately following injury is rest and education about what to expect during recovery, similar to what is recommended for a sports- or accident-related concussion,” Tsao added. “If symptoms persist and become diagnosed as persistent post-concussive syndrome or if new mental health conditions emerge and are diagnosed, additional treatment targeted towards the symptoms is warranted.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2qw8FMa JAMA Neurology, online May 1, 2017.

2017-10-23 00:00:00,2017,10.0,23,Global study reveals 72 gene mutations that lead to breast cancer," (CNN)The genetic causes of breast cancer just got clearer.  Researchers from 300 institutions around the world combined forces to discover 72 previously unknown gene mutations that lead to the development of breast cancer. Two studies describing their work published Monday in the journals Nature and Nature Genetics. The teams found that 65 of the newly identified genetic variants are common among women with breast cancer.  The remaining seven mutations predispose women to developing a type of breast cancer known as estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer, which doesn't respond to hormonal therapies, such as the drug tamoxifen.  The new discoveries add to previous research bringing the total number of known variants associated with breast cancer to nearly 180. Beyond BRCA1 and BRCA2  The international team of 550 researchers across six continents, known as the OncoArray Consortium, included professor Doug Easton of the University of Cambridge, who led the investigation. ""Essentially, we used blood samples from a very large number of women (nearly 300,000), about half of whom had had breast cancer,"" Easton explained in an email. Next, the researchers used the DNA from the samples to look for genetic mutations. ""Think of a gene as a very long strand of DNA,"" said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, who was not involved in the research. DNA is made up of nucleic acids, and when a nucleic acid is incorrectly placed along the strand, this is referred to as a genetic mutation, noted Brawley.  Take BRCA1 and BRCA2, two well-known genes that confer a high risk of breast cancer when they contain mutations.   There are 125,950 base pairs in the BRCA 1 mutation, noted Brawley. ""Think of it as a 125,950 letter word,"" said Brawley. ""A mutation is a misspelling such that the gene cannot code the proper protein."" A gene that cannot code the proper protein leads to disease.  According to the National Cancer Institute, 55% to 65% of women who inherit a BRCA1 mutation and around 45% of women who inherit a BRCA2 mutation will develop breast cancer by age 70.   However, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 risk mutations, which are present in less than 1% of women, explain only a fraction of all inherited breast cancers.  The consortium came together, then, to discover the other causes of breast cancer susceptibility -- the additional genetic mutations that can lead to this form of cancer. Finding the other mutations The researchers measured DNA at over 10 million sites across the genome, said professor Peter Kraft of Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, a study author.  ""At each of these sites, we asked whether the DNA sequence in women with breast cancer was different than that in women without,"" said Kraft. ""Because our study was so large, we could detect subtle differences between these two groups of women and be sure these differences were not due to chance."" According to Jacques Simard, a study author and professor and researcher at Université Laval, Quebec City, the newly discovered mutations only slightly -- by anywhere from 5% to 10% -- increase a woman's risk of developing breast cancer. But even though, individually, these mutations don't have as big as an effect as BRCA1 and BRCA2 defects, there are many of them, so their ""overall contribution is larger,"" said Easton. An individual woman, then, may have two or more of these common smaller risk gene mutations, and so her risk for developing breast cancer increases due to their combined effects. Kraft noted that ""taken together, these risk variants may identify a small proportion of women who are at 3-times increased risk of breast cancer."" Women found to have a number of these smaller risk genetic mutations, then, would likely benefit from earlier mammography screening. Simard agreed, noting that it may be time to ""adapt"" breast cancer screening guidelines based on this information instead of basing mammography guidelines on age alone. By doing so, Simard said, ""we will detect a higher number of breast cancers.""  Quantifying cancer risk Brawley described the new research as ""not earth-shattering."" It is ""most important for us nerds,"" he said, but less so for the general public. These types of studies help experts identify mutations that ""help us quantify the risk,"" said Brawley.  ""It helps us figure out that a non-patient, often a relative of a cancer patient, is at risk and helps us quantify that risk."" Normal lifetime risk of breast cancer is 12.5% for women in the US, said Brawley. Lisa Schlager, vice president of community affairs & public policy for the nonprofit FORCE (Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered), said past studies and evidence indicate that about 10% of breast cancers are hereditary.  ""This new information may mean that that estimate is low,"" said Schlager.   It is important for patients to know whether their cancer is due to an inherited genetic mutation because they may be at increased risk of other cancers or their treatment recommendations may differ based on that fact, said Schlager.  ""And their family members may be affected with the same mutation,"" said Schlager. Enabling personalized medicine For the promise of personalized medicine to be realized, our government and health system need to ""embrace the ability to use genetic information to tailor health care by providing affordable access to the needed screening and preventive interventions,"" said Schlager. As it stands now, men with BRCA mutations as well as some women may not be covered for screening by their insurance in the US. Brawley said ""this type of genome wide screening has and is being used to identify genes that are associated with increased risk of a number of diseases, including diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, stroke and heart disease."" ""The same methodology can be used for other cancers,"" said Easton. The screening method used by the consortium, the OncoArray, was designed to be used in many other cancer types, including prostate, ovary, colorectal and lung cancer, he said.  Simard added that the cost of the genetic screen is ""quite cheap,"" at less than $50 per individual. ""We can use just a blood sample or saliva sample. It's not difficult to obtain the material for a genetic analysis,"" he added. Kraft said it was important to keep in mind that the study was conducted primarily among women of European ancestry.  ""For sure we have missed some variants associated with cancers that are common in some non-European populations but rare in Europeans,"" said Kraft.  To find these, cancer genetic studies in Africans, African Americans, Latinas, Chinese and other populations are ongoing, he added. Easton commented that most of the newly identified variants ""are in regions of the genome that regulate nearby genes."" These may someday serve as targets for new therapies or drugs to cure the disease. In the end, the most important lesson here is the fact that this research has been a collaborative effort, said Simard.  ""Scientists are not in competition against each other,"" he said. ""We are really working together to expedite and to accelerate the discovery."" ",https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/23/health/72-new-breast-cancer-mutations-study/index.html,health,CNN,health,1164

2018-08-29 00:00:00,2018,8.0,29,'Fake meat' is at the center of food fight in Missouri ," (CNN)Don't call it meat if it doesn't come from livestock or poultry, a new Missouri law says. The state law that went into effect Tuesday prohibits food companies from marketing products that are not ""derived from harvested production livestock or poultry"" as meat. And violators could receive a fine of up to $1,000 and spend up to a year in jail.  The law would apply to meat substitutes such as soy-based, plant-based meat, which have become increasingly popular in recent years, and also ""clean"" meat, which is produced by growing and multiplying cells in a lab and is close to hitting the consumer market.  The new measure is drawing backlash from a range of organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, the Animal Legal Defense Fund, the Good Food Institute and the company that produces Tofurky. The groups immediately filed a legal challenge in federal court saying the state law attempts to ""stifle the growing grocery category of plant-based meat.""  ""As more and more consumers are making the conscious choice to remove animals from their plates, Missouri is putting its thumb on the scale to unfairly benefit the meat industry and silence alternative producers,"" Stephen Wells, executive director of the Animal Legal Defense Fund, said in a statement. ""This law violates various constitutional principles, including free speech -- which should be a concern for everyone, regardless of diet."" But to the Missouri Cattlemen's Association, which supported the bill, the issue is ""all about marketing with integrity.""  ""MCA will not stand for laboratory grown food or plant based meat alternatives to be marketed as something it's not,"" the association said on its website regarding its legislative priorities for the year. Meat-substitute supporters claim their companies have never violated regulations by the US Food and Drug Administration or the Federal Trade Commission that prohibit the misrepresentation of food products.  A spokeswoman for Attorney General Josh Hawley's office said the state is ready to enforce the law, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. ""The attorney general's office will carefully review all referrals from the Department of Agriculture and will take legal action as appropriate under the circumstances to protect Missouri consumers,"" spokeswoman Mary Compton told the Post-Dispatch newspaper, which is also a CNN affiliate.

2017-02-11 09:00:04,2017,2.0,11,"Farhad and Mike’s Week in Tech: All Trump, All the Time","Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Farhad: Hello, Michael. It’s snowing in New York and it’s raining in San Francisco. And in Washington, the president is exploring the White House in his bathrobe. That’s a reference to an article from five ancient news cycles ago, but it was the highlight of my week. If I were president, I too would wander around in my old robe. That’s my house, you know what I mean? I want to be comfortable. Mike: The only time I ever wear bathrobes is when I stay in hotels on work trips. I feel like a king of a very small house in a foreign land, and I like to do extravagant things like order room service and watch pay-per-view movies. In completely unrelated news, I’ve been having some trouble with my expense reports. Farhad: O.K., so pretty much the only tech news this week was Trump news. Even earnings reports were just more Trump news. For instance, Twitter. Its earnings were embarrassing and its stock plunged. That was a cue for a lot of people online to joke about how Trump hasn’t even managed to make Twitter great again. Mike: Yeah, I was on their earnings call with investors, and all the Wall Street analysts were incredulous that Twitter didn’t get a “Trump bump” from all of his nutty tweets. I was sort of shocked too, but again, it’s not like we can’t find his latest tweet plastered across CNN, or The New York Times, or any other news outlet. Farhad: I think Trump and other newsmakers’ use of Twitter might be starting to hurt Twitter’s brand. After all, if you’re a would-be Twitter user who sees this stream of CRAZY PRESIDENTIAL TWEETS!! on TV every night, wouldn’t you think of Twitter as just a really unpleasant place to visit? Mike: Well, you and I are also fixtures on Twitter, so maybe it’s a wash? Or maybe that’s wishful thinking. Farhad: Also, Expedia had a noteworthy earnings call. In his closing remarks, the chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, thanked his employees for their work in 2016, then added, “Hopefully we will all be alive to see the end of next year.” Expedia: Safe Travels, Unless There’s a Nuclear War. He’s a member of The New York Times Company’s board of directors, by the way. I think I’m obliged to mention that. Mike: O.K., that’s kind of funny. And really, a lot of people have been ending their conversations with me like that. It’s an odd way of acknowledging that the world is totally upside down from where it was one month ago. Take “Saturday Night Live.” It’s basically a political sketch comedy show now. It’s always about Trump, or in last week’s case, Sean Spicer and his lectern assaults on the press. Everything is political now — 10 times more so than ever before. Farhad: Yeah. The big story in tech was the same big story as everywhere else: Trump’s travel ban and the response to it. Early in the week, about 130 technology companies signed on to a legal brief in support of the court fight against the executive order. The list included most of the household names in tech, including several of the biggest companies. Mike: And Chobani! The wokest yogurt brand, period. Farhad: As our colleague David Streitfeld reported, a lot of the push for the companies to take a strong stand against the president came from employees. There are lots of immigrants here, and as I argued this week, the whole place really wouldn’t work without immigration. What’s striking to me, though, is just how energized everyone here seems to be. I don’t know about you, but every conversation I had with people in tech this week started with some recap of the news and how people were responding to it. This is not normal in the tech industry! I just don’t know people here to voluntarily bring up politics, and to even express their political views, just voluntarily. It’s not really how tech people roll. But this week, everyone was just so … woke. I really think Trump has changed something in the culture here. It could fizzle. But for now, something’s different. Don’t you think? Mike: I do! Part of it is just that you really, really cannot escape political news right now. Trump has signed so many executive orders since coming into office, it’s difficult to keep up with them all. But more than that, I think about how folks in tech have positioned themselves over the past 10 years or so. Joining a technology company isn’t something you do these days to build a better microwave. At Facebook, you’re trying to connect the entire world. At Twitter, it’s about giving a voice to everyone. At Apple, it’s … about making a lot of money on phones. You’re buying into the mission, and where you work in Silicon Valley says a lot about you and your values. That, and the amount of lucrative stock options you may be sitting on. So when someone like Trump comes in and stomps all over a great deal of those values — openness, inclusion, connectivity — I would be shocked if there wasn’t an outpouring of emotion or pushback from the rank and file. Chief executives, on the other hand, had to deal with things at a trickier level. If they are comfortable speaking out about the mission of their companies when things are easy but clam up when things go sideways, well, that’s just sad. (Sad!) And I think a lot of employees realized this and pushed back internally on their bosses, which ultimately forced a lot of the execs to act. And it’s kind of hard to argue that sticking by your values isn’t a good thing. So I guess what I’m saying is: Stay woke. Until next week? Farhad: See ya!",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/technology/farhad-and-mikes-week-in-tech-all-trump-all-the-time.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,1010

The move is part of a global effort being led by the INTERPOL, the world’s largest police organization, to identify the makers and distributors of illegal prescription drugs. The FDA said its Office of Criminal Investigations, Office of Regulatory Affairs, and Center for Drug Evaluation and Research were part of the enforcement action, which ran from May 31 to June 7. (1.usa.gov/1UDxltm) The FDA and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection inspected international mail facilities (IMFs), and then sent formal complaints to domain registrars requesting the suspension of the 4,402 websites, the U.S. health regulator said. In addition, the FDA said it has also issued warning letters to operators of 53 websites that illegally sell unapproved and misbranded prescription drug products to U.S. consumers. The FDA said it and other federal agencies screened and seized illegal drug products received through IMFs in San Francisco, Chicago, and New York. These screenings resulted in the detention of 797 parcels which, if found in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, will be refused entry into the country and destroyed, the FDA added. Preliminary findings from these screening showed U.S. consumers had purchased certain unapproved drug products from abroad to treat depression, narcolepsy, high cholesterol, glaucoma, and asthma, among other conditions.

2020-01-29 18:15:30,2020,1.0,29,Facebook to Pay $550 Million to Settle Facial Recognition Suit,"It was another black mark on the privacy record of the social network, which also reported its quarterly earnings. Facebook said on Wednesday that it had agreed to pay $550 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over its use of facial recognition technology in Illinois, giving privacy groups a major victory that again raised questions about the social network’s data-mining practices. The case stemmed from Facebook’s photo-labeling service, Tag Suggestions, which uses face-matching software to suggest the names of people in users’ photos. The suit said the Silicon Valley company violated an Illinois biometric privacy law by harvesting facial data for Tag Suggestions from the photos of millions of users in the state without their permission and without telling them how long the data would be kept. Facebook has said the allegations have no merit. Under the agreement, Facebook will pay $550 million to eligible Illinois users and for the plaintiffs’ legal fees. The sum dwarfs the $380.5 million that the Equifax credit reporting agency agreed this month to pay to settle a class-action case over a 2017 consumer data breach. Facebook disclosed the settlement as part of its quarterly financial results, in which it took a charge on the case. The sum amounted to a rounding error for Facebook, which reported that revenue rose 25 percent to $21 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with a year earlier, while profit increased 7 percent to $7.3 billion. David Wehner, Facebook’s chief financial officer, noted in an earnings call with investors that the settlement added to the social network’s rising general and administrative costs, which increased 87 percent from a year ago. “We decided to pursue a settlement as it was in the best interest of our community and our shareholders to move past this matter,” a Facebook spokesman said in a statement. Jay Edelson, a lawyer whose firm represented Facebook users in the facial recognition suit, said the settlement underscored the importance of strong privacy legislation. “From people who are passionate about gun rights to those who care about women’s reproductive issues, the right to participate in society anonymously is something that we cannot afford to lose,” Mr. Edelson said. The privacy settlement coincides with heightened public concern over the spread of powerful surveillance technology like facial recognition. Companies like Amazon and Clearview AI are marketing face-matching software to law enforcement agencies to help them identify unknown suspects. The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups have warned that the spread of such services could end people’s ability to remain anonymous in public. The case also illustrates the protections that strong state laws may offer consumers. Of the three states that have stand-alone biometric privacy laws, Illinois has the most comprehensive one. It requires companies to obtain written permission before collecting a person’s fingerprints, facial scans or other identifying biological characteristics. The law also gives residents the right to sue companies for up to $5,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars in payouts for tech giants that lose such class-action suits. “The Illinois law has real teeth. It pretty much stopped Facebook in its tracks,” said Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit group that filed a brief in the Facebook case. “Tech firms and other companies that collect biometric data must be very nervous right now.” Since the Illinois law was enacted in 2008, it has vexed companies that market voice assistants, doorbell cameras, photo labeling and other technology that may collect biometric details from people without their knowledge or consent. Many of the companies have argued that people should not be able to sue over violations of a consumer privacy law if they cannot prove they suffered concrete harms like financial losses. Facebook made similar claims in the facial recognition lawsuit, including in a petition in December asking the United States Supreme Court to review the case. The Supreme Court last week denied Facebook’s appeal. But last January, in a case against an amusement park that had collected and stored a child’s fingerprints, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that violating a person’s biometric privacy could constitute a harm in and of itself, enabling consumers to pursue privacy claims. An appeals court judge later issued a similar ruling in the Facebook case, denying the company’s bid to have the lawsuit dismissed. “Courts have recognized that the very loss of control over this highly sensitive, highly personal information itself causes harm to people,” said Nathan Wessler, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, which also filed a brief in the Facebook case. Facebook has been dogged by complaints over its use of facial recognition since 2010, when it rolled out Tag Suggestions as the default option for users. People could turn it off, but privacy experts said the company had neither obtained users’ opt-in consent for the technology nor explicitly informed them that it could benefit by, for instance, using scans of their photos to improve its face-matching technology. In 2012, Facebook deactivated the technology in Europe after regulators there raised questions about its consent system. Last year, as part of a $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations, Facebook agreed to provide “clear and conspicuous notice” about its face-matching software and obtain additional permission from people before using it for new purposes they had not agreed to. In 2018, Facebook reintroduced facial recognition as an option for users in Europe. Last year, Facebook updated its facial recognition notices and settings for certain users, providing more details on how it uses the technology.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/technology/29Facebook-privacy-lawsuit-earnings.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,929
2019-09-19 18:44:00,2019,9.0,19,"New, Dire Climate Models Say the Planet Warms Faster Than We Thought"," Two new climate models predict that global warming due to climate change will be faster and more severe than previously thought, meaning humanity will have to work even harder to curb its emissions and meet the warming goals set out in the Paris agreement. If we continue to use fossil fuels to drive rapid economic growth, the new models say, mean global temperature could rise as much as 7 degrees Celsius by 2100, which is 1 degree higher than previous estimates. In terms of climate change, that’s a lot. “It is difficult to imagine the impacts of that level of warming,” Olivier Boucher, head of the Climate Modeling Center at the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace in Paris, said in an email. “But there would be dramatic for many natural and human systems. As a comparison, the difference between an ice age and interglacial period is 5 [degrees Celsius].” These models came out of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, part of the World Climate Research Program, and were unveiled at a press conference on Tuesday. The models will be factored in to future Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports in 2021. Currently, the Paris Agreement—which is based on older climate models—wants to cap warming at 2 degrees Celsius. French scientists from multiple research institutions sorted through a massive amount of data, racking up around 500 million computing hours. The models they came up with predict that the climate will respond faster and more easily to our greenhouse gas emissions than previously assumed. This increase in expected climate response, called “equilibrium climate sensitivity,” means that humanity will need to curb its emissions even more drastically to satisfy the Paris agreement This research is the latest in a series of new models being created worldwide to better understand our changing climate. The work wasn’t done exclusively by climate scientists. Nearly 100 scientists from numerous disciplines participated in the work, including climatologists, oceanographers, glaciologists, and other specialists. In addition to global climate patterns, the new research zeroes in on some more local phenomenon (such as heat waves and tropical storms), simulating them more realistically than ever before. The impacts of the worst-case scenario under the new models (a 7 degree Celsius warming by 2100) are severe, and will likely require more research to accurately predict. But it is estimated that, at about half of that warming, most species would not survive and all summer Arctic ice would disappear. The countries who signed the Paris agreement pledged to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, a far cry from the worst-case scenario. Even 2 degrees warming above pre-industrial levels will have severe consequences for sea level rise, heat waves, ice melt, and extreme weather events. We haven’t even hit one degree of warming yet, and are already facing record heat waves, intense wildfires, and rapidly melting ice. In these new models, there is only one socio-economic scenario that limits warming to 2 degrees, and it requires strong international cooperation and investment in sustainable development. Even then, the scenario calls for extreme mitigation efforts, and we will still likely exceed the target at some point in the next century, warming over 2 degrees before cooling down only if drastic geoengineering measures are taken. ""We have to do both adaptation for the warming to be expected, and as much mitigation as possible to be on the best possible path,"" Boucher said. In a time when international cooperation is paramount to fighting climate change, Trump is still attempting to pull out of the Paris agreement as soon as he’s able (in November 2020), despite pushback from Congress. The Paris agreement, which already lacks real regulatory teeth, will need to be strengthened and redefined if we want to avoid more extreme warming scenarios. And then, we actually have to follow through. ",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywabb5/new-dire-climate-models-say-the-planet-warms-faster-than-we-thought,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,633

2019-07-19 00:00:00,2019,7.0,19,Republican lawmakers urge Trump not to delay Pentagon cloud contract,"A group of Republican lawmakers wrote a letter Thursday asking President Donald Trump not to delay the awarding of a Pentagon cloud contract. Trump said Thursday he would ""look very closely"" at the contract, which is believed to be worth up to $10 billion and is expected to be awarded to either Microsoft or Amazon. Four members of the House Armed Services Committee, including ranking member Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, said moving forward with the contract was critical to U.S. national security interests. ""We believe it is essential for our national security to move forward as quickly as possible with the award and implementation of this contract,"" according to the letter, which was sent on Thursday. ""It meets only a portion of the Department of Defense's needs for the cloud, but it is an important first step."" ""Moving to the cloud will help DOD operate faster, more efficiently, and compete with adversaries, like China,"" the letter said. In April, IBM and Oracle were ruled out for the cloud-computing contract, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, leaving Amazon and Microsoft as the only remaining competitors for the contract. The companies have been competing head-to-head to win the contract as they work to expand their respective cloud businesses. The DOD was supposed to award a recipient of the contract in September 2018. The contract is now expected to be awarded as soon as next month, the Pentagon told CNBC. Trump said he would examine the JEDI contract after receiving complaints from other companies, including Microsoft, Oracle and IBM. Trump has previously sparred with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos over a number of issues, notably his ownership of The Washington Post, which Trump criticizes for its coverage of his administration. ""We're getting tremendous complaints from other companies,"" Trump said in a press pool at the White House during a meeting with the prime minister of the Netherlands on Thursday. ""Some of the greatest companies in the world are complaining about it."" In the letter, Thornberry and Reps. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y.; Michael Turner, R-Ohio, and Robert Wittman, R-Va., said they've overseen the contract's handling ""from the beginning."" ""As you know, the courts have upheld DOD's handling of the competition,"" the letter said. ""While it is understandable that some of the companies competing for the contract are disappointed at not being selected as one of the finalists, further unnecessary delays will only damage our security and increase the costs of the contract.""

2019-06-12 18:39:02,2019,6.0,12,Huawei Is Said to Demand Patent Fees From Verizon,"President Trump’s dispute with China has landed on the doorstep of Verizon, with Huawei demanding that the American wireless giant pay licensing fees on hundreds of patents, according to two people briefed on the matter. Huawei, one of China’s largest technology companies and the world’s biggest supplier of networking equipment, accused Verizon in a letter this spring of violating 238 of its patents, the people said. They would speak only on the condition of anonymity because the issue was considered a potential legal dispute. The letter, earlier reported in The Wall Street Journal, represents a new wrinkle in the tensions between the Trump administration and China. Mr. Trump has appeared to use Huawei as a bargaining chip in his trade war with China. Last month, he signed an executive order that banned the purchase of equipment from companies posing a national security threat. That includes gear from Huawei, because of its ties to the Chinese government. Huawei officials have denied that it is a security risk and has accused the Trump administration of unfairly targeting the company’s products. In the letter, dated March 29, Huawei wrote to Verizon that “we trust you will see the benefits to taking a license to our patent portfolio,” according to one of the people briefed on the matter. The two companies have exchanged several emails and phone calls since and met as recently as last week in New York to discuss Huawei’s claims. Licenses can be paid on a per-subscriber basis, typically as a percentage of certain sales. Huawei has been shut out of the American smartphone market for years, and the patent claim is a way for the Chinese tech giant to try to extract some revenue from American companies, the two people familiar with the letter said. Verizon doesn’t buy any Huawei products but relies on over 20 vendors that use technology owned by the Chinese telecommunications giant. Huawei’s patent claim covers a variety of properties, including networking devices and wireless technology. Added up, Huawei’s claims would exceed $1 billion in fees, the people said. A spokesman for Verizon, Richard Young, said the company had no comment on the letter. But, he said, “these issues are larger than just Verizon.” Mr. Young added, “Given the broader geopolitical context, any issue involving Huawei has implications for our entire industry and also raise national and international concerns.” Huawei did not respond to a request for comment. The company, in addition to its popular networking equipment, supplies smartphones to 170 nations. The company has become a totem of China’s recent technological prowess. But the recent executive order from Mr. Trump effectively crippled Huawei on a number of fronts, because it prevents American businesses from selling software or hardware components to the company. Huawei’s smartphones, for example, rely on Google’s Android operating system. A few weeks later, Beijing hit back. It warned executives at American tech giants such as Microsoft and Dell that they faced retribution if they cooperated with the Trump administration’s ban on sales of American technology to Chinese companies. Huawei has mounted a legal challenge to American limits on purchases of its equipment, suing the federal government, saying it had been unfairly and incorrectly banned as a security threat. Huawei’s chief legal officer, Song Liuping, laid out the company’s position for the motion in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal in May. Around that time, Mr. Song added to the company’s argument at a news conference at its headquarters in Shenzhen. “The U.S. government has provided no evidence to show that Huawei is a security threat,” he said. “There is no gun, no smoke. Only speculation.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/technology/huawei-verizon-patent-license-fees.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,604
2019-09-19 00:00:00,2019,9.0,19,Tencent Music and WeSing: No hurry to take karaoke app to more markets,"Tencent Music Entertainment is in no hurry to bring its popular social karaoke app to more international markets just yet, according to a senior executive at the company. Besides China, the app, called WeSing, is available in the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia. Before going into more markets, Tencent Music wants to see more ""sustainable"" success for the app in those countries, Dennis Hau, group vice president at Tencent Music Entertainment, told CNBC on Tuesday. ""I'm a products guy. I really want a product to be sustainable, to be not just popular, but also be able to retain users on an ongoing basis before we expand further,"" Hau said. That, according to the executive, is going to be very costly, but if WeSing is able to perform as the company hopes in markets such as the Philippines or Indonesia, then ""we have more confidence, then we can push out to more ... countries."" WeSing lets people upload their performances online and interact with others on the platform. Tencent Music claims its users create 10 million recordings per day. An artificial intelligence program parses those files to find talented amateur performers. Tencent Music makes money on WeSing when users buy virtual ""gifts"" for their favorite performers. The decision to enter the four Southeast Asia markets was based on demographic research, marketing data and ""gut-feeling,"" Hau said. He said that people in those countries love music and are generally very sociable. ""We also look at the market size,"" Hau added. ""At the end of the day, we're wanting business there."" Southeast Asia has a population of 650 million people. Tencent's music business is split into music streaming and social entertainment services like WeSing. QQ Music, which is Tencent's online music streaming service, is popular in China. The company claims 800 million registered users for the service since its 2005 launch. That figure would almost equal the Chinese government's estimate for China's entire internet population. Asked to elaborate on the 800 million number, Tencent Music told CNBC that some individual users may have ""unintentionally created multiple accounts"" after losing mobile numbers or through different social media apps. The company's social entertainment products include not only karaoke platform WeSing, but also live streaming services Kugou Live and Kuwo Live, which let users watch live performances and concerts. Those platforms generate more revenue for the tech giant than online music streaming. In August, Tencent Music Entertainment reported quarterly revenue of 5.9 billion yuan ($832.4 million), short of a consensus estimate of 5.953 billion yuan ($840 million) from Refinitiv for the April-June quarter. The firm also reported its average revenue per paying user for its social entertainment services was 130.2 yuan ($18.37), a 16.5% on-year jump, but it was said to be the slowest growth pace since Tencent Music Entertainment went public last December. Average revenue per paying user is a closely-watched metric for media streaming companies. Also in August, Bloomberg News reported that China's antitrust authority was scrutinizing Tencent Music Entertainment's dealings with music labels including Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group. Those record labels were said to have sold exclusive rights to a large portion of their music catalogs to Tencent Music, which then sub-licenses that music to smaller rivals, a practice they complain is unfair, Bloomberg reported. Tencent Music declined to comment on antitrust laws or the ongoing investigation. The company's competitors in China include music and video platforms operated by Alibaba, Baidu, NetEase, and ByteDance. — Reuters contributed to this report.

2020-03-23 00:00:00,2020,3.0,23,Dock workers at Brazil's Santos port call off strike vote,"SAO PAULO, March 23 (Reuters) - A union representing the on-demand dock workers has called off a vote that had been scheduled for Monday on whether to hold a strike at Latin America’s largest port over concerns about risks from the coronavirus outbreak. In a statement on Sunday, the union - which said it represents about 5,000 people - said the cancellation of the vote was due to a request from government officials. The statement did not set a new date for the vote. While the vote was suspended, the union called on the government to pass measures guaranteeing compensation for the workers during the coronavirus crisis. The union is also demanding additional health protections. Sopesp, an association representing port operators in the state of São Paulo, said on Monday operations remained normal at the port, where most of Brazil’s soybeans, corn, cotton, and coffee are exported to world markets. Port operators have been reducing their reliance on the autonomous workers represented by the union, according to Santos port authority Codesp. On Friday, Codesp declined to comment on the impact of any labor action at Santos port. Reporting by Ana Mano

2019-09-09 00:00:00,2019,9.0,9,UK fears crisis as 11.5 million get potentially addictive drugs,"LONDON (Reuters) - More and more Britons are being prescribed potentially addictive medicines including sleeping pills, opioids and other painkillers, raising the risk of a drug crisis like the one in the United States, health officials said on Tuesday. In a government-commissioned report, researchers at Public Health England (PHE) said evidence showed that “since at least 10 years ago more people are being prescribed more of these medicines and often for longer”. In 2017 to 2018 alone, 11.5 million adults in England - more than a quarter of the adult population - was prescribed one or more of the medicines under review, the PHE analysis found. The medicines included anti-anxiety drugs called benzodiazepines and sleeping pills known as z-drugs, as well as the epilepsy and anxiety medicines gabapentin and pregabalin, antidepressants and opioid pain medicines. Many of these can be addictive and could cause problems for people taking them or coming off them, PHE said. The report also found higher rates of prescribing to women and older people. While the prescription of some drugs, including benzodiazepines and opioids, has dipped a little recently amid fears about the deadly opioid epidemic in the United States, others, such as the gabapentin, pregabalin and some antidepressants, are being prescribed more often and for longer. “This means more people are at risk of becoming addicted to them or having problems when they stop using them,” PHE said. “It also costs the National Health Service a lot of money, some of which is wasted because the medicines do not work for everyone all the time, especially if they are used for too long.” Responding to the PHE’s findings, the British Medical Association (BMA) doctors union said its members were worried: “We have seen the devastation that addiction to prescription drugs has had in the United States, and while the problem here is on a lesser scale, doctors ... are concerned at the number of patients being prescribed these medicines, and the length of time they are taking them for,” it said in a statement. An opioid epidemic in the United States has killed almost half a million Americans since 1999, and a report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) policy forum earlier this year warned that the United States “is by no means alone in facing this crisis.” The Paris-based OECD said deaths linked to opioid use were rising sharply in Sweden, Norway, Ireland, and England and Wales. Campaigners at the UK Addiction Treatment Group (UKAT) said the PHE report showed “a nation crying out for help” and being put on potentially dangerous repeat courses of painkillers and antidepressants as a stop-gap measure. UKAT said the consequences of such prescribing were already in evidence with rising numbers of people seeking treatment for prescription drug addiction. Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said it was watching the U.S. crisis closely and aiming to take avoiding action in the UK. “We take the experience in the U.S. of dependence and addiction to opioids very seriously and are following ... developments ... to learn from the actions other countries are taking to tackle this issue,” it said in a statement.

2019-09-11 00:00:00,2019,9.0,11,Libra Association to apply for payments license in Switzerland,"The Libra Association, the organization in charge of overseeing Facebook's proposed cryptocurrency, said Wednesday it will apply for a payments license in Switzerland. The Geneva-based non-profit said in a press release it had submitted a request to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) to clarify how the libra coin will be regulated under Swiss rules. FINMA confirmed Wednesday it had received the Libra Association's request. The news indicates the Libra Association is doubling down on its decision to make Switzerland its main supervisory authority, despite some pushback from U.S. lawmakers and regulators. ""The choice of Switzerland as the home for the newly established Libra Association, which when fully developed will have a diverse group of member organizations spanning technology, financial services, social impact organizations and venture capital, among others, harnesses Switzerland's role as a nucleus for international organizations,"" the Libra Association said in the press release. The Libra Association is an independent nonprofit tasked with overseeing the proposed digital currency called libra. Facebook, along with 27 other companies including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal, are founding members of the organization. The goal of the digital currency, Facebook says, is to provide a quick, low-cost way for people around the world to transfer money. Regulators have been highly skeptical of Libra, citing risks like money laundering, financial stability and terrorism financing. FINMA said Swiss payment systems are automatically subject to the ""highest international anti-money laundering standards."" ""Due to the issuance of Libra payment tokens, the services planned by the Libra project would clearly go beyond those of a pure payment system and therefore be subject to such additional requirements,"" FINMA said.

The second case was a five-year-old boy in Laguna, south of the capital Manila. The department announced on Thursday that a three-year-old girl had tested positive earlier this week in Lanao del Sur. The two provinces are about 1,400 km (870 miles) apart. Philippine officials on Friday said they were preparing to vaccinate millions of children against polio to halt an outbreak of a disease it believed to have been eradicated. It comes as the Philippines grapples to tackle twin outbreaks of dengue and measles that have killed more than 1,000 people since January, most of them children.

2019-12-31 00:00:00,2019,12.0,31,Microsoft wraps up its best year since 2009,"Microsoft just finished its best year in a decade — at least when it comes to stock price performance. Shares ended trading at $157.70 on Tuesday, extending its gains for 2019 to 55.3%, making this the stock's best year since 2009, when it rose 56.8%. Microsoft shares were up 417% higher for the decade — not quite the 9,562% gain of the 1990s, which saw the launch of Windows 95, but easily overshadowing the 2000s, when the company emerged from its major antitrust case. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 also jumped in the 2010s amid the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. The Nasdaq outperformed the other two indices with 295% growth. Microsoft didn't grow as much as some other S&P 500 constituents like Amazon, Broadcom and Netflix. Then again, Microsoft is worth more than all three of those companies, with a $1.20 trillion market capitalization. Only Apple and Saudi Aramco are worth more. This year Microsoft was a major contributor to the S&P 500's rise, second only to Apple. It contributed about 7% of the index's gains in 2019. The stock outcome reflects Microsoft's evolution. In the past 10 years the company underwent leadership changes and strategy shifts and pulled off its biggest acquisition yet. This year Microsoft has built on those transitions, and investors are expecting more growth as companies upgrade to the company's newest technology. And while regulators have looked afresh at Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Facebook in recent months, Microsoft has largely escaped their scrutiny this time around. Here are some of the highlights of 2019 that could set up Microsoft for future gains in the months and years ahead: Microsoft was the largest holding in investment bank William Blair's Large Cap Growth Fund at the end of the third quarter, at over 9%. The 20-year-old fund bought Microsoft stock after Nadella took over based on the company's potential in areas like cloud and artificial intelligence, Jim Golan, a portfolio manager of the fund, told CNBC in an interview in November. ""We've been very pleased with that investment,"" Golan said. ""I think just [Nadella] changing the mindset and refocusing the company on key core growth areas has been really instrumental in terms of driving the performance that we've seen over the past several years."" The adoption of cloud services will be a major driver for Microsoft in the future, and the company should be able to expand its margins as Azure gains scale, he said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/31/microsoft-wraps-up-its-best-year-since-2009.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,414
2017-04-14 00:00:00,2017,4.0,14,Mumps in Texas: Biggest outbreak in 22 years," (CNN)The Texas Department of State Health Services warned this week of multiple ongoing mumps outbreaks. The surge, which includes 221 cases this year, constitutes the highest incidence of mumps in the state in 22 years.  Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus that spreads from person to person through saliva and mucus. ""What we've seen -- as in other parts of the country, (it's) really just the same thing -- a pretty big resurgence in mumps cases over the last six or eight months,"" said Chris Van Deusen, spokesman for the state's health services department. In 2016, Texas experienced 192 mumps cases, he said, primarily in the last few months of the year. Mumps typically begins with fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness and loss of appetite lasting a few days, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most people will have swelling of the salivary glands, causing puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw. Generally, symptoms last at least two days but no more than 10 days.  Because it is caused by a virus, mumps does not respond to antibiotics. Doctors generally recommend bed rest and over-the-counter pain relievers. ""We have largely seen outbreaks in North Texas, so the Dallas-Fort Worth area and some of the surrounding counties,"" Van Deusen said, adding that Dallas County has experienced two or three significant outbreaks.   ""We've had quite a large one with, counting last year and this year, more than 150 cases in Johnson County, which is just south of Fort Worth,"" he said. ""We've certainly seen cases in other areas of the state, but those have been where the largest outbreaks have been centered."" An outbreak in Johnson County, in particular, included 189 cases spanning last year and this year among children and a couple of college students, he said. ""There have been people who have traveled back and forth between (Johnson County) and Northwest Arkansas, where they've been seeing much of the activity, so it seems to be linked to that outbreak,"" Van Deusen said. An outbreak of mumps began in Arkansas in August, explained Dr. Dirk Haselow, Arkansas' state epidemiologist. Between August and April 13, Arkansas reported 2,930 cases, he said. (Similarly, Washington state (PDF) has been hard hit by the mumps, reporting 611 confirmed and probable cases during 2017.) ""We've had less than 500 cases this year,"" said Haselow, who believes his state is at the tail end of its outbreak. ""Thankfully, the number of cases we've had each week decreased recently. We've only added 14 cases in the last three weeks."" At the height of the outbreak, nearly 50 cases a day were reported across 35 counties. Today, only four counties are experiencing infections.  As for a possible spread from his state to Texas, Haselow has no doubts.   ""Mumps has a long incubation period, as long as 26 days between exposure and symptoms, so people could have been exposed, you know, a little over a month ago, and now you have new cases with that association,"" he said.   Across the nation, most mumps cases are occurring among people who have been vaccinated, according to the CDC, and these outbreaks are not due to low vaccination rates. For example, in Texas, 97.6% of kindergarten-age children have received two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, Van Deusen said, while 98.7% of seventh-graders have. The CDC recommends that children get two doses of the MMR vaccine. One dose is considered about 78% effective initially (PDF), and two doses are about 88% effective. So even if you are vaccinated, you need to practice primary prevention. ""Obviously, one of the things you do is avoid people with mumps,"" said Infectious disease specialist Dr. William Schaffner, but he noted that this practice is limited in its ability to ward off the mumps for two reasons.  ""People can actually spread the mumps virus for several days before they become sick,"" he said. The second reason: Mumps also causes subclinical infections.  ""That is, I can get infected, but I don't get sick. Still, I'm capable of passing it on to someone else,"" Schaffner said. ""That's a big problem."" Mumps can cause complications, especially in adults. These include deafness and inflammation of the brain, ovaries, breast tissue or testicles. Occasionally, mumps can cause encephalitis, which in rare cases can lead to death, says the CDC. There's a safe way to prevent complications, Schaffner says: the MMR vaccine. ""We say that the vaccine, after 15 years, is about 85% effective,"" he said. So the bad news is that 15% of people who have been vaccinated are likely to become ill if they encounter mumps very closely.  ""However, the good news is, the complications of mumps seem not to develop,"" Schaffner said. People who have been vaccinated are unlikely to get meningitis or inflammation of the ovaries or testes, or partial deafness. ""It would appear these complications are not occurring among these individuals who have partial immunity. They get a milder infection."" Those who favor pre-emptive strikes might consider an updated vaccine, he said.  ""Should everyone traveling to Texas get another dose of MMR? We're not there yet,"" Schaffner said, adding that the CDC is not recommending such measures.  Still, if you're visiting family in Texas and know that they have the mumps, you might go to your doctor beforehand and request a dose of MMR, he suggested.  ""You may have to pay for it out of pocket,"" he said. ""How much protection it gives me, I don't know, but it is a safe and easy thing to do.""  Each year, the number of mumps cases fluctuates within a range of a couple hundred to a couple thousand cases, according to the CDC. In 2016, 5,311 cases were reported in 46 states and the District of Columbia. ",https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/14/health/mumps-texas/index.html,health,CNN,health,961
2018-03-25 22:47:06,2018,3.0,25,"Uber to Sell Its Southeast Asia Business to Grab, a Regional Rival","Uber, which for years spread across the globe with command-and-conquer rapaciousness, is pulling back from another major ride-hailing market. The company said on Sunday that it would sell its Southeast Asia ride and food-delivery businesses to Grab, a rival based in Singapore, in the latest move to shore up its finances and refocus its business ahead of a planned public listing. Uber will get a 27.5 percent stake in Grab in exchange. Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, will join Grab’s board. Further financial terms were not disclosed. The détente in Southeast Asia, which is similar to deals Uber has made in China and Russia in recent years, comes at a time of larger changes at the company, based in San Francisco. SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that recently took a big stake in Uber, has also backed a host of its competitors, including Grab in Southeast Asia, Ola in India and Didi Chuxing, which bought Uber’s China business in 2016. That means SoftBank would rather these companies did not spend too much money competing against one another. Uber’s exit from Southeast Asia, a region of more than 600 million people, also reflects the new direction the company is taking under Mr. Khosrowshahi, who replaced Travis Kalanick as chief executive last year. Mr. Khosrowshahi has forsworn his predecessor’s infamously pugnacious way of doing business. And with a mandate to take Uber public, he has set out to repair relations with regulators, fix a troubled workplace culture and calm Wall Street about the company’s financial prospects. Uber said it lost $1.1 billion in the last three months of 2017, somewhat less than it lost in the preceding quarter. “It is fair to ask whether consolidation is now the strategy of the day,” Mr. Khosrowshahi wrote in an email to staff. “The answer is no.” He continued: “One of the potential dangers of our global strategy is that we take on too many battles across too many fronts and with too many competitors. This transaction now puts us in a position to compete with real focus and weight in the core markets where we operate.” Grab was introduced in 2012 and now operates in eight Southeast Asian countries: Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. And it has put up a tough fight. With passengers in nearly 200 cities across the region, the company is aiming to be more than just a transportation provider. It wants its digital wallet, GrabPay, to replace cash as a way to pay for things at offline shops and restaurants. And in a region where many people lack credit histories or even bank accounts, Grab is undertaking a venture to make loans to consumers and small businesses. Data collected through Grab’s app, on users’ movements and transactions, is used to assess their creditworthiness. Grab also offers a wide variety of ways for people to get around. In Singapore, you can hop on a GrabShuttle that, like a public bus, will take you between points along a fixed route. In jam-packed Jakarta, you can use Grab’s app to hail a nearby motorbike taxi right off the street, forgoing the usual process of prebooking and waiting for the driver to arrive at your location. The company is generally regarded as the market leader in Southeast Asia. But in Indonesia, the region’s most populous country, it is taking on Go-Jek, a local rival whose apps offer services, such as massages on demand and motorbike parcel deliveries, that go beyond just rides. Go-Jek’s investors include Google and Tencent, the Chinese internet conglomerate. In an interview, Ming Maa, Grab’s president, said that the deal with Uber would help Grab move closer to profitability, although he declined to give specifics. One key benefit of combining with Uber, Mr. Maa said, is that it immediately expands Grab’s food-delivery operations. “That has massive, massive benefits to our consumer base,” he said, “but is also a key driver for our mobile payments business.” For Uber, ceding Southeast Asia still leaves it with plenty of challengers elsewhere in the world. Didi Chuxing, based in Beijing, invested alongside SoftBank in Grab last year. It recently raised money from SoftBank and other investors at a valuation of $56 billion — higher than the $48 billion at which Uber was valued as part of last year’s stake sale to SoftBank. Now, Didi wants to go global. The company, whose full name is pronounced “dee-dee choo-SHING,” recently took control of 99, an Uber rival in Brazil, and is recruiting on LinkedIn ahead of a planned opening in Mexico. Didi is also aiming to expand soon into Japan — a market in which Uber, too, will make a big push this year, according to Mr. Khosrowshahi. SoftBank, despite being an investor in both Uber and Didi, announced recently that it would partner with Didi in Japan.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/technology/uber-grab-southeast-asia.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,805

Despite the early win, the two partners said on Tuesday they did not expect to launch roxadustat in China until the second half of 2019. FibroGen sponsored the development and registration of roxadustat in China, while AstraZeneca is responsible for marketing the medicine. The companies had previously said they hoped for Chinese approval before the end of 2018. The upcoming launch will help consolidate AstraZeneca’s position in China, where it has more than doubled sales since 2012. Today, China generates nearly a fifth of the drugmaker’s global revenue, a far higher proportion than for rivals. Roxadustat is the first of a new kind of oral anaemia treatment called a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor that boosts production of red blood cells by mimicking the body’s response to high altitude. The approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration clears its use in patients with anaemia caused by chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are on dialysis. Anaemia becomes increasingly common among individuals with CKD as the disease progresses. The new pill is seen as a more convenient alternative to EPO, or erythropoietin, a class of injectable blood enhancers that have been under a cloud for some years due to cardiovascular safety concerns.

Timothy Livingston, 31, entered his plea in federal court in Newark, New Jersey to three counts including conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers and access devices, prosecutors said. His plea came ahead of a trial scheduled for Nov. 14, and followed guilty pleas in June by two other men in the case, Tomasz Chmielarz of Rutherford, New Jersey and Devin McArthur of Ellicott City, Maryland. As part of a plea agreement, Livingston agreed to forfeit nearly $1.35 million as well as property he obtained using proceeds from the scheme, including a Ferrari and Cadillac, prosecutors said. He is scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 27. A lawyer for Livingston did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Prosecutors said Livingston, who owned a spam company called A Whole Lot of Nothing LLC, solicited Chmielarz to write computer programs that send spam in a manner that conceals their origin and bypasses spam filters. In pleading guilty, Livingston admitted that he also hacked into individual email accounts and used corporate mail servers to further his spam campaigns, prosecutors said. He also admitted he and Chmielarz created custom software that appropriated a corporate website belonging to a New York-based technology company in order to use its servers to send spam that appeared to be from the company, prosecutors said.

Venezuela's deaths come as other Latin American nations battle the virus. Zika is also commanding attention because of an alarming connection between the virus and microcephaly, a neurological disorder in which babies are born with abnormally small heads. It causes severe developmental issues and in some cases, death.  The Zika virus is a flavivirus, part of the same family as yellow fever, West Nile and dengue. But unlike some of those viruses, there is no vaccine to prevent Zika and no medicine to treat the infection.  Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first case of locally acquired Zika virus in the United States in the latest outbreak. The case was transmitted via sex, and not by the most common route, which is via mosquito bite. Brazil has reported the most cases in the outbreak, sparking major concern because the nation is hosting the Olympics in August.  The World Health Organization has declared the spike in microcephaly cases a global health emergency. Other nations affected include Colombia and El Salvador.  Adult deaths unclear  The WHO said it has not seen adult deaths due to the Zika virus, adding that the world health agency is awaiting more information on the Venezuela deaths. Brazil also reported three deaths from the virus, but experts say more research is needed on those cases as well.  ""We have not seen reports of deaths of adults directly linked to the viral infection,"" said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, the WHO assistant director-general for health systems and innovation.  ""It could be that this was Guillain-Barre in persons known to be infected with Zika virus, but this will need to be confirmed. We have had no direct primary information from Venezuela on that yet.""  The link between Zika virus and Guillain-Barre is highly probable, according to Kieny. Areas  where there is an increased prevalence of Zika have also seen an increase in cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome. ""The direct causality is still to be demonstrated but the association in time and location seems to be clear. We have a few more weeks to be sure to demonstrate the causality, but the link between Zika and Guillain-Barre is highly probable,"" Kieny said.  Guillain-Barre is a rare autoimmune disorder that can lead to life-threatening paralysis. Vaccines in the works   The WHO has said that vaccines to fight the Zika virus are at least 18 months away from large scale trials.  Many companies have been identified, but most have just begun working on a vaccine, according to Kieny.  ""The landscape is evolving very rapidly and numbers change daily,"" she said. ""About 15 companies have been identified by the WHO so far, and most only just started work. Two vaccines candidates seem to be more advanced.""  CNN's  Radina Gigova, Marilia Brocchetto and Michael Roa contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2016/02/12/health/venezuela-ziva-virus-venezeuela/index.html,health,CNN,health,504

The game, which marries a classic 20-year old franchise with augmented reality, has taken the world by storm despite having been launched in only five countries — the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Britain and Germany. ""Why limit it?"" John Hanke, chief executive of Niantic, which developed Pokemon Go jointly with Nintendo affiliate Pokemon Company, said in an interview with Reuters on Friday. He declined to go into a detailed time frame for further rollouts but noted that the company's first location-based augmented reality game Ingress had taken a month or two to reach that number of markets. His comments helped Nintendo shares on Friday surge another 10 percent, setting a record in daily trading volume for an individual stock on the Tokyo bourse. The shares have climbed 86 percent in just over a week, adding $17 billion in market value. He confirmed that the game would soon be coming to Japan and that he expects ""ultimately to launch"" the game in South Korea, where Google's mapping functions are restricted due to security issues with North Korea. Hanke said Niantic, which was spun off from Google last year, is working on the mapping issue. ""There are solutions to that,"" he said. South Korea is the world's fourth-biggest gaming market after China, the United States and Japan, according to Amsterdam-based research firm Newzoo. But he was more reticent about prospects for a launch in China, saying only that there are regulations that have to be considered. Hanke said the company is considering introducing a sponsorship scheme similar to one it has with Ingress, which designates sponsors' stores and vending machines as spots in the game. Sponsors pay per customer visit, providing a revenue stream in addition to in-app purchases. Niantic currently has eight corporate sponsors for Ingress globally, including SoftBank Group, and the number is likely to be similar for Pokemon Go, he said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/15/developer-of-nintendos-pokemon-go-aiming-for-rollout-to-200-markets-soon.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,351
2019-06-07 00:00:00,2019,6.0,7,"How Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple faced EU tech antitrust rules","Europe has made its name as the top cop of tech regulation. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, has imposed a combined $9.5 billion in antitrust fines against Google since 2017, and its boss hints Amazon and Apple might be next in line. Facebook, meanwhile, has been subject to probes from competition and data protection authorities across the EU since the region's strict new set of privacy rules called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect last year. As U.S. regulators and lawmakers step up their efforts to reign in big tech companies, Europe offers some valuable lessons. ""You've seen a lot of proxy wars go on here because of the nature of the fact that we've got one Europe-wide regulator for antitrust, and the laws are clear, and that regulator definitely has teeth,"" Mark MacGann, Uber's former head of public policy in Europe and founder of venture capital and advisory firm Moonshot Ventures, told CNBC in an interview. When it comes to enforcement, the European Commission has opted for fines and mandates for tech companies to their change in business practices, rather than arguing to break them up, said John Cassels, a partner who specializes in competition law at European firm Fieldfisher, in an interview. This tactic could put Europe's approach at odds with some U.S. lawmakers touting strong rhetoric about dismantling big tech companies. The EU's fines have done little to dent any tech companies' profits. ""The Commission looked like it was going to go as far as some sort of break-up but actually it's sort of shied away from that recently,"" Cassels said. Here's how Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have fared among EU regulators so far. Alphabet subsidiary Google has faced the toughest antitrust action. In March, the European Commission levied a $1.7 billion fine on the tech giant for abusing its dominance in the online advertising market, citing ""illegal"" practices of restricting competitors' ads in search results. Google said this week it is appealing. The fine marked the third consecutive year of antitrust rulings on Google from the EU. In 2018, the regulator charged Google with a record $5.1 billion fine for anti-competitive practices on its Android devices, saying the company had forced device makers to pre-install its own apps. Analysts at Evercore ISI wrote in note last week they expect the U.S. Department of Justice could take cues from this specific case, which forced Google to offer browser and search-app alternatives on Android devices. ""We believe this could be an area where US investigators take a much closer look then previously, given the now far greater importance of the mobile ecosystem vs 2011,"" the Evercore analysts wrote. The European Commission first went after Google in 2017 with a $2.7 billion fine for abusing its dominance as a search engine. The EU accused Google of favoring its own comparison shopping service over competitors' in search results. Legal experts said the 2017 findings, which were released after a nearly seven-year investigation, could also serve as a guide for antitrust action in the U.S. when it comes to Google's search practices. But they also cautioned it's easier to prove market dominance under EU legal standards than in the U.S. ""In the U.S. the thresholds are higher and the FTC and DOJ are sort of put to the test by courts,"" Fieldfisher's Cassels said. Facebook's EU headquarters is in Ireland, and the social media giant is facing several inquiries from the Data Protection Commission there. The complaints range from Facebook failing to provide access to personal data to how the company targets ads on its platform. ""You're going to see a lot of decisions over the coming months by national regulators in Europe especially in Ireland,"" MacGann said. Experts also point to the findings of a three-year long investigation of Facebook by Germany's antitrust watchdog, which could serve as a guide for a possible FTC investigation because it tackles both data collection and monopoly concerns. In February, the German regulator found Facebook had abused its market dominance in the way it collects, merges and uses user data across its platforms, including WhatsApp and Instagram. It ordered the company to stop merging data on separate apps without users' deliberate consent. Facebook appealed the order. Germany's antitrust watchdog is also investigating Amazon. At stake is whether the retail giant prevents fair competition in its online marketplace in the country. The regulator cited ""numerous complaints"" it had received from sellers about Amazon's business practices. Amazon's role in e-commerce has prompted recent probes by national competition authorities in Austria and Italy, too. In the case of Italy, regulators singled out Amazon's practices in both online retailing and logistics. Amazon has said it is fully cooperating with authorities. Meanwhile Margrethe Vestager, the head of competition policy in Europe, told CNBC in April the EU's investigation of Amazon is in an ""advanced"" stage. The European Commission is examining whether Amazon is taking advantage of merchants' data. Each morning, the “Beyond the Valley” newsletter brings you all the latest from the vast, dynamic world of tech – outside the Silicon Valley. In March, Spotify filed a complaint against Apple with the European Commission, saying Apple's App Store fees put competitors at a disadvantage. The Stockholm-based music streaming company took issue with a 30% cut the iPhone maker takes from most in-app purchases made through the App Store. Apple says its fees are reasonable. Spotify's EU complaint mirrors a lawsuit filed in the U.S. this week by app developers arguing Apple has attained ""monopoly power"" through its App Store. The EU said it will assess Spotify's complaint through its standard procedures. But Vestager hasn't hesitated to take on Apple in the past, ordering the company to pay back Ireland $14.5 billion in taxes in 2016. Tech stocks have been under pressure since news broke of possible DOJ and FTC investigations, with shares of Google parent company Alphabet dropping roughly 5% and Facebook tumbling around 6% over the past five days.

Ned Lamont told CNBC on Tuesday he's concerned that the number of ventilators in the state wouldn't be enough to handle a dramatic surge in coronavirus cases. ""We have a long way to go there,"" Lamont said in a ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""We do have some capacity there at this point, but I am worried. If we cannot flatten that curve, as they say, we could be overwhelmed.""  Lamont said that is why social-distancing efforts are so critical. He said they are necessary to ensure a flattening of the curve — essentially trying to limit the surge of coronavirus cases. Lamont on Monday announced a joint agreement with fellow Democratic governors of New York and New Jersey to limit density throughout the region, prohibiting crowds of 50 or more and closing restaurants and bars except for takeout and carryout orders.  The U.S. has more than 4,600 confirmed cases and 85 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data.  Lamont declared a state of emergency a week ago, when Connecticut had four confirmed cases. As of Tuesday morning, the state had 41 confirmed cases and no deaths. The governor said he was less worried about the number of hospital beds in Connecticut, saying the state could get creative to add capacity.  ""I think we could commandeer a lot of beds. We have our universities down right now. We have hotels that aren't fully occupied, so that's a little less urgent to me in terms of my priorities,"" he said. It gets more difficult to add ventilator capacity, he said, adding he's not counting on the federal government to supply the state with an appropriate amount.  ""You don't just go to Amazon to get a ventilator,"" Lamont said. ""I was on the phone for hours yesterday with hospitals, saying, 'This may be on us and we've got to take the lead on this. Where do you source this? What can I do to help?'"" During a video conference Monday, President Donald Trump reportedly told a group of governors they may have to obtain their own medical equipment that's in short supply as the nation faces an explosion of respiratory infections with the pandemic. ""Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment – try getting it yourselves,"" Trump told the governors, The New York Times reported, citing a recording of the conference call.",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/connecticut-gov-ned-lamont-on-beds-ventilators-for-coronavirus.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,389

The Football Association, Premier League, EFL and women’s professional game bodies, along with players and managers associations, agreed to extend the formal end-date for the 2019/2020 season in a bid to complete the campaign. “We are united in our commitment to finding ways of resuming the 2019/20 football season and ensuring all domestic and European club league and cup matches are played as soon as it is safe and possible to do so,” the organisations said following a video conference meeting on Thursday. Last week all elite soccer matches in England, including the Premier League, Football League (EFL) and Women’s Super League (WSL), were suspended until April 4. With non-league, youth and amateur football having also subsequently suspended play, the English game is in a state of total shutdown. European soccer’s governing body UEFA agreed on Tuesday to postpone Euro 2020 for a year, clearing space in the calendar for domestic competitions to finish — if the public health situation allows. FA rules say the season should end by June 1, but the decision was taken to extend that into the summer. “The progress of COVID-19 remains unclear and we can reassure everyone the health and welfare of players, staff and supporters are our priority,” the joint statement said. “We will continue to follow Government advice and work collaboratively to keep the situation under review and explore all options available to find ways of resuming the season when the conditions allow.” (Reporting by Simon Evans Editing by Toby Davis)",https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-soccer-england/update-1-soccer-premier-league-extends-shutdown-with-end-date-left-open-idUSL8N2BC69F,Healthcare,Reuters,health,293
2017-03-14 00:00:00,2017,3.0,14,Kesha talks at SXSW about Internet trolls,"It's necessary for artists to have a social media presence. But musician Kesha Sebert said online harassment has made it difficult. ""I use the Internet to connect with my fans, but besides that, It's not a really healthy place for me,"" Sebert, who is known as Kesha (formerly Ke$ha), said. Kesha spoke on a Refinery29 panel with chief content officer Amy Emmerich at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas on Tuesday. The singer, who has sold more than 2.47 million albums according to Billboard, was further thrust into the mainstream as a result of a high-profile lawsuit against producer Lukasz Gottwald, known as Dr. Luke. In 2014, Kesha sued Dr. Luke for alleged physical, sexual and emotional abuse and asked to get out of her music contract. Because of the ongoing case, she cannot release new music, but she said during the panel she has written between 70 to 80 songs, and hopes to release the music soon. The highly publicized case made her a target for online trolls. ""Criticism for me, it's been a long ride,"" Kesha said. ""It used to just tear me up inside, and then someone once told me something pretty profound: 'You're making people you don't know your higher power.' And then I realized I was. I was making trolls, making bullies, making people I had never met before -- because they were on the Internet, I was making them important.'"" When asked what advice she would give a 14-year-old who wanted to start an Instagram account, Kesha offered wisdom that any internet veteran would agree with: don't read the comments. ""I try to limit myself in terms of reading comments, because there could be a million positive ones but I hold on to the negative one."" Despite the downsides of social media, it can be used as a tool for good, added Kesha, who has also been a vocal advocate for LGBT and women's rights. ""There are a lot of positive things about social media,"" Kesha said. ""One positive thing is we can tell each other where to meet, and we can rally, and we can march. It's not that one person's voice is more important than everyone else. We're all equal.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/14/kesha-sxsw-internet-trolls.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,370

Indian drugmakers rely on China, the source of the virus outbreak, for almost 70% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for their medicines. Industry experts say they are likely to face shortages if the epidemic drags on. ""Export of specified APIs and formulations made from these APIs... is hereby 'restricted' with immediate effect and till further orders,"" the Director General of Foreign Trade said in a statement on Tuesday, without explaining the extent of the restrictions.

2016-01-27 17:50:00,2016,1.0,27,Judge in FBI Hacking Case Is Unclear on How FBI Hacking Works,"As criminals continue to protect themselves with encryption and anonymization tech, cops are moving to hacking as an investigatory tool. Over the years, the FBI in particular has launched several campaigns to obtain data from suspects' computers via malware, often using the term ""Network Investigative Technique"", or NIT, to describe the software being used. But a problem in some NIT cases is that judges have trouble understanding, even in general terms, what a hacking tool is, what they do, or how they work. To be clear, this isn't to place all blame on judges. Instead, it's arguably a problem stemming from how the Department of Justice and the FBI have framed and referred to NITs in legal documents, meaning that some judges may not fully realise the power and scope of the searches that they authorise. On Friday, a hearing was held in Seattle dealing with the case of Jay Michaud, a Vancouver, Washington public school administration worker arrested on child pornography charges last year. He was charged after FBI investigators seized Playpen, a Tor hidden service, and then hosted it from their own servers. From here, the FBI deployed a NIT designed to target users of the site and return their real IP address, amongst other technical information. During the hearing, Judge Robert. J Bryan seemed to not understand how a NIT, or, more broadly, a piece of information-siphoning malware works. This confusion, in part, arose from the language used in NIT warrants and supporting documents. The word ""hack,"" is never used, and neither is ""malware"" or ""exploit,"" for that matter. Instead, the procedure of malware being downloaded to a target's computer is largely obfuscated in vague terminology. ""In the normal course of operation, web sites send content to visitors,"" reads the application for a search warrant as part of Operation Torpedo, when a NIT was deployed on a number of hidden services in 2012. ""A user's computer downloads that content and uses it to display web pages on the user's computer. Under the NIT authorized by this warrant, the web site would augment that content with some additional computer instructions,"" it continues. This section also appeared in the Playpen NIT documentation, which Judge Bryan held particular issue with. ""You see, that is the kind of paragraph I don't understand fully,"" he said during the hearing, pointing to the line that describes how websites send content to visitors, according to a court transcript. ""And I am trying to understand."" A hangup also occurred around the misinterpretation of ""instructions""—Judge Bryan used the word in the context of a human following a list of instructions, but the warrant refers to computer code as instructions. Another exchange showed how it can be difficult for judge's to conceptualise where data obtained from malware is sourced from, and where it goes. ""Do the FBI experts have any way to look at the NIT information other than going to the server?"" Judge Bryan asked. ""Your Honor, they don't go to the server,"" Colin Fieman, a federal public defender who is representing Michaud, replied. ""Where do they go? How do they get the information?"" ""They get it from Mr. Michaud's computer."" ""They don't have his computer."" ""That's what the NIT is for,"" Fieman explained. This back and forth continues for several pages in the transcript, and testimony around the use of the NIT was also given by FBI Special Agent Daniel Alfin, who worked on identifying suspected Playpen users. In short, Judge Byran, despite hearing the views of those who took part in the investigation, and having read the briefs submitted by the defense and prosecution several times, could not fully grasp what the NIT was doing. ""If a smart federal judge still has trouble understanding after hours of expert testimony what is actually going on,"" then the average judge signing warrant applications has little hope of truly understanding what the FBI is proposing, Nate Wessler, staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), told Motherboard in a phone interview. (The ACLU has agreed to a protective order for the Michaud case, allowing it access to the sealed filings.) ""It appears in this case, and that's consistent with other cases we've seen elsewhere in the country involving use of malware, the government explanations and warrant applications are quite sparse, and do not fully explain to judges how these technologies works,"" Wessler added. As the hearing continued, Judge Byran said ""I suppose there is somebody sitting in a cubicle somewhere with a keyboard doing this stuff. I don't know that. It may be they seed the clouds, and the clouds rain information. I don't know."" There is also the issue of documents arguably not being entirely clear about where the actual search of a computer is going to take place. In previous warrants, including that of Operation Torpedo, investigators have written that the search will take place within the issuing district, ""and elsewhere."" In the Playpen case, however, that phrase has been omitted, leaving only the district in which the warrant was signed. ""This search happened on a computer located in Vancouver, Washington,"" Fieman said in the hearing, referring to his client's computer. ""The warrant on its face is limited to persons and property in the Eastern District of Virginia."" Keith Becker, an attorney from the Department of Justice, said in the hearing that the warrant ""clearly requested the authorities to deploy to computers wherever located."" Magistrate Judge Theresa C. Buchanan in the Eastern District of Virginia, who signed the NIT warrant for the Playpen case, was not available for comment. ""Judge Buchanan does not respond to media inquiries,"" Christian Schreiber, a law clerk to the judge, told Motherboard in an email. The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment. ""When it comes to this kind of secret and hard to understand technological search, the government holds all the cards, and it is crucial that the government be very careful to explain itself fully and accurately,"" Wessler added.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4xave3/judge-in-fbi-hacking-case-is-unclear-on-how-fbi-hacking-works,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,996

2017-03-21 00:00:00,2017,3.0,21,UK group expanding campaign to curb antibiotics in meat production,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A shareholder coalition founded in the U.K. is recruiting investors for a campaign to convince KFC parent Yum Brands Inc and other food companies to protect public health and corporate profits by reducing the use of antibiotics in the meat they serve in the United States and around the world. Scientists warn that the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farm animals contributes to the rise of dangerous infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria known as superbugs, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a major threat to global health. “It’s the kind of risk that doesn’t discriminate. An illness that is resistant to antibiotics could happen anywhere, poor or rich,” Natalie Beinisch, engagement manager at Aegon Asset Management, said by telephone from the Hague. Members noted that chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc and McDonald’s USA have used strict antibiotic policies to elevate their brands. “There is the potential for significant opportunity for those food companies that get the recipe for sustainable food production right,” said Jeremy Coller, founder of the Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return Initiative (FAIRR) and chief investment officer at Coller Capital in London. This year the coalition plans to keep up the pressure on Yum, whose policy lags those of major chains such as McDonald’s Corp, whose U.S. restaurants last year stopped serving chicken raised with antibiotics important to human medicine. The coalition also is pressing large food companies to set clear timelines for phasing out the routine use of antibiotics in chicken, pork and beef in all markets where they operate. ShareAction and the FAIRR Initiative lead the group, whose members include Aviva Investors, Aegon Asset Management and Green Century Capital Management. The mostly European and U.S. coalition debuted last year with 54 investors representing about $1 trillion under management. It since has added 17 new members and doubled assets under management. A broad campaign to curb antibiotics has been gaining steam in recent years with help from rising consumer interest, pressure from doctors and non-profit groups, and meaningful responses from companies such as McDonald’s and Tyson Foods Inc, the world’s second-largest poultry company. “It’s a domino effect. Once suppliers move ... there’s no excuse not to move,” said Leslie Samuelrich, president of Boston’s Green Century Capital Management, who spoke at a coalition event for investors at BlackRock’s New York City offices on Monday.

2019-12-12 00:00:00,2019,12.0,12,House passes Speaker Nancy Pelosi's bill to lower drug prices,"The House of Representatives on Thursday passed Speaker Nancy Pelosi's drug pricing legislation, a sweeping bill that will allow the U.S. government to negotiate lower prices on the costliest drugs each year. The bill's chances of becoming law are slim. The legislation is unlikely to be taken up in the Senate, where lawmakers have introduced a competing health-care bill. Additionally, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has previously ruled out any action on Pelosi's bill, and President Donald Trump, who is in the middle of an impeachment inquiry, has vowed to veto it. Nevertheless, the legislation will likely give voters a preview of the party's platform on health care ahead of the 2020 elections. The legislation ""delivers on President Trump's promise to the American people,"" Pelosi said Thursday, referring to Trump's comments in 2016 that he would ""negotiate"" the cost of drugs ""like crazy."" ""Negotiation is what this bill is about."" Current rules prohibit the Department of Health and Human Services from negotiating drug prices on behalf of Medicare — the federal government's health insurance plan for the elderly. Private insurers use pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate drug rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers in exchange for better coverage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates Pelosi's bill, if enacted, would save Medicare $456 billion over a decade but also keep eight new drugs from coming to the U.S. market. Republicans and the drug industry were heavily opposed to the bill. House Republicans criticized it as highly partisan and warned that the legislation would spur the loss of lifesaving cures and medical innovation. Industry trade group PhRMA, or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, shared similar sentiments, saying it would result in at least 56 fewer medicines. Private equity investors had also been lobbying against Pelosi's bill, telling her legislative aides in a series of private meetings in recent weeks that the plan would dry up financing for small biotech companies. ""With today's vote, the House prioritized politics at the expense of innovation, American jobs and hope for patients,"" PhRMA president and CEO Stephen Ubl said in a statement Thursday. Pelosi and fellow House Democratic leaders had been working for months on a plan to reduce U.S. drug prices. High prescription drug costs have become a rare bipartisan issue, drawing support from Democrats in Congress and the Trump administration. Health care remains a top issue for voters ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Congress and the Trump administration are trying to pass legislation before the end of the year that would bring more transparency to health-care costs and, ultimately, lower costs for consumers. In the Senate, lawmakers are working on their own drug pricing bill, seen as a more ""moderate"" alternative to Pelosi's. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and ranking Democrat Ron Wyden, of Oregon, unveiled last week a revamped version of their bipartisan drug price bill that is backed by Trump. It would make changes to Medicare by adding an out-of-pocket maximum for beneficiaries and capping drug price increases at the rate of inflation, among other measures.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/12/house-passes-speaker-nancy-pelosis-drug-pricing-bill.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,507

2017-08-28 00:00:00,2017,8.0,28,Expedia vs. Uber: Diversity statistics for new CEO,"We still don't know if Dara Khosrowshahi will accept the job of Uber's boss — leading a company mired in human resources issues. If he does, the Iranian immigrant will walk into a company that's much less diverse than his current one, Expedia. Expedia, which includes brands like Hotels.com, Orbitz, Trivago, Travelocity, Hotwire and CarRentals.com, has been touting its efforts on pay parity and women in leadership for several years. Expedia's U.S. workforce is 51 percent women and 49 percent men, according to data released in June of last year. That's compared to Uber's U.S. business, where 32.9 percent of workers are women, and 67.1 percent are men. Neither company fares nearly as well when it comes to technology workers, but Expedia still has the lead. Khosrowshahi's ability to build up a roster of women in leadership could become particularly critical to Uber, a company where sexual harassment allegations led to a scathing workplace culture investigation, and ultimately, a massive exodus of top employees. It's something that board members like Arianna Huffington have said Uber must fix urgently. To be sure, there are many different ways to measure progress in terms of diversity and inclusion — including the intersection of race and gender, the stratification of roles and policies like family leave. Even Google — a ""top company for women technologists ""— has struggled to strike a balance when it comes to how much to emphasize gender equity in hiring and pay. Khosrowshahi has very favorable reviews on anonymous employer review site Glassdoor, with a ""creme de la creme"" 93 percent approval rating. But on InHerSight, a similar, smaller platform that focuses on opportunities for women, Expedia doesn't have the same glowing reviews. One user wrote (edited): The CEO Dara also made it a leadership-down sponsored initiative to try to promote more women to director level and higher roles ... which was great in theory, however, many male VPs still treat the company as a boys' club. A few examples of the boys' club: It was expected as a female that if my VP walked into the kitchen while I was in the kitchen that I would offer to step aside for him to get his coffee, because his time is more important than mine; or, offer to take his coffee mug and get his coffee and hand deliver it to where ever his next meeting would be. I also consider it a boys' club because in exec prep meetings they would often expect the females participating in the meeting to order and pick up dinner for the entire team while our male direct reports stayed to participate. Expedia was not immediately available to comment on that review. Expedia subsidiary Egencia has admitted that the company still sees inclusion programs as in the ""early stages."" For instance, Melissa Hannigan, global director of talent acquisition for Egencia, said earlier this year that the company has been testing blind resume reviews and has been updating job postings. ""What we found is that many job adverts have a masculine bias to them. Words like 'manage' attract more male candidates whereas 'lead' attracts more females. Just like with blind resumes, we tested this across certain areas of the business and saw positive results and have now rolled it out company-wide,"" Hannigan said in a statement.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/28/expedia-vs-uber-diversity-statistics-for-new-ceo.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,551

The senators sought transparency and answers on what the company is doing to ensure children's privacy and safety online, and meet expectations of parents and fulfill law obligations. The senators also asked Zuckerberg when did the company first become aware of the flaw and the duration it existed.

2017-06-06 08:00:30,2017,6.0,6,"Playing Catch-Up to Uber on Self-Driving, Lyft Teams Up With Partners","SAN FRANCISCO — Uber is spending millions of dollars to make self-driving cars on its ride-hailing network a reality. Now Lyft, one of Uber’s biggest competitors, is striking a series of partnerships to do the same. Lyft on Tuesday announced an agreement with nuTonomy, a self-driving car start-up, to eventually bring thousands of nuTonomy’s autonomous vehicles to Lyft’s ride-hailing network. The partnership will initially focus on research and development related to the customer experience of summoning an autonomous vehicle, Lyft said. It is part of a larger outreach to the autonomous vehicle industry to join what Lyft calls its “Open Platform Initiative” to work with the ride-hailing company. “Our ultimate responsibility is to bring the best autonomous vehicles to Lyft’s millions of passengers,” Logan Green, Lyft’s chief executive, said in an interview. “And since it’s very early in the development life cycle of autonomous vehicles, we’ll explore many partnerships to learn with and from partners to help figure out what passengers want.” The agreement is part of Lyft’s broader move into autonomous car-sharing. Mr. Green has long postulated that the future of transportation will be less focused on private car ownership. There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived — and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think. But Lyft is behind others in making inroads into that future. Uber, for example, has hundreds of engineers in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto working on its self-driving technology, and it has outfitted Volvos and Ford Fusion vehicles with cameras, lasers and other hardware for research purposes. Uber has recently been embroiled in a lawsuit over autonomous vehicle technology with Waymo, which operates under Google’s parent company. Lyft’s approach to self-driving vehicles is different from Uber’s. It does not have teams of engineers developing technology for autonomous driving. Mr. Green described how Lyft instead plans to be involved in multiple partnerships, whether with self-driving software developers like nuTonomy, or with automakers like General Motors, a major Lyft investor. Last month, Lyft confirmed it will partner with Waymo on self-driving products. Both companies have yet to disclose the details of the arrangement or what kind of collaboration is to be expected. “We see ourselves as a kind of Switzerland,” Mr. Green said. “We don’t think there will be a single player that will win the whole autonomous vehicle game.” Founded in 2013, nuTonomy was spun out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and, last year, raised $16 million in venture capital. NuTonomy has been testing its self-driving software with riders on public roads in Singapore for about a year, and it will begin its pilot program with Lyft in the Boston area, where nuTonomy’s headquarters are, in the coming months. Karl Iagnemma, chief executive of nuTonomy, said he looked forward to working with Lyft, as “both companies care immensely about solving urban transportation issues and the future of our cities.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/technology/lyft-self-driving-nutonomy-partnership.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,482
2019-03-10 00:00:00,2019,3.0,10,SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell turns Elon Musk's bold space ideas into a business,"Risk Takers 2019: Sometimes a risk works. Sometimes it fails. Sometimes it takes years before you know. See who else made the list. SpaceX has a booming business launching satellites to space, and 2018 was its busiest year yet. Now the company is pouring money into two audacious investments: a massive constellation of internet satellites and a rocket to Mars. The projects are the brainchild of SpaceX founder Elon Musk. Overseeing the day-to-day operations at SpaceX, however, falls on the shoulders of president and chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell. Shotwell is charged with turning Musk's bold visions into a sustainable business. She juggles the risk behind the scenes. Launching rockets is high stakes by nature. Many millions of dollars are on the line each time SpaceX lights up one of its 230-foot-tall launch vehicles to send a payload to space. In 2018, Shotwell oversaw 20 flights of SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket. It also debuted a new launch vehicle, the Falcon Heavy, which became the world's most powerful operational rocket. But its largest gambles are ahead.  The company wants to build a massive spaceship and rocket system, called Starship and Super Heavy, that would far outpower anything humankind has ever built. Musk hopes to one day use it to start a human colony on Mars.  SpaceX is also in the early stages of developing a constellation of thousands of satellites that could beam cheap, high-speed internet down to Earth. The projects are expected to cost billions of dollars — as much as $10 billion each, according to Musk and Shotwell. And SpaceX announced in January that it would lay off about 10% of its 6,000-person workforce to save money. ""Either of these developments, even when attempted separately, have bankrupted other organizations,"" SpaceX said in a statement when the job cuts were announced. Shotwell, 55, isn't as well-known as her billionaire boss. But she has carved out a reputation in the aerospace industry as the levelheaded leader of the most successful commercial rocket company in the world. Matt Desch, the chief executive of satellite firm Iridium, a major SpaceX customer, said that while Musk can be seen as the risk-taker-in-chief at SpaceX, Shotwell is its key to success.  She puts people in place at launch time; she makes the tough business calls; and when Musk spurs controversy, ""she's the cleanup,"" Desch said. ""That's one of her strengths,"" Desch said. ""She's adept at managing a very high-profile boss."" For example, when SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket finally reached the launch pad in 2018, after years of delays, Musk repeatedly suggested the rocket could explode. ""People [came] from all around the world,"" he told CNN Business, ""to see what will either be a great rocket launch or the best fireworks display they've ever seen."" The casual mentions of a potential explosion spooked one of SpaceX's customers, Bloomberg reported last year. Shotwell flew to Saudi Arabia to meet with the customer, ArabSat, which had reserved a Falcon Heavy flight, to assure them it would be a reliable vehicle. ""Look, Elon is just trying to set the stage to make sure that people understand that this is a demo flight,"" Shotwell told ArabSat executives. ""We are not going to lift off if we actually think the probability is as bad as 50-50."" Despite the apparent challenges of working for Musk, when asked about him, Shotwell consistently replies: ""I love working for Elon."" Shotwell isn't a stranger to risk: she left a steady position at the Aerospace Corporation, where she worked for a decade, to take a job in the startup world. In 2002, Shotwell, an engineer by training, became SpaceX's first head of business development and its seventh employee. Steve Isakowitz, CEO of the Aerospace Corporation, was at NASA when Shotwell and Musk came to the space agency looking for early funding. SpaceX was virtually unknown at the time and had yet to launch a rocket into orbit. But Isakowitz said he was so impressed by Shotwell's sales pitch, he told them he would ""write them a check right now if I could."" ""In those early days of getting that first rocket to work, there was a lot of people saying they can't do it,"" he said. ""I give Gwynne a lot of credit."" Shotwell later helped SpaceX land massive contracts with NASA ""that kept SpaceX alive during its leanest years,"" Musk biographer Ashlee Vance wrote. And she ""managed to sell about a dozen flights to a mix of government and commercial customers before SpaceX put its first [rocket] into orbit."" SpaceX is currently one of the highest-valued private firms in the world at $30.5 billion.  It has a solid book of customers — from the public and private sectors — lined up to send satellites or other payloads into orbit aboard SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX is also due to start flying NASA astronauts to the International Space Station as soon as this summer, which will mark the first human spaceflight in company history. Shotwell, for her part, is not worried about SpaceX's ability to execute on any of its bold promises. In a recent interview with Marketplace, she said she was confident that, a decade from now, SpaceX will be ""taking people regularly to and from Mars.""

2017-11-17 00:01:00,2017,11.0,17,What Was the ‘Blue Flash’ Some Saw at Chernobyl? New Study Challenges Timeline," The Chernobyl disaster, which occurred on April 26, 1986, was the most catastrophic nuclear accident in history, claiming dozens of lives in its immediate aftermath and thousands more to extended radiation exposure.   Given its devastating human toll and cultural impact, which included the reignition of intense concern over nuclear power risks, the leadup to Chernobyl’s reactor 4 failure has been exhaustively examined over the past 31 years. The prevailing consensus is that the meltdown, which was triggered by a safety test gone wrong, resulted in two explosions in quick succession: First, a steam eruption, and a few seconds later, a nuclear blast.   But a study published in  Nuclear Technology on Thursday makes a compelling case to reverse this conventional timeline. Led by Lars-Erik De Geer, a retired nuclear physicist from the Swedish Defence Research Agency, the authors propose that the steam explosion came on the heels of a nuclear explosion, not the other way around.   The hypothesis’ smoking gun lies in the Russian city of Cherepovets, which is about 230 miles north of Moscow. Four days after the explosions in Chernobyl, scientists based at the V.G. Khlopin Radium Institute in Saint Petersburg (then, Leningrad) detected fresh xenon signatures in this municipal region, suggesting it lay within the trajectory of radiation debris from the disaster.  But Cherepovets is off the path of known Chernobyl contamination that reached throughout central Europe and Scandinavia. To explain this inconsistency, De Geer and his colleagues propose that an initial nuclear explosion shot a nasty jet of reactor debris about two miles into the skies.   This high-flying fallout could have been picked up by a different weather pattern at its elevated altitude, guiding it northeast towards Cherepovets, in contrast to the subsequent steam explosion that ruptured the reactor, which spewed debris northwest.  To back up this origin story for the Cherepovets xenon readings, the team point to a local fisherman’s account of a “blue flash” over the reactor, which could be consistent with an initial nuclear blast rather than a steam explosion.  Seismic readings taken 62 miles (100 kilometers) west of the explosion site could also be evidence of a large initial nuclear blast, the authors said, while the pattern of damage dealt to the reactor, which included the melting of a two-meter-thick core plate, may have been caused by a nuclear explosion preceding the steam blast.   Over email, I asked De Geer if he had any further studies in the works about the reimagined meltdown sequence, but he told me this is just one of many post-retirement projects in his “bag of ideas,” and next up, he’ll be researching nuclear tests, rather than accidents.  Other nuclear scientists, however, may follow-up on this possible twist to one of the most investigated technological disasters in history. It will be up to them to find out if there is evidence to either further substantiate the new chronology, or poke holes in it. Either way, Chernobyl is still full of mystery, both macabre and fascinating, over three decades after the region was changed forever.

2018-09-11 16:12:00,2018,9.0,11,Ultra Runner Stopped to Breastfeed During 103-Mile Race,"There are no breaks from parenting a young child — even 16 hours into a 103-mile race. Ultra runner Sophie Power learned just how true that can be when she tackled the famed Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc (UTMB) race through the Alps just three months after giving birth her son Cormac. For the first part of the race, she was unable to breastfeed or pump, and pushed out her milk by hand to stop the build-up. “Oh my god I was in agony!” Power said in an interview shared with PEOPLE. “Cormac usually feeds every three hours and it took me 16 to get to Courmayeur, where he could first meet me, so I was hand expressing everywhere I could en route. I was so relieved he was hungry!” After meeting Cormac and her husband John at the stop 16 hours in, she had to reconfigure her plan, and started using a breast pump at each aid station where John could meet her. Though breastfeeding made the race far more complicated, Power says she preferred it. “I enjoyed this year’s UTMB far more than I would have done running it in the past,” she says. “I had to go so slowly — I couldn’t raise my heart rate too much as my body isn’t primed to burn fat and I couldn’t fully run down hills to protect my pelvis.” And this year, Power was less focused on her time (though she still managed to run all 103 miles in 43 hours and 33 minutes), and more interested in the stunning mountain views. “In a typical race I would get in and out of the aid stations as quickly as possible but here I had to focus on keeping down enough food (for me and for Cormac!) and resting,” she says. “The goal was simply to get round the course which gave me so much time to take in the views, chat to people and really absorb the whole experience. It was also a much needed mental break to only have to think about looking after myself for once.” Power says that this experience has likely changed her racing style moving forward. “It feels like I’m embracing a whole new racing philosophy,” she says. “I’m going to slow down and enjoy special races like this. When you’re in the mountains, some runners don’t look up and see the views. I live in central London so I wanted to make the most of it.” Power says she was able to maintain her fitness for this race with workouts throughout her pregnancy. She believes that women are often incorrectly told that they can’t exercise while carrying a child. “During pregnancy, it felt like all the advice was to put your feet up and get fat as anything else was taking a risk,” she says. “This is not the best way to prepare for motherhood — staying fit, healthy and strong is so important and how you can safely do that needs to be talked about more.”",https://people.com/health/ultra-runner-breastfeeding-during-103-mile-race/,health,People,health,502

2017-05-23 16:00:00,2017,5.0,23,There's a Formula for Detecting Bullshit," How do you spot a liar? Check his facts. While some experts claim you can read microexpressions or tone of voice or body language, the truth is, liars are pretty easy to detect without getting a Ph.D. in neuroscience. After several fact-checked lies (or an election), you're bound to conclude that the guy is a consistent liar. It may take a while, but we all end up knowing who the liars are.   Now a skilled bullshitter, on the other hand, is hard to spot. That's because his chief tool isn't lies, but logic. Instead of setting the truth on fire, he twists it into seductive patterns.   A liar tells you the acre of alligator-infested swamp he's selling is a well-drained paradise. A bullshitter pitches the same swamp by asking if you like paddleboarding. A liar says he never dealt with the Russians. A bullshitter says the Russians are our best hope against ISIS.  Sometimes a liar and a bullshitter are the same animal. But not always. With the liar, the truth eventually comes out—possibly when you're standing waist deep in water. With the bullshitter, you tend to blame yourself for being so damn stupid. Watch More From VICE: Stand Up Comedy... On Acid! So you might as well skip the lie detector. But is there a bullshit detector? One that can stop you from being manipulated, voting for the wrong person, buying stuff you don't need, or falling in love with a good looking cheating liar? Why, yes there is.   It comes from rhetoric, the 3,000-year-old art of persuasion. This bullshit detector was first described by the philosopher Aristotle, the man who invented logic as we know it, and who literally wrote the book on rhetoric. Let's get even geekier: The detector has a barely pronounceable name, the enthymeme. (EN-the-meme, if you do care to pronounce it.)  The enthymeme has two parts: the proof, and the conclusion. The proof can be a fact, a statistic, or a trend. It's the reason for the conclusion. The conclusion is whatever the speaker wants you to believe or do.  A lot of bullshitters take advantage of us by using enthymemes with proofs that aren't proofs at all. Take many ads dreamed up by Madison Avenue. Their conclusion usually is, Buy This Thing. A legitimate proof would be a bunch of boring facts about the product's features, reliability, low cost, blah blah blah. How often do you see that kind of logical argument in an ad? A Corvette commercial shows a beautiful woman next to the car. Buy this 'Vette because… woman!   Proof: Beautiful woman. Conclusion: Buy this car.  While such bullshit seems patently ridiculous when you parse it logically, it has seduced thousands of middle-aged dentists into spending too much on convertibles.  But men aren't the only sex that succumbs to corporate bullshit. Unilever, the multinational giant that makes everything from cleaning powder to margarine, hawks Dove soap by telling women that they should feel good about their bodies.  Proof: Women should feel good about their bodies. Conclusion: Buy this soap. Those ads are like the dogs in the movie  Up, who would…Squirrel!  Now, here's where the enthymeme can be your best bullshit detector. The enthymeme's two parts, proof and a conclusion, have to work together in sync, and both of them have to be legitimate.   To be a good, trustworthy enthymeme, the proof has to qualify as a proof. You may not know right away whether the proof is true. But you can tell whether it qualifies as a claimed fact, statistic, or trend. ""Women should feel good about their bodies"" fails this test.   Next, the proof should lead to the conclusion. A kid in high school wants to stay at a party after 2 am. ""Nix,"" say his parents. And the kid offers the time-honored argument, ""All the other kids get to stay out.""  Proof: Every child on earth gets to stay out past 2. Conclusion: I should be allowed to stay out.  Assuming the parents don't Google ""average parent curfew for high school students"" (I just did, and only got a lot of bullshit), they can instead use the enthymeme to criticize the logic. Does the claim of universal dawn patrolling support the conclusion that the unique fruit of their loins should fall under that same rule?   Politicians often bullshit us in similar ways, decoupling the proof from the conclusion. Vote for me because…wall! Trump wasn't lying about his proposal to build a wall. (Sure, he was more than shaky with the facts about the existing wall and about illegal immigration and just about everything else. But those facts could all be checked by everyone but Fox News.) A future proposed wall is not a fact. It doesn't exist. You can't lie about a choice. Trump wanted us to vote for him. That was the conclusion. So what's the proof? A wall. So here's the enthymeme:  Proof = wall. Conclusion = vote for Trump.   Vote for him and you get a wall. Ask: Is the wall a good proof of voting for Trump? Will it solve the problems that worry you the most? How much of a problem is there in the first place? And how effective are walls anyway? In short, does the proof lead to the conclusion?  So, next time you're wondering whether you're being taken for a ride, ask whether the proof qualifies as a proof (fact, statistic, trend). The best kind of proof is not a distraction. It's not an anecdote. It's a fact, a statistic, or a trend. That's a proof. Finally, ask whether the proof actually leads to the conclusion.  Think about that scene in Animal House when Delta Tau Chi gets placed on double secret probation. That's a fact. The conclusion offered by the brothers: Toga!  Ask yourself whether the fact—double secret probation—leads to the conclusion—toga party.The answer: Definitely. A toga party is always the proper solution to double secret probation. This is no bullshit.  Jay Heinrichs is the author of the New York Times bestseller, Thank You for Arguing: What Aristotle, Lincoln, and Homer Simpson Can Teach Us About the Art of Persuasion.

2019-01-25 19:27:00,2019,1.0,25,"Mom Opens Up About Toddler's Eczema, Worsened by Prescription Steroid Creams","When Kristi Chun’s 1-1/2-month-old son, Colby, showed signs of eczema on his ear, she picked up a bottle of over-the-counter anti-itch lotion, not realizing she was starting her family on a years-long journey of doctors’ visits and sleepless nights. The Cetaphil was effective practically overnight, the mom of one recalls to PEOPLE, but when it returned the next time on his mouth, as well, she and her husband took Colby to a doctor. Within a week of the first signs of eczema, the Chuns’ pediatrician prescribed them a steroid cream. Initially, Chun recalls, the doctor told her that they don’t usually “jump to steroids,” but she still received the prescription in a “casual conversation.” “There was no discussion or patient counseling about dangers of using it, potential side effects, how long you should use it for, anything like that,” the mom tells PEOPLE. The prescription, Triamcinolone, worked successfully for a few weeks until the skin rashes came back on Colby’s face and neck crease. Because it was “oozy” more than it had been in the past, Chun asked her doctor if it could be a yeast infection. The doctor’s response? A prescription anti-fungal cream, Nystatin with steroids, Chun says — but no one told her about the latter ingredient. Once again, the mom applied a thin layer on Colby’s skin and it disappeared almost overnight. When it came back, though, it was in his leg and arm creases, too. The solution was more steroid cream, the doctor told her, Chun recalls, adding that all the while, she was trying to eliminate any potential causes of Colby’s flare-ups from her home. “I was breastfeeding, so I was on an elimination diet,” she says. “We were changing detergents, doing everything possible to try and find the cause of eczema.” Then, after four weeks of using the creams, Colby, about 2 months old at the time, woke up at 3 a.m. “screaming. His body was dripping and oozing, and he just would not go back to sleep,” Chun says. So she scheduled an emergency doctor’s appointment, and the practitioner recommended three days of oral steroids. Concerned about the other doc’s previous statement about steroids not usually being the first line of defense, Chun consulted with a doctor friend about the three-day treatment. She recalls that he said it was fine because the dosage would only last briefly. One day of the medicine later, Colby was fine again, but days later came another whole-body flare-up. The Chuns then sought a dermatologist, who prescribed, again, more steroid cream. “She was very casual in the way she prescribed it. She gave us more of what we already had and a prescription oil for his scalp,” Chun continues, adding that they used it on his whole body, including his cradle cap. The cycle of Colby recovering almost immediately and then suffering even worse rashes continued for six weeks. There were periods where he wouldn’t sleep for more than 45 minutes at a time. All the while, the Chuns regularly brought their son to the dermatologist. “Every time we’d bring him back, they’d say, ‘Okay, put more [steroid cream]. Put it on his torso, his legs,’ ” Chun says. “We’d ask about natural solutions, and she’d say, ‘We’d prefer not to because natural doesn’t mean it’s good or that he wouldn’t have an allergic reaction.’ “ In Chun’s desperate search to find anything that would provide her infant some relief, she discovered wet wraps. The treatment calls for a layer of emollient directly on the skin, a wet layer of fabric, then a dry layer of fabric — and a conversation with a doctor if it’s used in conjunction with steroids. Chun says the doctor told her to apply the steroids before the emollient and then proceed with the product’s instructions. “He’s this tiny little thing, and he would scream like he was being tortured,” when the mom applied the wet wraps, she says. “I thought I was doing the right thing.” After two weeks of the wet wraps — and a lot of searching online for support for her son’s condition — Chun discovered the condition topical steroid withdrawal, also known as TSW. “I saw there was a pattern,” she says. “It got to a point where I could predict when the eczema would come back. At that point, I realized that he was reacting to the steroids and I’d have to take him off them.” Although Chun was confident in her assessment with what was wrong with her son, doctors “did not support” her and said to keep Colby on the drugs. But they did stop using the steroids, and “it got even worse,” she recalls. “His whole body was swollen, his feet looked like balloons, his legs were huge, and his skin was very weak. He would bleed so easily.” Finally, though, after six to eight months of trying natural alternatives to steroids, from coconut oil, to wheat grass cream and organic honey, Colby smiled for the first time Chun could ever remember. Now that Colby is 21 months old, he’s finally starting to live a normal, steroid-free life, his mom says. “Only within the past couple weeks has he been able to take a normal bath without screaming,” she explains. “He’s able to enjoy life for the most part.” Based on her research — she’s relied heavily on the International Topical Steroid Addiction Network for information — Chun expects Colby to be fully recovered by the time he turns 3. For parents whose sons and daughters are struggling with eczema — about 13 percent of kids do — Chun recommends always getting a second medical opinion about how to treat the condition. Chun also advises always checking the FDA warning label before giving a child any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, even if they’re handed over totally casually. “Doctors often prescribe things thinking there’s no chance of addiction,” she says, “but clearly it’s not always fine.”",https://people.com/health/toddlers-eczema-turns-into-oozing-scabbed-skin-on-every-inch-of-body-due-to-steroid-cream/,health,People,health,991

2017-06-29 21:45:00,2017,6.0,29,"Oh Good, the Plague Is Still a Thing"," Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse (the warming planet, healthcare ""reform,"" toxic air, etc), plague is in the news. The New Mexico Department of Health recently announced that two women had plague, bringing the number of cases in the state this year to three. The two women and one man were hospitalized and released after a few days. News of a plague ""outbreak"" conjures images of the Black Death ravaging cities in the Middle Ages, like in that Monty Python sketch. There's no need to go all Fear the Walking Dead yet, though. New Mexico has long suffered a handful of yearly plague cases: Last year the state saw four cases, with no fatalities; in 2015, four people contracted plague, and one person died. But the fact that there were three cases announced this month alone is the opposite of comforting. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), plague occurs in rural and semi-rural states in the western US, particularly New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado. Fleas feed on rodents and mammals infected with the plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, and then transmit it to humans by biting them. One expert told The New York Times that environmental factors make New Mexico especially plague-friendly: vegetation there supports plenty of rodents, which in turn support plenty of fleas. As the disease picks off one rodent species, it can jump to another, which eventually puts it in contact with humans. Still, even New Mexico has only a few cases every year. The CDC notes that plague arrived in the United States around 1900, and between then and 2012, there were only 1,000 confirmed or probable cases reported. Recent decades have seen an average of about 7 cases a year. The World Health Organization found 3,248 reported cases globally between 2010 and 2015, 584 of which were fatal. Antibiotics have made plague much less lethal than it was in the past: The CDC says that from 1900 to 1941, the mortality rate for US plague infections was 66 percent; today, thanks to antibiotic treatments, that rate is closer to 11 percent. But there are caveats: plague has to be treated quickly, and some forms are more deadly than others. There are three types of plague: bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic. All produce fever and general weakness, some come with chills and headaches—symptoms easily mistaken for the flu. Bubonic plague, the most common form and the one known as the ""Black Death,"" is marked by swollen lymph nodes, is the least deadly. (Eighty percent of cases in the US are bubonic.) Pneumonic plague produces severe pneumonia that can be deadly; septicemic plague attacks the blood cells, causing tissue to blacken and die. Obviously, if you have any of these plague symptoms, you should see a doctor. Generally, though, while ""plague"" sounds archaic, alien, and uniquely threatening, it's also incredibly rare and treatable. Three cases in New Mexico this year isn't quite the start of a real #tbt to the days of ""bring out your dead,"" but, you know, keep up with those flea treatments on your pets.

2019-02-25 00:00:00,2019,2.0,25,Singapore wants self-driving cars to help its aging society,"Singapore (CNN Business)It may look like a giant robotic bug but the MooAV could be the car of the future.  Made by startup MooVita, it's one of dozens of autonomous vehicles being put to the test at a special center in Singapore that aims to advance the development of self-driving car technology. Startups from around the world are coming to the purpose-built track that recreates an urban environment over 5 acres at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University. The roads look like any other in the city, with stop lights, crosswalks and traffic signs. There's even a rain simulator. It's all part of an effort to test how autonomous vehicles cope with all those elements. Dillip Limbu, MooVita's CEO, said the quirky design of the company's car, the MooAV, is intentional. ""In order for the public to know that this is different to conventional cars, it needs to be noticeably different on first impressions, and stand out in comparison to other cars,"" he told CNN. Projects like Nanyang's test track have helped Singapore become a hub for the development of self-driving vehicles. That role fits with the city-state's broader push to encourage the growth of its tech sector and tackle some of the challenges it faces at the same time.   ""Singapore is aging more rapidly and [at] a faster rate than anywhere else in the world, and so we have a situation where, in order to provide mobility for seniors, it would be really advantageous to have such technology available,"" said Subodh Mhaisalkar, the professor in charge of Nanyang's Energy Research Institute, which carries out autonomous vehicle research. The institute's self-driving work focuses on groups like the elderly or disabled who they believe would be the first to benefit from the technology. Concern about a potential bus driver shortage in the coming years is also a reason for developing new forms of public transportation.  ""We're asking the question for the last mile. Can we replace some of the transportation options with autonomous vehicles?"" Mhaisalker said. Mingling with regular traffic Autonomous vehicles are already mingling with traditional cars on Singapore's roads in designated towns and zones. The Singapore government has imposed limitations, though, to make sure things don't move ahead too fast. Speed limits are as low as 30 kilometers per hour (19 mph), and the presence of a safety driver is required by law. The risks of testing self-driving cars on public streets were brought to global attention when a woman died after being hit by an autonomous Uber vehicle in Arizona last year. Experts say Singapore is well prepared for the gradual introduction of the technology. Cities like Singapore that have ""extremely high sophistication of infrastructure would be the first places where autonomous vehicles would be deployed readily, compared to other cities,"" Mhaisalkar said.  ""You can test mega-city driving in a comparatively controlled environment, but do so with extremely sophisticated infrastructure.""  For the past two years, consulting firm KPMG has ranked Singapore as the second best prepared country for autonomous vehicles after the Netherlands. KPMG's Autonomous Vehicles Readiness Index takes into account technological advancements, government policies, consumer interest and other factors.  The MooAV, which is still in research and development, functioned much like an ordinary car on the university test track, respecting stop lights, stopping for pedestrians and taking passengers from one point to another.  According to Limbu, cars like the MooAV will become a common sight in Singapore for ferrying passengers on fixed routes in Singapore in the next few years.

Pray for me please,” she added. Today is day 4 of the cleanse and I am 5 lbs down. I didn’t see any weight difference until today so that’s motivation I needed today. I am only 5’3 so this makes a big difference and for the next 3 days it’s all liquids. Pray for me please 😜 — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) April 20, 2018  Opening up about her health routine on her website/app on Thursday, the KKW Beauty mogul revealed she had been “so excited” to start the cleanse because “the food looked so filling and there are only three days that you just drink liquids.” “I have the Met Gala coming up and I’ve worked so hard working out, but I started eating a lot of sweets and I wanted to just change my food patterns to eat healthier and cut sugar out of my life as much as I can,” she wrote. “We always have sweets around and it’s really hard when there are temptations everywhere. I already completed day one and two of the cleanse, and I’ve been surrounded by doughnuts, but I stayed away. I’m so proud of myself!” she added. Continuing, she wrote, “This is seriously not a sponsored thing, I just really wanted to try it.” Days before announcing her cleanse, the mother of three thanked trainer Melissa Alcantara for helping to transform her body. “Shout out to my trainer @fitgurlmel who really changed my body,” the 37-year-old wrote alongside a bikini snap from her recent vacation to Turks and Caicos with sister Kourtney Kardashian. “When I wasn’t happy with what I saw back in the mirror I spent a whole year training so hard 5 or 6 days a week putting in a lot of work and changed the way that I eat and there’s such a noticeable difference,” the reality star said, adding that now not only was her body firmer, but also that she had “less cellulite and so much more” confidence. “THANK YOU for waking up at 5am to do crazy bodybuilding workouts & springs that I hate 😜& putting me on to this lifestyle,” she added. Detailing the “grueling” fitness routine, KUWTK star’s trainer previously told PEOPLE Kardashian West was “committed” to putting in the hard work needed in order to really see results. “She can’t believe how much has changed over the last few months.

2016-11-07 00:00:00,2016,11.0,7,"As election nears, vote trading gains steam","As the election nears, thousands of people are signing up to ""trade"" their votes. Here's how it works: A Gary Johnson supporter in a swing state like Ohio can promise to vote for Hillary Clinton. In exchange, a Clinton supporter in a strong blue state like California would promise to vote for Johnson. Voila! Both get to make sure their votes count while staying true to their principles. It's not a new concept, but a number of online marketplaces are springing up to make it easier to swap votes. And the growing movement could make all the difference in a tight race. Two of the biggest vote trading platforms that have sprung up during this election are #NeverTrump and TrumpTraders.org. As of Sunday evening, they said they've facilitated the trading of over 50,000 votes combined, and more than 12,000 in key swing states. Silicon Valley entrepreneur Amit Kumar is the founder of #NeverTrump and says the response has been overwhelming. He says the pace of signups quickened over the weekend and people have been using the app in real time while in line during early voting. ""People are coming here and finding strangers,"" Kumar says. ""From California to Florida. From Facebook to Instagram to Twitter, people can connect. It's been crazy. "" John Stubbs is a lifelong Republican and a founder of R4C16.org, a group of Republicans for Clinton. He started TrumpTraders.org and says the number of ""vote trades"" for Clinton are growing in Colorado, New Hampshire and Nevada. But vote trading is far from foolproof. The two people who promise to vote for each other's candidate rely on the honor system. In some cases, as Kumar tells us, two voters have crossed state borders to meet each other face-to-face to feel more comfortable swapping votes. But there's no way to hold someone to their word in the actual voting booth. Vote trading is not without controversy either. Some critics have suggested it's illegal. But in 2007, a court case found it's protected by the First Amendment. ""As long as people don't trade favors or money,"" Kumar said. ""What you do in the polling booth is your freedom. Anyone trying to solicit votes for money is illegal."" Vote trading platforms like his simply connect voters and facilitate the conversation, he said. Meddlers are a different story, though, as Kumar says ""tons of Trump voters"" are trying to cause disruption within the app. This method was first attempted during the close presidential race between Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000. Sixteen years later, the internet is far more effective at spreading the word and facilitating trades. As Stubbs of TrumpTraders.org reminds us: The difference in Florida in 2000 was just 537 votes.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/07/as-election-nears-vote-trading-gains-steam.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,453
2016-10-31 00:00:00,2016,10.0,31,Some groups getting left behind in advance care planning,"(Reuters Health) - More than a quarter of older U.S. Medicare beneficiaries have not done any advanced care planning, and Latinos, African Americans and people with low incomes are least likely to have made end-of-life arrangements, according to a new research letter. “We expected to see that older adults in worse health more frequently discussed of end-of-life plans and preferences,” said Krista Lyn Harrison, a geriatrics researcher, Division of Geriatrics, School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco. “Instead, we saw either no difference or less frequent discussions in these populations,” she said. “In the case of older adults with dementia, they or their proxies reported discussing advance care planning less frequently than those without dementia,” Harrison told Reuters Health by email. The researchers used data from the long-term National Health and Aging Trends Study of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older who responded to the 2015 main survey and a supplemental module in 2012. Participants answered questions about whether or not they had discussed with anyone what medical treatment they desired if they became seriously ill in the future, whether they had legal arrangements for a proxy to make decisions about medical care and whether they had written instructions about desired medical treatment in the form of an advance directive. They also reported their age, sex, race, education level, income level, self-rated health, number of chronic health conditions, disability in activities of daily living and if they had a dementia diagnosis. About 2,000 Medicare beneficiaries completed the surveys and 1,156 reported having had an end of life discussion, 997 had a legal proxy for health decisions, and 1,027 had an advance directive. Almost 30 percent of people had none of the three advance-care elements, while almost 40 percent had all three, according to the results in JAMA Internal Medicine, October 31. Men, African Americans, Latinos, those with lower levels of educational attainment and lower annual income were less likely than others to have two or more of the three advance care planning elements. Older Spanish-speaking Latinos were the least likely to have taken these steps, with 19 percent saying they had had an end of life discussion, 20 percent had a legal proxy and 17 percent had an advance directive. In comparison, rates for non-Hispanic whites in the same categories were 66 percent, 54 percent and 59 percent, respectively. It’s not clear what drives these disparities, Harrison said. “Our worry is that these differences may occur because clinicians are not proactively engaging older adults and their loved ones in culturally-appropriate discussions about their end-of-life plans and preferences until too late,” she said. “In the case of dementia, often dementia is not recognized as a terminal illness and thus discussions are not begun early enough,” she said. “Race-based differences might be caused by cultural differences in willingness to engage in these discussions, or differences in access to clinicians who are able to have these discussions in the language and culture most comfortable to the older adult and their loved ones,” Harrison said.

2019-09-24 00:00:00,2019,9.0,24,"Australia audits PayPal for money laundering, terror law compliance","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s financial intelligence agency on Tuesday ordered an audit of PayPal Holdings Inc’s compliance with local anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws, saying it was concerned reporting obligations had not been met. AUSTRAC, which is tasked with ensuring compliance with the laws, ordered PayPal’s Australian unit to appoint an external auditor to look at the fund transfers at its own cost and report back within 120 days. AUSTRAC said in a statement that International Funds Transfer Instructions reported by the financial sector provided intelligence that enabled the agency and its partners to combat serious crimes, such as child sex exploitation. “Regulated businesses like PayPal Australia, who facilitate payments and transactions for millions of Australian customers every year, play a critical role in helping AUSTRAC and our law enforcement partners stop the movement of money to criminals and terrorists,” AUSTRAC Chief Executive Nicole Rose said in a statement. PayPal said its Australian unit reported itself to authorities after an internal review found an issue with the way it reported international fund transfers to AUSTRAC. It said suggestions the reason for the audit was the discovery of child sex exploitation connections were not correct. “We are working in full cooperation with AUSTRAC to remediate this reporting system issue and to undertake the audit as outlined by AUSTRAC in the time specified,” PayPal’s senior communications director, Amanda Christine Miller, said in an email. The audit would have no impact on customers, Miller added. U.S.-based PayPal operates a worldwide online payment service which connects buyers and sellers through a secure online wallet linked to both parties’ bank accounts. A preliminary report from a separate review ordered by AUSTRAC into buy-now-pay-later company Afterpay Touch Group in June, citing suspected non-compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws, was due to be handed to AUSTRAC on Tuesday. Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) players let shoppers purchase products without paying upfront, and without the regulatory hurdle of applying for a credit card or loan, raising concerns about shopper identity. AUSTRAC and Afterpay did not immediately respond to questions about that review. Australian regulators are under sustained pressure to act after the Royal Commission inquiry into financial sector misconduct widely condemned their performance in recent years. The Royal Commission found that when misconduct by financial institutions was revealed, it either went unpunished or the regulatory consequences did not reflect the seriousness of what had been done.

2016-08-04 11:33:27,2016,8.0,4,Finding Alternatives to Microsoft Excel,"Tech Tip Q. What other programs can open Excel files? A. If you do not have access to a copy of Microsoft Excel — and do not want to use the browser-based version included with the Office Online suite — you can go with a non-Microsoft product to open spreadsheets created in the Open Office XML Spreadsheet (.xlsx) format. Many of the alternative programs can also open files created in Excel’s older .xls format, along with other common file types like OpenDocument Spreadsheet (.ods), comma-separated values files (.csv) and text documents (.txt). For example, if you are looking for software to install on your Windows-, OS X- or Linux-based computer so you can work without an internet connection, consider free, open-source suites like LibreOffice or Apache OpenOffice. Along with word-processing and presentation applications, both suites include a spreadsheet program called Calc that uses the .ods format — but can open and save files in Microsoft Excel’s native format.

Originally launched in 2013, Timelapse rolled out its largest update ever this week; the application now includes imagery captured from the past four years, and sharper resolution for existing data acquired from 1984 to 2016. This means that users can select any region of the planet, and watch it change over 32 years from the perspective of our Earth-observation satellites. Centers of urban development show a particularly obvious and dramatic shift, sprouting out new communities and industrial centers that take root in surrounding spaces. Take this timelapse of the San Francisco Bay Area from 1984 to 2016, which covers the eastern span replacement of the Oakland Bay Bridge from 2002 to 2013. Meanwhile, the northern Albertan landscape is consumed by the development of the Athabasca oil sands around Fort McMurray, shown in this timelapse. The reverse effect can be seen over Pripyat, Ukraine, home to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant that suffered a catastrophic meltdown on April 26, 1986. Abandoned by its residents, the town was effectively wiped off the map after that event. Beyond populated areas, there are other troubling signs of environmental damage exacerbated by human activity. This view of the rapidly melting Shirase Glacier in Antarctica provides a powerful visualization of the destabilizing effects of climate change. Of course, there are many beautiful views of our planet's recent evolution on Timelapse, and there is even an admirably industrious quality to our ant-like development of so much of it. The tool is also a timely reminder of the many essential applications of satellite-based Earth science—which is a scientific field the incoming Trump administration has indicated it will significantly scale back on. You can explore the world directly on the Timelapse site, or take a tour through Google's playlist of video timelapses on YouTube.

2016-01-12 10:00:00,2016,1.0,12,How NASA Saved the Kepler Telescope from the Brink of Death,"NASA's Kepler Space Telescope is arguably the best planet hunter in the cosmos. And after recovering from a severe injury, the telescope is back in the game. Launched in 2009, the telescope was tasked with finding nearby Earth-like exoplanets in the habitable zone—the area around a star that could support liquid water. Kepler spent four years scanning a small patch of sky, identifying thousands of potential exoplanets. Kepler began its mission looking at one patch of sky, trying to determine how common rocky exoplanets were. During its first four years, over 4,000 exoplanet candidates were detected, all within 500 to 1,000 light-years from Earth. Nearly half of those are designated to be Earth-sized or Super Earths, which tells scientists there could be nearly a billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy alone. This definitely increases the chances of finding habitable planets and maybe even life. To find exoplanets, the telescope searches for tiny dips in starlight produced as a planet crosses in front of its host star—an event known as a transit. Detecting transits takes incredible precision, and Kepler performed beautifully for four years, finding as much as half of all the known exoplanets. Then a hardware malfunction occurred, nearly crippling the telescope. Kepler relies on four reaction wheels to keep on target. When two of them failed in 2013, it looked like Kepler was down for the count, lacking the ability to point with any precision. However, thanks to some crafty engineering, the telescope was given a second chance at life. Engineers at Ball Aerospace—who designed and built the space observatory—devised a clever trick to harness the energy of the Sun in order to help steady the telescope. The science team then submitted a new proposal to NASA, and the K2 mission was born. ""The K2 mission takes the same telescope,"" said Steve Howell, Kepler Project Scientist. ""But uses the light of the Sun as a force to push on the solar panels, and then using the two good reaction wheels to push against that force, we are able to point the telescope."" Earth-like exoplanets discovered by Kepler as compared to Earth, seen on the far right. Image: NASA With the K2 mission, we can now look at points all along the ecliptic (plane of the Solar System). Instead of staring at one field for four years, the telescope is staring at different points along the ecliptic for about 80 days each. ""We just keep going around the ecliptic, staring at different fields of view. This has allowed us to greatly expand the science that comes out of the telescope. We're still doing exoplanets,"" Howell said. ""We're studying what's called high-value exoplanets: ones that are orbiting very close, very bright stars. So we can also study in detail from the ground and characterize the stars and planets and search for atmospheric composition especially in rocky habitable-zone planets. Which you can't do with Kepler planets essentially because they are all too far away."" Due to their close proximity to Earth, the worlds discovered as part of the K2 mission will be the perfect subjects for future space-based observatories like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to study in greater detail. Once we can unlock the secrets of exoplanet atmospheres, we can definitively determine whether or not they are habitable. ""We've discovered over 250 candidates in K2 with 110 already proven to be planets. Six of those are already targets that are interesting enough rocky planets to be looked at by Hubble and eventually JWST to get atmospheric measurements of the planet. Will we see signs of life? What will we see? Pollution? Chlorophyll? It's exciting,"" Howell said. But that's not all. With the K2 mission, Kepler has now become a very valuable tool for astrophysicists. ""We're doing other great science too,"" Howell said. ""Looking at star clusters like the Pleiades, globular clusters, exoplanets, supernovae, planets in our solar system, comets, active galaxies and more. Just tons and tons of science."" Howell explained that the K2 fields of view along the ecliptic don't overlap, so the scientists are seeing new things all the time. Eventually, if funding permits, the K2 mission will observe every part of the cosmos along the ecliptic. Early on in the K2 mission, the telescope got a peek at Comet Siding Spring as it zipped passed Mars. The data collected by Kepler was combined with data from various spacecraft orbiting the Red Planet, and observatories here on Earth. As a result, we have the first ever 3D view of a comet's tail. ""As comets pass through the Solar System, they interact with the solar wind, which strips away bits of the tail. With Kepler and K2 we can observe the comet over an 80-day period,"" explains Howell. ""You can watch the tail structure evolve and see what happens to it as it interacts with the solar wind."" One of the benefits of K2 is the constantly changing field of view. This is a big advantage in observing supernovae—the explosive death of a star. Type IA supernovae are thought to be all the same, in fact they are thought of as standard candles or cosmic mile markers, used to measure distances in the Universe. However, astronomers still aren't exactly sure what causes them. To determine what blew up, you need to observe the supernova in the first few hours after its death. ""You generally can't observe a supernova in the first few hours from the ground, because you don't know it's a supernova yet,"" Howell explained. ""It's not bright enough for you to observe."" The vast majority (about 99.99 percent) of supernovae are observed at least a day after exploding because they haven't reached peak brightness yet. As such, scientists have concluded they all look the same. But do they really? This is one of the questions astrophysicists are hoping K2 will answer. By looking at thousands and thousands of galaxies in each K2 field, all scientists have to do is wait for one to explode. ""In the meantime we are doing wonderful science, but if you do spot one then you can measure it in the first few hours to the first few days. And you can tell exactly what thing blew up by matching it to theoretical models,"" Howell said. So far, Kepler has witnessed three Type IA supernovae during the K2 mission. All three are a result of two white dwarfs—the dying embers of a Sun-like star—merging together. ""We've eliminated it being a white dwarf and another 'real"" star,'"" he said. Howell expects that over the course of the entire K2 mission, at least 80 supernovae will be observed. The data collected will definitively tell scientists if each Type IA supernova observed has the same luminosity, and ultimately if they are the standard candles we've come to rely on. ""So many cool things, it's very exciting science. If you don't know about K2, you should,"" said Howell.

Some 20 people were killed in the attack near Aleppo on the U.N. and Syrian Arab Red Crescent convoy. The United States blamed Russian aircraft. Moscow denies the charge. “With our analysis we determined it was an air strike and I think multiple other sources have said that as well,” Lars Bromley, research adviser at UNOSAT, told a Geneva news briefing. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced on Friday that he would establish an internal U.N. board of inquiry to investigate the attack and urged all parties to fully cooperate.

2018-10-24 16:53:00,2018,10.0,24,Oakland Police Open Records Transparency Investigation After 'Watch Dogs 2' Lawsuit," After playing Watch Dogs 2 and marveling at the accuracy of Ubisoft's recreation of the Bay Area, investigative journalist and researcher for the Electronic Frontier Foundation Dave Maass wanted to know if Ubisoft partnered with the local government to do it. So, as he detailed for Motherboard, he filed open records requests with government agencies in San Francisco and Oakland. He was looking for anything related to Ubisoft working with police departments to create the game, which is set in the near future and features hackers exploiting ubiquitous computer systems to fight back against the police state. His request to San Francisco Police Department confirmed that in 2014, filmmakers working for Ubisoft had approached the SFPD to shoot an internal-only documentary. Ubisoft wanted realistic interviews and footage of officers that it could use as inspiration for the game. Though SF officials eventually turned down Ubisoft's documentary team, they responded to Maass's request quickly. Oakland Police Department, on the other hand, dragged its feet so much that Maass ended up filing a lawsuit in May of this year to force the department to release the documents. In August, because of Maass’s lawsuit, Oakland Police Department's Internal Affairs division launched an investigation into the department's handling of open records requests. “We in the Internal Affairs Division are committed to ensuring professionalism and accountability throughout the Oakland Police Department by aggressively investigating all allegations of misconduct and improper procedures or service within the organization,” a letter sent to Maass states. Last week, OPD finally turned over the relevant documents. The records were hard-won, but they don't show too much information. In January 2015, film director Phil Jeudy contacted Shereda Nosakhare, a special assistant to newly inaugurated Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland, to arrange access for a Ubisoft editorial team. Nosakhare handed the email off to senior advisor Peggy Moore, noting that ""it would be good to have someone [involved] that has Oakland's best interests at heart."" Aside from a follow-up request from Ubisoft a few months later in March, that seems to be the end of Oakland's participation (at least via email.) There was no scandal hiding in the email archives at Oakland City Hall, but making use of open records laws is itself the entire point, Maass said. Open records laws like the Freedom of Information Act or the California Public Records Act are there for the public to use and government agencies to obey. ""[Open records law] is one of the primary tools that allows us to hold the government accountable. It starts with the principle that that government belongs to us and the things they create belong to us and we have a right to look at them—within reason,” he told me. “But in a world where the government is able to operate in secret, even when there's no reason for secrecy, that's when corruption and waste and abuse and fraud happen. That's when decisions that aren't in the interest of the people get made. So it's very important to not only have these laws but to use these laws and stand up for the integrity of these laws when they're being abused—even when it's in a seemingly low-stakes situation."" Maass has in the past filed requests for records pertaining to Comic Con, a staged Viking funeral, and the process behind renaming a city street after Star Wars actor Mark Hamill. The city of San Diego named February 13, 2013, ""Dave Maass Day"" with a proclamation that is, frankly, masterful: ""WHEREAS...Dave Maass has been mildly annoying San Diego's politicos for the past three years...and WHEREAS Dave is personally responsible for no less than three staffers in the City Clerk's officer hired to handle his endless Public Records Act Requests."" Maass enjoys filing records requests that show how the wheels of government interact with various ""geeky"" pursuits that he admits are unimportant. But more to the point, putting these laws to the test often is important. Sensitive records of ongoing investigations are often exempt from open records requests for legitimate reasons. Filing seemingly frivolous requests is one way for the public to stress-test the system: Is Oakland not turning anything over because records are sensitive, or does Oakland PD have a systemic problem with how it responds to these requests? ""It's... very difficult to get lots of police records for criminal investigations, new technology—those can be a real hassle,"" Maass said. ""But if you ask for something related to a video game, maybe that shows you how the process works because there's not a lot for them to exempt."" Maass says other activists have had trouble getting records out of the Oakland government. He's hopeful that his lawsuit and the internal affairs investigation will fix Oakland's public records processes so it can respond appropriately in cases where it really matters. ""If this results in a better public records system, that's the most I could have hoped for,"" Maass said. ""Obviously it would have been awesome if they'd given me 200 pages of going back and forth with Ubisoft, but that doesn't seem to be what happened."" Ubisoft and Oakland Police Department did not respond immediately to comment on this story.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mbdyd4/oakland-police-open-records-transparency-investigation-after-watch-dogs-2-lawsuit,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,859
2020-03-11 00:00:00,2020,3.0,11,SoftBank's Son might reconsider heavily criticized coronavirus test plan,"TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son took to Twitter on Wednesday to offer a million free coronavirus tests, only to get hit by a barrage of criticism that he risked overwhelming medical facilities, prompting him to say he might reconsider the plan. The SoftBank Group chief executive, who last posted on Twitter three years ago, expressed concern about the coronavirus outbreak, telling Twitter followers on Tuesday he was planning to take action. “I would like to provide the opportunity for free PCR testing for those who are worried about the novel coronavirus,” Son (@masason) tweeted on Wednesday. “First, for one million people. We are preparing how they can apply,” he said, referring to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests which can detect very early infections. His proposal was met with criticism that it would overburden medical facilities and workers. Son said he had visited Japan’s health ministry on Wednesday as he wanted to cooperate so that the testing would not cause any burden. He also tweeted an illustration of the PCR scheme under consideration, in which a person could take a nasal swab at home and mail it to a lab which would test the specimen send back the results. But about two hours after his first tweet announcing the PCR test plan, he took to Twitter again to say he might reconsider given the negative feedback. “Since it’s been badly received, maybe I won’t do it...” he said. The coronavirus has spread around the world, with more than 116,000 confirmed cases and 4,000 deaths. Japan has reported close to 1,300 infections, with more than half coming from the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship, and 19 deaths.

2019-05-03 18:15:00,2019,5.0,3,How Common Is an Appendicitis Like Kelly Clarkson's?,"Kelly Clarkson truly is “Stronger” — she managed to host the Billboard Music Awards on Wednesday while suffering from appendicitis, and underwent surgery to remove her appendix just a few hours later. The singer said she had “broken down in tears after the show from pain,” but is now saying “bye bye appendix” after her surgery. Though most people don’t perform a live show with appendicitis, it is an extremely common condition, affecting 1 in 1,000 Americans each year, says Dr. Travis Stork, an ER physician, host of The Doctors and a member of PEOPLE’s Health Squad. It typically happens when a blockage of the appendix leads to an infection. “As bacteria grows, the appendix becomes inflamed and swollen,” Stork says. “Some symptoms to look out for include sharp pain on the right side of the lower abdomen and sudden pain that begins around your navel and then shifts to your lower right abdomen, that gets worse if you make sharp movements like coughing or walking. Also look out for nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, low-grade fever and abdominal bloating.” Head to the doctor if you think something is wrong, and they can determine if surgery is necessary. “Surgical removal of the appendix is the traditional standard procedure because once it is infected the appendix may rupture, spreading infection throughout your abdominal cavity and becoming life-threatening,” Stork says. People can either have an appendectomy, an open surgery using a 2- to 4-inch incision, or a laparoscopic surgery with a small incision. “In general, laparoscopic surgery allows you to recover faster and heal with less pain and scarring, but if your appendix has ruptured and infection has spread beyond the appendix or you have an abscess, you may need an open appendectomy and cleaning of the abdominal cavity,” he says. Luckily for Clarkson and the thousands of Americans who undergo the surgery, the appendix isn’t completely necessary. “Some scientists believe the appendix is a vestigial organ, left over from our leaf-eating ancestors,” Stork says, though he adds, “unnecessary doesn’t mean it doesn’t play a role. Since it is part of the immune system, many think the appendix can stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut.” But once the appendix is gone, it will just take a couple weeks to recover, and then “most people have no long-term side effects or complications,” Stork says.",https://people.com/health/kelly-clarkson-appendicitis-common-condition/,health,People,health,394
2017-09-28 00:00:00,2017,9.0,28,Health chief Price vows no more private plane trips,"Embattled Trump administration health affairs chief will repay the federal government nearly $52,000 for his ""seat"" on more than two dozen pricey private jet trips — which cost taxpayers more than $400,000 — and promised to refrain from using charter flights in the future. ""Today, I will write a personal check to the US Treasury for the expenses of my travel on private charter planes,"" wrote Price, the secretary of the Health and Human Services Department, in a statement released Thursday. ""The taxpayers won't pay a dime for my seat on those planes,"" said Price. Price did not say how much he would be paying back. But an HHS spokeswoman said Price's check would total $51,887.31. That is a small fraction of the more than $400,000 it reportedly cost the government to charter 26 flights on private jets for Price and his traveling companions since May. ""I will take no more private charter flights as Secretary of HHS. No exceptions,"" Price said in his email release. Politico, which broke the stories about Price's penchant for private planes, has reported that HHS claimed private jets were used to accommodate his busy schedule. Late on Thursday, Politico reported that the White House had given Price the OK to use military aircraft for trips to Africa and Europe earlier this year, costing taxpayers more than half a million dollars. His wife accompanied him on the military flights, while other delegation members used commercial flights to Europe, the report said, adding that HHS said Price had reimbursed the agency for the cost of his wife's travel, without saying when. Politico said its review brought taxpayer payments for Price's travel to more than $1 million since May. The White House referred questions about Price's travel reimbursement to HHS. Price's announcement came a day after said he was displeased Trump ominously said, ""We'll see,"" when asked if he would fire Price, a medical doctor and ex-congressman who long railed against excessive spending by the federal government. ""I'm looking at that very closely. I am not happy with him,"" Trump said. Price earlier Thursday told reporters, ""I think we've still got the confidence of the president."" In a letter sent to Trump on Thursday, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, noted that ""federal regulations specifically prohibit official travel by chartered jet when it is not the most cost-effective mode of travel 'because the taxpayer should pay no more than necessary for your transportation.'"" Grassley asked Trump to urge his Cabinet secretaries to use ""reasonable and cost-effective modes of travel."" The senator noted that in addition to Price ""there are questions about the travel expenses of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin"" that are now under investigation by the inspectors general of both men's departments. Grassley asked the president to inform him of ""steps the administration has taken to ensure that cabinet secretaries use the most fiscally responsible travel in accordance with the public trust they hold."" BuzzFeed News reported Thursday that Price in the first two months of this year asked a White House official to tell Trump that he wanted to reopen HHS's executive dining room, which had been closed since George W. Bush was president. In his statement Thursday, Price wrote that he welcomes and is ""cooperating fully with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) review of processes and procedures related to my official travel as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. ""I have also taken the additional step of initiating a departmental review to determine if any changes or reforms are necessary. As I have previously stated, all of this travel was approved by legal and HHS officials,"" Price said. ""Despite this, I regret the concerns this has raised regarding the use of taxpayer dollars,"" Price said. ""All of my political career I've fought for the taxpayers. It is clear to me that in this case, I was not sensitive enough to my concern for the taxpayer. I know as well as anyone that the American people want to know that their hard-earned dollars are being spent wisely by government officials."" Price also said, ""I have spent forty years both as a doctor and in public service putting people first."" ""It has been my personal honor to serve the American people, and I look forward to continuing that service."" Price on Thursday morning attended a press conference in Washington, D.C., to promote flu vaccinations. He left that event without taking questions from reporters inside the National Press Club for the conference. The Democratic National Committe called Price's payment plan ""an insult to American taxpayers.'' ''Price wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money, but instead of reimbursing the full cost of his flights, he plans to return only a small fraction of what he spent for his seat on the plane,'' a DNC spokesman said. ''It's not just Price, though: Trump has consistently wasted taxpayer dollars on trips to his properties, and we've repeatedly seen headlines of other members of Trump's cabinet taking advantage of American taxpayers for their own gain. Trump is not fighting for the forgotten man; he is stealing from them.

2017-06-09 00:00:00,2017,6.0,9,Trump administration asks for input on reducing Obamacare burdens,"The woman who oversees Obamacare for the federal government is asking for ideas from the public on how to make that health-care law less of a ""burden."" The call for public comment on how to change Obamacare through regulatory moves comes at the same time as the Trump administration continues to push Congress to pass legislation that would repeal and replace key parts of the law. In a statement, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the request for information it will issue seeks ideas for how to make the rules about individual and small-group insurance markets more ""flexible"" and ""streamlined."" CMS' release on the request refers to ""reducing the regulatory burdens of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,"" the official name of Obamacare. ""Our goal ... is to identify and eliminate or change regulations that are outdated, unnecessary, or ineffective; [and] impose costs that exceed benefits,"" CMS said. As in other recent announcements by Trump administration health agencies, CMS highlighted problems with Obamacare markets. The agency noted that people who have obtained health coverage through Obamacare marketplaces ""are facing significant premium increases"" and are ""also dealing with fewer plans to choose from and a continuous stream of"" insurers exiting those marketplaces. CMS Administrator Seema Verma said, ""We are looking for valuable feedback on how to change existing regulations in ways that put patients first, promote greater consumer choice, enhance affordability and return more control over health care to the states."" The request for comment is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register on Monday. Members of the public will be able to make comments online for 30 days. CMS in recent months has made several other moves to tweak the Obamacare regulatory system. Those changes are not dependent on approval by Congress, which is considering a Republican-backed plan to change Obamacare by law. It is not clear now that the GOP will be able to pass such a plan this year. In April, CMS issued a final rule that it said will ""increase choices and encourage stability in the health insurance market for 2018."" That rule reduced the next annual open enrollment period in Obamacare individual plans by a month and a half. It will now run from Nov. 1 through Dec. 15. The rule also allows insurers to require customers to pay past-due back premiums before they enroll in a plan with the same insurer the following year, and requires people to submit supporting documents if they seek to sign up for health coverage during special enrollment periods outside of open enrollment. In May, CMS said it would remove a technical hurdle in how online insurance brokers sign up customers in plans sold on HealthCare.gov, the federal Obamacare marketplace that serves the majority of states. Also last month, CMS said it would propose that HealthCare.gov stop enrolling people in health plans available for businesses that have 50 or fewer full-time workers. CMS' proposal would allow HealthCare.gov to continue determining the eligibility of businesses for the Small Business Health Options Program. But those businesses would have to buy coverage for their workers from an insurance agent or broker, or directly from an insurance company. Although CMS has said it wants to encourage stability in the insurance market, critics of the Trump administration have accused it of trying to sabotage Obamacare markets. On Thursday, the insurance commissioner of Washington state said the administration and Congress have eroded confidence among the nation's insurers by calling for a repeal of Obamacare, and for refusing to guarantee billions of dollars in federal payments to insurers for key subsidies to low-income customers. Washington is losing two insurers in its Obamacare markets next year, and will see the number of individual health plans available to customers cut by more than half.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/09/trump-administration-asks-for-input-on-reducing-obamacare-burdens.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,630

2019-11-14 00:00:00,2019,11.0,14,"Apple Research app solicits volunteers for heart, hearing studies","Apple is launching a new app for consumers to sign up for up to three new medical studies. The app, dubbed Research, will be available to download via the Apple Store on Thursday. People can ask to participate in studies on heart, movement and hearing issues, and on women's health. Those who meet the criteria will be asked to stay involved for up to a decade. Apple has several major efforts underway in health, ranging from its Apple Watch, which monitors heart health and movement, to its employee health clinics. It has hired dozens of doctors in a wide range of specialties, and has seen some high-profile departures, as it slowly moves into the $3.5 trillion medical sector. CEO Tim Cook has gone as far as to say that it could be the company's ""greatest contribution"" to mankind. Each of the new studies is a bit different in its design and scope. The movement-oriented study, for instance, requires that participants also have an Apple Watch. It was designed with Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital and the American Heart Association and is intended to promote exercise and cardiovascular health, as well as to look warning signs for atrial fibrillation, which puts patients at greater risk for a stroke. The women's health study, which is hoping to better understand menstrual cycles and their relationship to a set of health conditions, requires participants to submit monthly surveys. The hearing study, which looks at the long-term impact of sound exposure, will send notifications to users when they're potentially hurting their hearing in loud environments. These studies are all designed to be digital, meaning that participants don't need to show up anywhere for testing. If the Apple Heart study is any indication, the company could see hundreds of thousands of sign-ups per study, although it remains to be seen whether participants will remain engaged for years. Apple has also outlined a detailed consent process, which might also put off some potential users. But the company presumably decided to move ahead with that to show that it takes privacy and security seriously. Apple, in a shift away from its policy of declining to comment on future projects, also tells people during sign-up that the research they participate in might inform future product design.

2020-01-10 00:00:00,2020,1.0,10,Top Google exec David Drummond is leaving the company ," (CNN)David Drummond, a longtime Google executive who most recently served as chief legal officer for parent company Alphabet (GOOGL), is retiring at the end of this month, according to a filing on Friday.  His departure comes amid a broader changing of the guard in the top ranks at Alphabet and follows scrutiny of the conduct of multiple high-ranking men at the company, including Drummond.  Drummond was mentioned in an explosive 2018 New York Times investigation into how the company allegedly protected male executives, some of whom engaged in inappropriate relationships with subordinates.  In August of last year, former Google employee Jennifer Blakely published a Medium post expanding on allegations that she had a years-long affair with Drummond. According to the Times, the affair began when she worked in the legal department and reported to one of his deputies.  Drummond, Blakely wrote in the post, was ""well aware"" that the relationship violated a Google policy ""discouraging"" and later ""outright banning"" relationships with direct reports. They had a child together. Blakely says she was then moved to a new department for which she had ""zero experience."" Drummond, by contrast, continued to climb up the company ladder. Google declined to comment on Blakely's account at the time. Drummond also did not respond to a request for comment. Buzzfeed obtained a statement from Drummond at the time that read, in part, ""It's not a secret that Jennifer and I had a difficult break-up 10 years ago. I am far from perfect and I regret my part in that."" He added: ""There are two sides to all of the conversations and details Jennifer recounts, and I take a very different view about what happened."" The allegations raised questions about whether Google prioritized protecting the powerful men at the top of the company over the women who were subordinate to them. In November, CNBC reported that Alphabet's board had opened an investigation into the handling of misconduct claims, including the behavior of Drummond. In response to those reports, an Alphabet spokesperson said at the time: ""As has already been confirmed in public court filings, in early 2019, Alphabet's Board of Directors formed a special litigation committee to consider claims made by shareholders in various lawsuits relating to past workplace conduct."" Despite the scrutiny, Drummond remained in the top ranks of the company -- until now. In a note circulated internally to colleagues on Friday, and provided to CNN Business, Drummond framed his decision to retire as coming in response to Google's two cofounders -- Larry Page and Sergey Brin -- recently stepping down as executives at Alphabet. Sundar Pichai, another longtime Google executive, is now CEO of both Google and Alphabet. ""With Larry and Sergey now leaving their executive roles at Alphabet, the company is entering an exciting new phase, and I believe that it's also the right time for me to make way for the next generation of leaders."" Forbes was first to report on the news. Drummond will not be receiving an exit package, the company told CNN Business.  During his nearly two decades at Google, Drummond had a key role in multiple parts of the business. He served as the company's first outside counsel before eventually rising to his role as senior vice president of corporate development as well as chief legal officer for Alphabet and Google. He also served as chairman of the company's venture capital arms, and served on the board of one of its best-known investments, Uber (UBER).

Were this 2015, 2014, 2013, or really most years between the birth of humans and/or snowboarding, you probably would have just given up and/or started driving toward a mountain. But this is 2016 and the future is bright: droneboarding is here. Droneboarding is the newly developed practice of using a drone to drag around someone on a snowboard. Last week, we lamented that the only available documentation of this great sport used both a small human (child) and a small drone (quadcopter). Fortunately, there is more: another video filmed in late January shows a standard-sized human (adult) being dragged around on a snowboard by a very large drone. It is excellent and everything you'd want out of an early droneboarding video. I say ""early"" because presumably there will be some much crazier stuff once this sport matures. Probably accidents, too! Everyone please be careful while droneboarding.

Investments in early stage digital companies have boomed in France in recent years, helped by tax cuts and business-friendly measures put in place by President Emmanuel Macron, who has vowed to turn the country into a “start-up nation”. “We’re announcing a specific plan to support the liquidity of start-ups,” O told French radio station Radio Classique. “In total it will be a plan for 4 billion (euros).” The money injected by venture capital funds into French start-ups jumped 30% over the first three quarters of 2019 from a year earlier to 3.9 billion euros, according Dealroom, a data provider. The French government’s liquidity plan for start-ups includes a short-term refinancing scheme (160 million euros), the early payment of some tax credits (1.5 billion), the accelerated payment of already-planned investments in the sector (250 million) and guarantees over cash flow costs (2 billion). “Given the global economic situation, there’s a risk that some investors may become wary,” O said, adding that he would meet some venture capital funds this week in a bid to shore up their support for French startups.

The company said the breach did not happen due to a hack but occurred as the database was incorrectly configured. The database did not include any passwords or financial details and was accessible from April 2019 until Feb. 28, 2020, it added. The database, however, included limited contact information such as names, home and email addresses and phone numbers. Virgin Media CEO Lutz Schuler said the company recently became aware of the issue and immediately shut down access to the affected database.

Enter GYENNO's Smart Spoon, a stabilization utensil device that offsets 85 percent of unwanted tremors for users affected by diseases like Parkinson's. The spoon, which has been in development for nine months, was on display at the Consumer Electronics Showcase in Las Vegas this week. Dehuai Li, marketing officer at GYENNO, told Motherboard hundreds of people are already using the technology in China. The tool works with sophisticated stabilization control algorithms and motion learning technology to learn the frequency of the tremors and adjust to them, making it possible for users to eat normally. A full charge lasts three hours––plenty of time for a normal meal––and the battery can be swapped out easily. In addition to stabilizing the spoon so users can eat normally, the device also collects data on the frequency and other information about the tremor that can be shared with medical professionals. The GYENNO Spoon is similar to another robotic spoon from Lift Labs, which has been relatively off-the-radar since Google purchased it in 2014. Li said GYENNO now has a global patent on the technology in its spoon, and the company believes its gadget is the best on the market. A representative from GYENNO told Motherboard the spoon has several key differences from Lift's, which is also patented. ""We use special PID [proportional–integral–derivative controller] control technology and attitude stabilization technology to make a better performance, higher frequency response and more accurate position control,"" he said. That makes [GYENNO Spoon] 85 percent tremor canceling while Liftware just 75 percent."" GYENNO Spoon has several hundred users currently, many of which have uploaded their improvements to Chinese social media site Weibo, saying it has greatly improved their ability to eat, Li said. ""You want to feed yourself, you don't want someone else to feed you,"" he said. ""It improves your confidence and dignity. Many of these diseases have no cure, so we want to improve the quality of life."" The smart spoon and fork retails for $300 and will be released on Amazon in the coming weeks.

At the core of the ethereum network are miners, people who use their computing hardware to solve complicated math problems in exchange for ether, the cryptocurrency native to the ethereum network. Ether is kind of like bitcoin, but rather than existing solely as a peer-to-peer payment system, it can also be used to fuel decentralized applications, or dapps, that run on the ethereum network. Ether has garnered a lot of attention this year after its value rose to a peak of $400, an increase of 4000 percent since January. The meteoric rise of the crypto asset has also fueled something of a gold rush for people looking to get in on the action by becoming miners. This requires building a custom computer from scratch, which isn't quite as hard as it sounds—if you can find the graphics cards that are at the heart of the computer, that is. In this how-to video, I'll be walking you through the step-by-step instructions for building an ethereum mining rig from the ground up.

An object of fascination ever since Clyde Tombaugh discovered it in 1930, the Plutonian system was at last brought into sharp focus, and the results were electrifying. To the delight of its many ardent fans, the dwarf planet turned out to boast several unusual surface features, including a bright, heart-shaped region of plains. Stretching 1,000 miles across, it is now known as the Tombaugh Regio. ""New Horizons not only completed the era of first reconnaissance of the planets, the mission has intrigued and inspired,"" said Jim Green, NASA's director of planetary science, in a Thursday statement. ""Who knew that Pluto would have a heart?"" he added. ""Even today, New Horizons captures our imagination, rekindles our curiosity, and reminds us of what's possible."" To celebrate the flyby's first birthday, NASA released a concept video that imagines what a lander might see if it approached the distant world, and descended to its surface. Compiled from over 100 New Horizon snapshots, the virtual trip zooms in on its target touchdown site at the edge of Tombaugh Regio. While the resolution doesn't allow for a particularly detailed look at the Plutonian surface, the short simulation is a tantalizing glimpse of potential landing missions to the farflung system in the future. After all, New Horizons may have been the first spacecraft to pay Pluto and its moons a visit, but it would be a shame if it were the last.

2017-06-09 12:00:00,2017,6.0,9,Low-Salt Diets May Be Sensitizing Us to Addiction," Let's assume that you've just had your tonsils removed, or that you hurt your back and have been prescribed opiate medications such as hydrocodone or oxycodone to treat the pain. Or perhaps your child has been prescribed Adderall for the treatment of ADHD. What if I told you that following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's low-salt guidelines—that is, consuming less than one teaspoon of salt per day, a recommendation that they put forth to basically all healthy Americans—could be placing you or your loved ones at risk of becoming addicted to these medications? Or what if this low-salt advice was predisposing you to sugar addiction? What if you were deficient in salt even if you weren't consciously restricting your sodium? We all love salt. Just a pinch can make almost any food savory and delicious. But sometimes salt can taste even better than usual, even more rewarding. This occurs when we become salt depleted (also known as salt deficient). If your daily habits include drinking three cups or more of coffee, working out for an hour, or taking medications that are diuretics (including many blood pressure meds), then you could be in a state of salt deficit, even if you don't limit your salt intake. And if you're one of the 25 percent of Americans who has been advised to follow a low-salt diet, whether because of high blood pressure or kidney disease, then you are very possibly in a state of deficit. Very simply, salt depletion enhances our liking for salt. Without this enhanced liking, we might not ever seek it out and eat more of it during times of need. But a salt deficit might not merely sensitize the brain to the effects of salt; it also sensitizes the brain to other substances, such as certain drugs (cocaine), and medications (amphetamines, such as Adderall, and opiates, such as morphine). Even refined sugar may now be even more rewarding, and thus more addictive. There is good evidence to back up this idea: Sodium balance is an evolutionary adaptation that is tightly regulated for sustaining life for all vertebrates. Because of this, sodium depletion stimulates an increased salt ""appetite"" in which animals and humans will seek out salt and consume more of it. This behavior (seeking-out and bingeing) resembles that which occurs in those who are addicted to drugs of abuse. An enhanced reward from salt during salt depletion is a survival mechanism that may now be working against us, as the changes that occur in the brain during sodium depletion mimic that of repeated drug use. More From VICE: Munchies: Cal Elliott The myth that salt is addictive, and that the more you eat the higher your tolerance, doesn't reflect the historical data on salt consumption. Indeed, we used to consume up to ten times as much salt as we do today. Our ancestors consumed so much more salt than contemporary humans because it was their main method of food preservation. (Now that the fridge has replaced salt as the main food preservative, we consume much less sodium than we used to.) What's remarkable is that when a population has free access to salt—when its consumption isn't impacted by either by scarcity, conscious restriction, or on the flip side, use as a preservative—intake consistently lands at three to five grams of sodium per day. It doesn't rise above that level, suggesting that our tolerance or cravings for salt do not go up the more we eat. This suggests that our bodies, not an addiction, control our salt intake. And for the last 8,000 years, we have been consuming a diet higher in salt than we do today. Furthermore, data shows that salt depletion sensitizes the dopamine system, which is implicated in drug cravings. Sodium depletion has been found to cross-sensitize with amphetamine (a drug known to cross-sensitize with cocaine. Cross-sensitization is a phenomenon that occurs between drugs of abuse, where the use of one drug leads to enhanced effects (and increased abuse potential) of the other. But in this case, sodium depletion, rather than a drug of abuse, is increasing the reward and abuse potential. Periods of enhanced salt liking only last until the depletion has been corrected, and once corrected, inhibitory signals will turn off the ""liking"" and turn on the ""aversion"" signal. This is what I like to refer to as our ""salt thermostat,"" the system by which our body controls our salt intake to ensure optimal health and survival. It seems that the low-salt guidelines could be 'priming' or 'sensitizing' our brains for an excessive reward from refined sugar and drugs of abuse. Almost 30,000 people die in the United States every year from overdosing on prescription opioids, cocaine, and heroin (this number is rising at an alarming rate). If there is a possibility that some of these overdose deaths could be linked to the low-salt guidelines, it may be time to revisit this advice. Salt deficit is also fairly common. In those with chronic kidney disease (affecting an estimated 31 million people in the United States), the prevalence of low blood levels of sodium is as high as 30 percent. And around 3 to 6 million people in the United States are diagnosed with hyponatremia, or low sodium levels in the blood, every year. Hyponatremia is also very common in those with heart failure and in the elderly. Sodium depletion early in life (e.g., in utero or shortly after birth) from a pregnant mother adhering to low-salt advice can also predispose children to become addicted to sugar and drugs of abuse. Indeed, salt depletion during these susceptible times seems to chronically activate the salt-liking reward system. While more research is needed to advance this idea, this is just another reason why we should be skeptical of the advice to consciously restrict our salt intake—other reasons including the dubious connection between salt and blood pressure levels, the impact of sodium restriction on weight, among others. The low-salt guidelines, which began in 1977 with the release of the first US dietary goals, should not supersede salt appetite, which developed over 100 million years of evolution. When it comes to salt intake, our body and brain probably know best. Eating the level of salt that our body drives us to consume, rather than trying to consciously restrict our salt intake (as the low-salt guidelines would have us do) will help ensure that we avoid salt deficit. And if you suspect you may be low in salt because of overtraining at the gym, your insatiable coffee habit, or use of medications, see a doctor. Otherwise, take these guidelines with—well, you know.

2017-12-22 00:00:00,2017,12.0,22,New Ohio law prevents abortions in Down syndrome cases," (CNN)Ohio is prohibiting doctors from performing abortions in cases where tests reveal the fetus has or likely has Down syndrome. Republican Gov. John Kasich signed the legislation Friday and the law goes into effect in 90 days. ""The governor is pro-life and supports policies that protect the sanctity of life,"" press secretary Jon Keeling tells CNN.  The law prohibits abortions after prenatal tests reveal Down syndrome in a fetus or if there's ""any other reason to believe"" the fetus has the genetic condition. A person performing an abortion in such a case could face a fourth-degree felony charge, and physicians could lose their licenses. The woman seeking the abortion would not be held accountable, according to the legislation. Similar laws have passed in North Dakota and Indiana, though a federal judge blocked the Indiana law. The North Dakota law went into effect in 2013. Down syndrome is a genetic condition that affects cognitive ability, causing mild to severe learning disabilities and distinctive facial characteristics. The condition can be diagnosed during pregnancy through prenatal screening tests. Treatment can include speech, occupational, emotional and other therapies; supplements and drugs; and assistive devices. 'It is an issue of discrimination' Anti-abortion advocates praised the new law. ""Now that the Down Syndrome Non-Discrimination Act is law, unborn babies prenatally diagnosed with Down syndrome are given a shot at life,"" said Mike Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life. ""Ohio is and will continue to be a state that sees the lives of people with Down syndrome as lives worth living, thanks to this legislation."" Ohio Rep. Sarah LaTourette, a Republican who introduced the House bill last month, said it's not an abortion issue, but rather an issue of discrimination.  ""A diagnosis of Down syndrome for your unborn child can be devastating and life-changing. Not everyone is equipped to handle this lifelong commitment, but thankfully, as you can see, there are now many options available to families,"" she said before the Senate voted on the bill last week. ""I believe that life begins at conception and that abortion should never be considered an option. However, regardless of if you agree with me or not, I hope that you can see that this is not an issue about abortion; it is an issue of discrimination -- discriminating against a person, not allowing them their God-given right to life, simply because they might have Down syndrome."" 'What is needed is information, not restrictions' The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio condemned the legislation, saying it would interfere with women's rights to make personal decisions. The group had called for Kasich to veto the bill.   ""We should never force any woman to become a parent against her will or question her decisions about pregnancy. We don't know her circumstances. Shame on our legislators for judging anyone else's decision about something as important as whether to become a parent,"" said Gary Daniels, chief lobbyist for the ACLU of Ohio. ""We urge Gov. Kasich to do the right thing for Ohio women and families and veto this dangerous legislation.""  Emily Chesnut, a mother of four from Cincinnati, became a Down syndrome activist after her 6-year-old daughter was diagnosed with the condition. She said she's against the law. ""I think they are using Down syndrome as a face to restrict women from having abortions,"" Chesnut said. She believes that women should have the right to make their own medical decisions and that this bill confuses that issue.   Information is what people need when it comes to Down syndrome, she said. ""I think people who are on both sides would agree we need more information. It's scary when you hear your child is not perfect, but accurate information is the most important,"" said Chesnut, who previously promoted a bill that required the Ohio Department of Health to have up-to-date Down syndrome information. When there is a diagnosis, ""what is needed is information, not restrictions,"" she said.

2019-03-20 00:00:00,2019,3.0,20,Kale joins the ranks of the 'Dirty Dozen' pesticide list," (CNN)Kale, that popular green of the health conscious, has joined the ignoble list of 12 fruits and vegetables with the most pesticide residues, according to the Environmental Working Group. The last time kale was on the list was in 2009 when it was ranked eighth. Strawberries and spinach took the top two spots again this year, respectively, followed by kale. Since 2004, the group -- a nonprofit, nonpartisan environmental organization -- has annually ranked pesticide contamination in popular fruits and vegetables for its Shopper's Guide, noting those with the highest and lowest concentration of pesticides after being washed or peeled. Pesticides include an array of chemicals that kill unwanted insects, plants, molds and rodents. These chemicals keep pests from destroying produce but also expose humans to residues through their diet. This guide shares the results of the 47 tested fruits and vegetables, so consumers can buy foods with lower amounts of pesticides.  The ""Dirty Dozen"" and ""Clean Fifteen,"" a list of the top 15 tested produce contaminated with the least amounts of pesticide, are based off more than 40,900 fruit and vegetable samples tested by the Food and Drug Administration and the United States Department of Agriculture. The types and amounts of pesticides used vary based upon pests and weather, according to EWG. Analysis of recent data showed that 70% of this produce sold for consumption contained pesticide residues.  How do pesticides impact health? While pesticides are used to protect growing fruits and vegetables, they can also endanger humans, per the World Health Organization. Human consumption of pesticides has been shown by studies to be associated with cancer risk, fertility and other health concerns. EWG research analyst Carla Burns explained in statement, ""The main route of pesticide exposure for most Americans who do not live or work on or near farms is through their diet."" By helping consumers know what foods to be more health-conscious about or to gravitate toward in the grocery store, this guide intends to assist making decisions about the way pesticide regulation impacts health.  Fear shouldn't be a part of the decision whether to buy foods on the pesticide list, said Teresa Thorne, executive director of the Alliance for Food and Farming, a non-profit that represents organic and conventional farmers of fruits and vegetables. Thorne noted a past study in the Journal of Toxicology that was critical of EWG's Dirty Dozen list, and found that eating organic produce didn't decrease consumer risk. ""That's largely because residues are so low, if present at all,"" she said. Research on the effects of pesticides on humans is ongoing, and there is not a complete understanding of whether there is a particular amount of pesticides considered to be safe. The American Academy of Pediatrics acknowledges there are reasons to be concerned about the exposure of developing children to pesticides, especially before birth. Concerns include effects on development and behavior.  What produce has high amounts of pesticides on the list? In order of pesticide concentration, 2019's Dirty Dozen list is: strawberries, spinach, kale, nectarines, apples, grapes, peaches, cherries, pears, tomatoes, celery and potatoes. Among these, kale and spinach contained 1.1 to 1.8 times more pesticide residue in weight than other batches of produce. This list varies, as does pesticide use in agriculture. ""The types and amount of pesticides a grower uses is going to depend upon the pests that the grower is dealing with and the weather.  Wetter weather will often increase the use of fungicides,"" says Chris Campbell, EWG's vice president for information technology. Despite the high pesticide residues of spinach and kale, strawberries have maintained their place at the top of the Dirty Dozen list. Strawberries are popular -- Americans eat an estimated 8 pounds per year -- but the chemicals used to protect and preserve strawberries raise concern and some have been banned by the European Union. The fruit gained its notorious status because of the United States Department of Agriculture concluding strawberries are most likely, among the tested produce, to retain pesticide residues even after being picked and washed.  What is so surprising about kale being number three on the Dirty Dozen list? Kale is known for being a source of vitamins and other nutrients, but the vegetable could also be tainted by cancer-causing pesticides. The report's results showed that 92% of the samples of conventionally grown kale were positive for two or more pesticide residues, and a single sample of kale sometimes contained as many as 18 different pesticide residues. The most common pesticide detected was Dacthal, also known as DCPA, and has been identified as a potential cancer-causing agent. Europe has prohibited its use since 2009.  What produce has low amounts of pesticides? Produce that are among the top of the list for reducing the exposure of consumers to pesticides include avocados, sweet corn, pineapples, frozen sweet peas and onions. In contrast to the Dirty Dozen, there was no detection of pesticide residues in 70% of these foods. Less than 1% of avocados and sweet corn tested positive for pesticides and were considered the cleanest of the list.  How can you avoid pesticides? The recommendations from the Environmental Working Group are to buy and eat organic produce, especially fruits and vegetables found on the Dirty Dozen list. However, if your budget does not allow you to eat organic, fruits and vegetables are better than none.  ""The science shows that what people need to know is to eat more fruits and vegetables every day, conventional or organic,  choose either. No list needed,"" said Thorne of the Alliance for Food and Farming. ",https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/20/health/dirty-dozen-pesticide-list/index.html,health,CNN,health,925

More than 70 job listings went live in the past month on the company's site relating to its maps team, or requiring skills around things like: ""geospatial information services,"" ""navigational aids"" and ""fleet management."" That's a lot of hiring around one discipline even for a juggernaut like Apple. Adding more map-tech talent to its ranks won't just help the company make Apple Maps more competitive with Google Maps. The new hires could also help deliver on two big promises: to become an important player in augmented reality and ""autonomous systems."" After beating Wall Street estimates in its on Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview with CNBC's Josh Lipton, ""The smart phone is becoming even more important to people because it's going across so much of your life... With things like AR… I think it becomes even more essential than it currently is."" Augmented reality apps, such as Pokemon Go or Snap Lenses, display data, digital stickers or game characters over an image of a real environment as it's being captured by a user's iPhone or other device. AR apps require precise location awareness to work well. Android's operating system remains more popular, worldwide, than iOS. And Facebook has announced it wants to become a dominant AR platform. Ensuring that AR apps work brilliantly on iPads and iPhones could help Apple fend off the competition, and keep developers on its own app store. Apple released an AR Kit for developers in June to leap ahead in this emerging area of technology. Improving and developing new map capabilities could also, obviously, help Apple finally come out with ""core technology"" for the self-driving car market. On Tuesday's earnings call, Cook said, ""We are very focused on autonomous systems from a core technology point of view.

2019-04-24 00:00:00,2019,4.0,24,U.S. compliance startup Chainalysis expands tracking service to 10 cryptocurrencies,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York-based startup Chainalysis said on Wednesday it has expanded its real-time transaction monitoring service to cover 10 cryptocurrencies as part of an initiative to help reduce global anti-money laundering activities. The launch of additional cryptocurrencies comes as investors await global regulatory guidance that will require automated transaction monitoring for cryptocurrencies that exchanges and financial institutions support, the company said in a statement. Chainalysis helps law enforcement, regulators and businesses including banks track flows of cryptocurrency to spot illicit activity. Since a decentralized currency system like bitcoin is not governed by any entity or regulator, it is susceptible to illegal activities such as money laundering. Starting on Wednesday, Chainalysis customers can track Binance coin, Gemini dollar, Tether, and USD coin on Chainalysis KYT (Know Your Transaction), the firm’s anti-money laundering service. Over the past year, the company also rolled out support for ether, bitcoin cash, litecoin, trueUSD, and Paxos standard, in addition to its original bitcoin capabilities. “We have been investing for the last year to re-architect our entire platform to support multiple blockchains in the face of global regulation,” Jonathan Levin, co-founder and chief operating officer of Chainalysis, told Reuters in an interview. “Global regulation of the cryptocurrency industry is inevitable for this truly borderless financial system to achieve mainstream adoption,” he added. Levin noted that inter-governmental and domestic entities will provide clarity on the regulation of virtual assets including cryptocurrencies this year. And one of the recommendations is that companies automate the monitoring and processing of transactions, he said. Chainalysis recently raised $6 million in funding from Japanese financial group Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc and venture capital firm Sozo Ventures. The investment follows a $30 million fundraising round from venture firms Accel and Benchmark in February.

The app doesn’t read temperature for you, or even connect to a thermometer to ensure accurate readings. Rather, it reminds users throughout the day to use a conventional thermometer to log information about their temperature, medications, lifestyle and health.

2016-08-07 18:46:27,2016,8.0,7,Amazon Has Big Plans for Alexa: Running the ‘Star Trek’ Home,"SEATTLE — Amazon surprised a lot of people when its Echo, a $180 so-called smart speaker, became a hit, giving them a novel way to play music, turn on the lights in their homes and set thermostats with voice commands. Amazon, though, has much bigger plans for the technology behind Echo. It wants the Alexa Voice Service, which powers Echo, to be an ingredient in devices around the home and beyond, even if they aren’t made by Amazon. The vision of an omnipresent intelligent assistant is one Amazon shares, in one form or another, with most other big technology companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft. Along with a handful of start-ups, these companies see their intelligent assistants as powerful new ways for users to interact with devices and internet services — just as smartphone touch screens were. Many technology specialists think that people will be O.K. with a single intelligent assistant in their lives but that most won’t have the patience to regularly use two or three of them, each with its individual quirks. As a result, each company is racing to weave its assistant into as many devices and services as possible. Amazon, for example, wants Alexa to be a part of products like Nucleus, a smart-intercom system with a touch screen and a camera that went on sale last week for $249 (or $199 each if you buy two or three at once). Nucleus owners can have Alexa play music and read a weather forecast through the device. In a phone interview, Jonathan Frankel, the chief executive of Nucleus, said that adding Alexa to Nucleus was a no-brainer because it made the device far more useful. “We’re taking $180 worth of utility and adding it into a $200 device,” he said. So far, a handful of smaller companies have released or promised to release products with Alexa built into them. There’s Triby, a portable speaker; CoWatch, a smartwatch; and Pebble Core, a wireless wearable device by the maker of the Pebble smartwatch. Ford Motor is working with Amazon to integrate Alexa into its vehicles so drivers can control smart-home features like lights, thermostats and security systems from their cars. Over 10,000 developers have registered to integrate Alexa into their products, Amazon said. It won’t say how many Echo units it has sold, except to say that millions of devices with Alexa in them have been purchased. John MacFarlane, the chief executive of Sonos, another well-known device maker, hinted in a blog post this year that Sonos was working on a way to play music through its speakers using Alexa voice control. In an interview this spring, David Limp, Amazon’s senior vice president for devices, said that the company wanted there to be as many Alexa-linked “endpoints” around the home as possible and that Amazon did not really care who made those devices. Amazon has expanded its lineup of devices that use Alexa with its Echo Dot, a miniature version of the Echo speaker, and Amazon Tap, a portable Bluetooth speaker. “The longer-term vision is a little bit like the ‘Star Trek’ computer,” Mr. Limp said. “Captain Kirk or Picard could sit on the bridge and ask anything and get the right answer.” But while Amazon has made a lot of progress in this regard, it may have a hard time extending Alexa’s reach outside the home because of its weaknesses in mobile technology, analysts say. The success of Echo has been described as a redemption of sorts for Amazon after it suffered a brutal defeat in the smartphone market with its Fire Phone, which the company stopped selling after poor sales — a misstep that has left Amazon vulnerable. Apple and Google have clear advantages over Amazon because of their dominant positions in the mobile market. And they are pushing their versions of Alexa — Siri and Google’s assistant — as ways to control other devices throughout the home. Apple has a technology called HomeKit that allows people to control thermostats, light switches and other devices with Siri from Apple devices. Google has announced plans for an Echo-like home speaker called Google Home. As intelligent assistants improve in quality, Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, thinks people will want these virtual helpers to follow them all day like a companion. “What you want from an assistant is that they are always available to you everywhere,” he said. While Amazon could eventually give people access to Alexa’s functions through apps on smartphones (a couple of apps from independent developers do this already), Mr. Dawson is skeptical that Amazon will be able to make them work as well as assistants more deeply integrated into smartphones by Apple and Google. “They’re basically absent on smartphones, which are devices we take everywhere we go,” he said.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/technology/amazon-has-big-plans-for-alexa-running-the-star-trek-home.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,795
2016-11-30 00:00:00,2016,11.0,30,Knowing personalized risk for diabetes may not change lifestyles,"(Reuters Health) - Giving people detailed information about their personal genetic risk of developing diabetes may not inspire them to change their behavior any more than just giving them basic facts about the disease, a recent study suggests. “Overall, genetic risk information is becoming more and more common, and it’s reasonable to assume that given the decreases in sequencing costs genetic risk information will proliferate,” said lead study author Dr. Job Godino of the University of California, San Diego. The big question, though, is whether genetic information can get people to take action, Godino added by email. “For common complex disorders like diabetes, it very well may not do so,” Godino said. Globally, about one in nine adults have diabetes, and the disease will be the seventh leading cause of death by 2030, according to the World Health Organization. Most of these people have Type 2, or adult-onset, diabetes, which happens when the body can’t properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy. To see if offering people more personalized information about their diabetes risk might help with prevention, researchers analyzed data on 569 men and women born in England between 1950 and 1965 who didn’t have a diagnosis of diabetes or other chronic diseases. Researchers looked at the participants’ individual risk of developing type 2 diabetes two ways. First, they collected blood samples from the participants to screen for gene variants. They also looked at what’s known as phenotypic risk based on things like age and weight. All of the participants received standard lifestyle advice on preventing diabetes. In addition, researchers randomly assigned a third of the people in the study to get information on their genetic risk for diabetes and another third to get information on their phenotypic risk. Eight weeks later, participants were fitted with a device to monitor physical activity for six days. Compared to the control group of people who didn’t receive detailed information about their personal diabetes risk, participants who did get their personal risk information didn’t end up getting significantly more exercise, researchers report in PLoS Medicine. However, the patients who were given their personalized risk of developing diabetes did have a better understanding of risk at the conclusion of the study. Limitations of the study include the lack of diversity among participants, who were generally well-educated and physically and psychologically healthy, the authors point out. This may make the results less relevant to a broader population of patients with diabetes or people at risk for developing the disease. The short follow-up period also limits the authors’ ability to know what the effect of having personal risk information might be over the longer term, they note. More research is needed to shed light on whether these results hold true for personalized risk information as it relates to other diseases and whether someone’s perception of their risk before the study had any impact on the outcome, the authors add. “The study did not observe that relaying that information changed their short-term behavior,” said Laura Rosella, a public health researcher at the University of Toronto who wasn’t involved in the study. “Therefore from the clinical perspective, or from the perspective of motivation behavior change, there does not appear to be a benefit to carrying out these tests for diabetes prevention,” Rosella added by email.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,2019,3.0,6,"As measles spreads, study finds no link between vaccine and autism","There's no link between autism and the vaccine that prevents measles, mumps and rubella, according to a new study that challenges a push by some parents against vaccinating their children. The study in Denmark is one of the largest research projects examining the issue. It comes as states face measles outbreaks that many health officials are blaming on the so-called anti-vaxxer movement. ""The study strongly supports that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination,"" the authors wrote in the study published this week in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Researchers studied over 650,000 children born in Denmark from 1999 through 2010 and used Danish population registries to gather information on vaccinations, autism diagnoses and other risk factors, such as if the child had a sibling diagnosed with autism. Children who were vaccinated were not more susceptible to autism and did not develop it at a higher rate than children who were not. Among those studied, 6,517 children were diagnosed with autism over the next decade. ""Vaccine hesitancy is increasing,"" study author Dr. Anders Hviid said in an email. ""Today, we are seeing the results in the form of more and more measles outbreaks in Europe and the U.S."" Researchers also said vaccines did not increase the risk of developing autism among children who had siblings with the disorder. The study comes as public health officials and lawmakers are increasingly calling on parents to get their children vaccinated. The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 159 cases of measles in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington state. The largest outbreak is in the Pacific Northwest, prompting Washington Gov. Jay Inslee to declare a state of emergency. Lawmakers are looking into changing lax vaccine exemption laws as a way to fight the epidemic. A Senate committee held its second hearing on the matter Tuesday, focusing on preventable disease outbreaks. Social media platforms have also been making changes. YouTube has stopped some anti-vaccine videos from showing ads, Pinterest has blocked searches on vaccinations and Amazon Prime video has pulled anti-vaccination documentaries from its roster. ""I think again we need to be looking at how do we get to the hearts and minds of people around vaccines and not put science on the shelf. We need to have this national conversation and campaign that is based on evidence,"" Washington state Secretary of Health Dr. John Wiesman said during the Senate hearing.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/06/as-measles-spreads-study-finds-no-link-between-vaccine-and-autism.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,425

2017-08-03 00:00:00,2017,8.0,3,Activision Blizzard's FY forecasts get a lift from 'Overwatch',"(Reuters) - Activision Blizzard Inc raised its full-year adjusted revenue and profit forecasts for the second time on Thursday, as the videogame publisher benefits from higher digital sales and the popularity of its multi-player futuristic game “Overwatch”. The company raised its full-year adjusted profit to $2 per share from $1.88 per share and its adjusted revenue forecast to $6.58 billion from $6.33 billion. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $2.02 per share and revenue of $6.54 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Activision also forecast current-quarter adjusted revenue of $1.70 billion, above analysts’ average estimate of $1.65 billion. The company expects to release its highly-anticipated “Destiny 2” on Sept. 6 for consoles. Activision said on Thursday pre-orders for “Destiny 2” are now above the 2014 game. Activision’s results cap a strong quarter for videogame makers including rivals Electronic Arts and Take Two Interactive, despite not launching a major game in the period. Activision said on Thursday it delivered nearly $1 billion of in-game revenues in the quarter. The company’s net income rose to $243 million, or 32 cents per share, in the second-quarter ended June 30 from $151 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue from the company’s high-margin digital business rose 14.7 percent to $1.31 billion, underscoring the shift among players to buy and download games online. Activision’s total adjusted revenue fell 11.9 percent to $1.42 billion, from $1.61 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $1.23 billion. In the year-earlier period, the company benefited from the launch of “Overwatch” in May 2016, as well as its acquisition of “Candy Crush” maker King Digital for nearly $6 billion.

2016-08-15 00:00:00,2016,8.0,15,Why the Pentagon is paying nearly $2 million for a custom-designed bacteria,"Not all start-ups are built on the internet. Boston-based Ginkgo Bioworks, for one, is creating new bacteria, and is now working on a vaccine to protect people from the ""bad"" bacteria that causes ailments like antibiotic-resistant infections and traveler's diarrhea. An illness like Traveler's diarrhea might be just a pesky annoyance to some, but to the U.S. Department of Defense it's a significant problem. It can severely hamper soldiers' field operations, and thus the DOD has given Ginko $1.75 million to make a vaccine, said Patrick Boyle, head of design at Ginkgo Bioworks. ""You take 100,000 people and move them to new country, a significant percentage of that group will get sick with traveler's diarrhea,"" said Boyle. ""That happens to be a disease that is a disruption of your gut microbiome by bad bacteria."" Ginkgo's probiotic vaccine — currently in the very early stages of development — will vaccinate bacteria that live in the human gut, which houses more than a trillion organisms. In doing so, it will provide immunity against diseases and ailments not covered by traditional vaccines. (Traditional vaccines address the immune system.) Within the next year, the company will evaluate whether it has the right proof of concept to begin testing whether it would work in mice, for example. The DOD's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has given Ginkgo a total of $5 million for various projects. The company, which is a CNBC 2016 Disruptor 50, has also gotten grants from the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation and the Small Business Innovation Research program. Private investors, who have given the company $154 million, include Allen & Co., Baillie Gifford and Cascade Investment Group. ""A lot of the hard basic biology that we are doing as far as this DARPA work, helps us to find better ways to engineer microbes in general,"" said Boyle. ""All the markets we are in and looking at are markets that are accessed by engineering microbes to do something."" Gingko also has commercial customers, including French fragrance maker Robertet, and Japanese flavor company Ajinomoto. Other partnerships cover cosmetics, nutritional ingredients, beverage, agriculture and specialty enzymes. The company plans to announce new partnerships by early September. ""What we are really interested [in] is making the process of engineering microbes more predictable,"" he said. ""That's why we get excited about these very hard, different types of projects — it allows us to discover some fundamental biology that helps us make that product more predictable."" For example, in developing a very precise bacterial vaccine, Ginkgo is also developing ways to create very precise bacterial sensors, said Boyle. Electronic devices, like smartphones and smartwatches, rely on sensors to do things like track the number of stairs the user has climbed or monitor heart rate. ""Biological sensors are likely to add capabilities to the sensors that are embedded in a lot of the electronic devices,"" said Boyle. ""To sense and respond to changes in your environment."" As such, a more sophisticated smartphone of the future could incorporate biological sensors to deliver new smart services and features. Bioremediation — the introduction of microorganisms to clean up pollutants — is another area of opportunity, said Boyle. Though using bacteria to clean up toxic soil sounds very different than delivering a vaccine, biologically, the process happens to use many of the same mechanisms, said Boyle. For some people, the idea of engineering microbes to produce vaccines or synthetic fragrances and flavors raises a lot of questions. The addition of military funding may further heighten fears around the applications of such technology. As such, consumers and stakeholders of the products Ginkgo is creating deserve to be involved in the discussion about how they should be designed and used, said Boyle. ""We try to be as open as possible about the products that we are working on and considering because we think that process is important,"" he said. ""We want people to understand the products that we're making.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/15/why-the-pentagon-is-paying-nearly-2-million-for-a-custom-designed-bacteria.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,657
2019-07-12 00:00:00,2019,7.0,12,Surgeries to help newborns nurse may have become too common,"(Reuters Health) - Minor surgery to help newborns latch on and nurse may have become too common, a new study suggests. More than 60% of babies referred to a specialty center for tongue-tie surgery, or frenotomy, did not need the operation, researchers report in JAMA Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery. Sometimes the procedure is truly needed, study coauthor Dr. Christopher Hartnick told Reuters Health. “But we were struck by how these procedures were becoming more and more common,” said Hartnick, a professor at the Harvard Medical School and director of the Pediatric Airway, Voice and Swallowing Center at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston. “When a newborn is having trouble feeding, you have to start asking questions as to why and whether there is a feeding disorder and if there are strategies that can help avoid surgery.” In children referred for tongue-tie surgery, a tissue called the lingual frenulum connects the tongue too tightly to the floor of the mouth, restricting the tongue’s movement. A different procedure, called lip tether surgery, is sometimes done when the frenulum of the upper lip connects it too tightly to the gums. “The newborn’s task is to breathe and feed,” Hartnick said. “To feed they need to form a seal with their mouths around the nipple of the mother or a bottle. If the upper lip doesn’t form the seal because it’s tied too tight to the gum line or the tongue is tied too tight to the floor of the mouth, the baby has an anatomic reason for having trouble feeding. Releasing those little tethers allows the lip to come forward or the tongue to move.” Often, however, there are a combination of factors getting in the way of nursing, Hartnick said. “While our study is small, it casts light on the fact that more and more parents who have just given birth are being told their child needs a surgical procedure for which there is not an enormous amount of outcome data on how often it works and what are the risks and what are other possible interventions,” he said. “And the number being done has skyrocketed over the last five or 10 years.” In fact, an analysis of the Kids’ Inpatient Database in the United States found a 10-fold increase in tongue-tie surgeries between 1997 and 2012, Hartnick and colleagues noted. Prompted by those rising rates, they formed a multidisciplinary feeding evaluation program at their center. Each mother-newborn pair met with a pediatric speech-language pathologist who evaluated breast feeding issues and then offered feedback and strategies to help. For the new study, Hartnick’s team examined the records of 115 newborns referred for tongue-tie surgery who underwent evaluation by the multidisciplinary team. The team concluded that 62.6% of the babies did not need surgery to fix breastfeeding issues. Hartnick advises parents who are told their baby needs tongue-tie surgery or lip-tether surgery to ask questions. “They may feel uncomfortable asking questions and some newborns may need a procedure but it’s best to arm yourself with the facts,” he said. The new study emphasizes the need to look at all the options when a newborn is having trouble breastfeeding, said Dr. Jonathan Walsh, an assistant professor of otolaryngology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. “When a diagnosis of tongue tie comes up in the setting of breastfeeding difficulty, it helps to have a sense that the provider is critically analyzing things and is taking the time to consider all the options,” said Walsh, who was not involved in the new research. “In the context of the exponential growth of these procedures, studies like this one help us, as a medical community and society, to cautiously put the brakes on,” Walsh said. “While in general these surgeries are very safe and have a very low rate of complications, it’s not zero. You can have severe bleeding, infections and injuries to the saliva ducts.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2XNumHQ JAMA Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery, online July 11, 2019.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-breastfeeding-tongue-tie/surgeries-to-help-newborns-nurse-may-have-become-too-common-idUSKCN1U72CK,Health News,Reuters,health,668

China is now the world’s second-largest drugs market behind the United States and is a particular bright spot for AstraZeneca, accounting for 15 percent of its drug sales — a far higher proportion than at other big pharmaceutical companies. AstraZeneca’s sales in China grew 30 percent in the last quarter of 2017 and Chief Executive Pascal Soriot expects them to continue to increase at a “low-20s” percentage rate. The new strategic partnership with Ali Health, a subsidiary company of Alibaba, aims to deliver new smart health services driven by the Internet and artificial intelligence to help patients find and stay on the right medicines. The deal with Tencent, meanwhile, involves the development of online tracking systems to fight counterfeit medicines — a common problem in China. Both deals were announced on Friday, alongside AstraZeneca’s full-year results. [nL8N1PS1G6] “Overall, these agreements will drive better health outcomes and ... better utilization of our drugs,” said Chief Executive Pascal Soriot. The tech tie-ups come two months after AstraZeneca created a new drug development joint venture with a state-backed private equity fund in China, designed to help get new drugs to market more quickly.

Coherus’ shares fell nearly 25 percent to $15.50 in trading before the bell. The biosimilar, CHS-1701, is among Redwood City, California-based Coherus’ lead experimental drugs. The FDA’s response comes as Amgen gears up for biosimilar competition for Neulasta, which generated about $4.6 billion in sales last year. Biosimilars aim to copy biologic products, which are made inside living cells, but they can never be exact duplicates, so biosimilar manufacturers need to conduct clinical trials to show their products work as intended. The FDA requested Coherus for a re-analysis of certain data and asked the drug developer for more manufacturing information, Coherus said, adding that it would work with the agency to address the concerns. Amgen’s shares were up about 1 percent at $165.75 in premarket trading.

2018-05-17 00:00:00,2018,5.0,17,'Outrageous' drug prices are a fair trade issue: Mt. Sinai CEO Davis,"The Trump administration should address the high cost of prescription drugs in trade negotiations, Mt. Sinai CEO Kenneth Davis told CNBC on Thursday. ""Americans wind up paying much more for our drugs than anywhere else in the world. The rest of the world controls their prices; the U.S., it's a free market,"" he said on ""Closing Bell. "" ""Essentially the U.S. is underwriting the research and development costs that happen for the rest of the world. This is a trade issue. This is a fair trade issue, and we have to bring it up in trade negotiations,"" he added. His argument echoes that of President Donald Trump. Last week, Trump accused foreign allies of paying less than the United States for prescription drugs while benefiting from American investment in research and drug development. He said he has directed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to make fixing this a top priority with every trading partner. The idea behind the Trump plan is drug companies should raise prices overseas where governments subsidize costs and lower prices in the U.S. Davis said there is one big concern, however. ""If we can convince the rest of the world to raise their prices, will the drug companies pass that on so that there are savings to the American consumer?"" he said. The solution may be legislation that would make sure that drug companies used the advantage they gained through the trade negotiations to help patients, he added. ""The prices now are too outrageous,"" Davis said. ""We have to make this more equitable across the world, and we have to find ways to do that."" — CNBC's Berkeley Lovelace contributed to this report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/17/outrageous-drug-prices-are-a-fair-trade-issue-mt-sinai-ceo-davis.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,277
2019-12-05 14:29:46,2019,12.0,5,7 Heroin Users Die From Flesh-Eating Bacteria in San Diego,"County health officials are asking the medical community to be on the lookout for additional cases of myonecrosis, a bacterial infection associated with black-tar heroin use. Seven people in San Diego have died in the last two months from a flesh-eating bacteria associated with black-tar heroin use, prompting public health officials to warn the medical community to be on the lookout for additional cases. The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency reported Wednesday that the seven people died from myonecrosis, a severe infection that destroys muscle tissue. The dead ranged in age from 19 to 57; five were male. They were among nine people admitted between Oct. 2 and Nov. 24 to county hospitals with the condition after injecting black-tar heroin, a dark, sticky drug that often contains impurities resulting from crude processing methods. Two remain hospitalized. One is expected to survive; the other is “quite ill,” said Dr. Eric McDonald, medical director for the epidemiology program at the county health agency. Dr. McDonald said the outbreak of myonecrosis was the most serious the county has seen in 10 years, although there have been similar outbreaks in California in the late 1990s and early 2000s. “You just have to recognize it really early and have early surgery, and give antibiotics really quickly, and hope that not enough toxin has been produced to cause death,” Dr. McDonald said in an interview. The source of the heroin is unknown and an investigation is continuing, the county said. Most black-tar heroin is produced in Mexico and sold in the United States west of the Mississippi River, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Dr. Wilma Wooten, a county public health official, said people who use black-tar heroin are not only at higher risk of dying from an overdose, but also more prone to developing myonecrosis and wound botulism, a rare but serious illness that attacks the body’s nerves. The county asked the medical community to be on alert for additional cases of both conditions. Symptoms of myonecrosis include severe pain and swelling around a wound or injection site; pale skin that quickly turns gray, dark red, purple or black; blisters with a foul-smelling discharge; air under the skin; and fever. Signs of wound botulism include drooping eyelids, blurred vision, slurred speech, trouble swallowing and difficulty breathing. The condition can cause paralysis that begins at the face and head and travels down the body. The county warned that “cooking” black-tar heroin does not kill the bacteria that causes wound botulism. In October, the county confirmed its first case of wound botulism from black-tar heroin use this year. Seven cases were reported last year and three in 2017. Across Southern California, 13 probable and confirmed wound botulism cases, mostly among black-tar heroin users, have been reported since Sept. 1, the county said. Dr. Paul Little, medical director at the Laguna Treatment Hospital, an addiction treatment center in Aliso Viejo, Calif., said he hoped the seven deaths would prompt black-tar heroin users to seek treatment. “If you ever see a wound like this, it’s pretty devastating,” he said. “It’s just another situation where it shows the dangerous epidemic of the opioids we’re facing now.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/health/flesh-eating-bacteria-san-diego.html,health,The New York Times,health,531

Page's absence was widely noted last week when a seat set for a Google executive at a congressional hearing remained empty, while Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey addressed lawmakers about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. But Page's withdrawal was felt among employees and Google's sister companies much earlier, the report says.

2019-08-19 00:00:00,2019,8.0,19,Visa critical of India's move toward no-fee debit card transactions,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Global card payments group Visa is critical of the Indian government’s decision to boost adoption of electronic payments by requiring banks and card payment networks to offer no-fee debit card transactions, a senior Visa executive said. Last month, India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that businesses with annual turnover of 500 million rupees will not have to pay a merchant discount rate on debit card and other digital modes of transactions, excluding credit cards. The discount rate is paid by the merchant to banks, card payment networks, and other financial intermediaries for handling a digital transaction. For debit cards, the fees are on average between 0.40% and 0.80% of the transaction amount, according to industry officials. “I find the logic a bit fallacious because the cost is not free ... I am a firm believer in low economics, but no economics student can believe in no economics,” T.R. Ramachandran, Visa’s India and South Asia head, said on Monday, speaking on a panel at an industry conference. Ramachandran said if the government, the merchant and the consumer are all saving on the cost of cash via an electronic payments mechanism then the stakeholders should be adequately compensated. India’s Finance Ministry was not immediately reachable for comment on the matter outside of business hours. Sitharaman had said in her budget speech that the Reserve Bank of India and banks would absorb these costs from the savings that will accrue to them on account of handling less cash as people move to digital payments. But industry officials say there is still no clarity on who will pick up the tab. The no-fee debit card plan could hit the fee revenues of banks, which are already burdened with bad loans of about $150 billion. As of May this year there were 824.9 million debit cards in circulation in India compared with 48.9 million credit cards, according to the Reserve Bank of India.

2019-09-25 00:00:00,2019,9.0,25,This shapeshifting robot could explore other planets," (CNN)Robots are the intrepid explorers of our solar system, boldly venturing where humans can't to capture images and scientific data about other planets and moons. Because we're still learning about these other bodies, robotic explorers may need to be more adaptable to strange and inhospitable environments. Enter the Shapeshifter, a Transformer-esque collection of mini robots that can form one machine or act independently. A team is currently testing the concept using a 3D-printed prototype at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, according to NASA. The concept could include 12 robots that can fly or swim, exploring caves and oceans and going where other robots haven't been able to explore. They're called cobots, each equipped with a propeller. The researchers envision cobots that could come together automatically, without anyone from Earth sending commands, to form into a rolling sphere, fly independently or even create a daisy chain while exploring a cave. The current prototype looks more like a semi-autonomous hamster wheel with a drone at the center. It can split and form two flying drones. It's being tested as part of NASA's Innovative Advanced Concepts research program. The program funds concepts that sound impossible but could help make scientific discoveries in the future.  Ali Agha, a principal investigator at JPL, could see Shapeshifter exploring Titan, Saturn's moon with bodies of liquid methane on the surface. A drone lander called Dragonfly will set off for Titan in 2026 to follow up on observations made by NASA's Cassini mission that previously explored Saturn and Titan. Cassini was able to perform only flybys of Titan.  Shapeshifter could actually explore the moon itself, including possible ice volcanoes or caves hiding beneath its dense atmosphere.  ""We have very limited information about the composition of the surface. Rocky terrain, methane lakes, cryovolcanoes - we potentially have all of these, but we don't know for certain,"" said Agha. ""So we thought about how to create a system that is versatile and capable of traversing different types of terrain but also compact enough to launch on a rocket."" In concept, the cobots could rely on a spacecraft lander that can deliver them to Titan, provide energy and carry instruments for experiments and analysis. They would want the lander to be portable. If it were similar in size to the European Space Agency's Huygens Probe, which traveled with Cassini and explored Titan, Agha estimates that 10 cobots could lift and carry the lander. The Huygens Probe was 9 feet wide.  ""It is often the case that some of the hardest places to get to are the most scientifically interesting because maybe they're the youngest, or they're in an area that was not well characterized from orbit,"" said Jason Hofgartner, JPL lead scientist for Shapeshifter. ""Shapeshifter's remarkable versatility enables access to all of these scientifically compelling places."" The concept will be submitted in 2020 for the Phase II's selection process, with the team's hopes of one day exploring Titan.

2018-08-07 00:00:00,2018,8.0,7,Snapchat’s redesign cost it millions of users,"Snap CEO Evan Spiegel hoped that a Snapchat redesign would invigorate the platform’s advertisers and better cater ads to users. But in the months following its unveiling, 1.2 million users around the world signed a petition begging the company to reconsider. Snap followed through with its plans, and today, Snap confirmed that the redesign cost it to lose 2 percent of its daily active users — from 191 million to 188 million — in just a quarter. Spiegel said during today’s prepared earnings call remarks that it took users’ feedback seriously. “We feel that we have now addressed the biggest frustrations we’ve heard and are eager to make more progress on the tremendous opportunity we now have to show more of the right content to the right people.” Still, this marks the first time the company’s lost users since going public, and it won’t be easy to gain them back. The rest of the company’s financials exceeded investors’ expectations. Revenue increased 44 percent year-over-year, from $182 million in the second quarter of last year to $262 million this year. Its stock is up, possibly because in addition to increasing revenue, Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal acquired a 2.3 percent stake in the company. Notably, the company relaunched its Spectacles glasses this past quarter, but didn’t offer much information on how they’re selling. Spiegel mentioned them only briefly, saying that the company is “learning a lot” from customer feedback, and that he envisions them being essential to Snap’s future plans around augmented reality. Overall, it’s not great news for investors that Snapchat lost users, especially considering how heavily Instagram is now gunning for it. Even Kylie Jenner, who once loved Snapchat, launched her own makeup filter on Instagram last month without building one for Snapchat. That loss might matter more than some angry users.

2020-03-19 00:00:00,2020,3.0,19,Soccer-Fury grows as Turkish leagues continue despite widening outbreak,"ANKARA, March 19 (Reuters) - Turkey’s sports minister is meeting on Thursday with soccer, basketball and volleyball federations to discuss a widening coronavirus outbreak after players and coaches criticised the decision to continue playing matches. Turkey has confirmed 191 cases and two deaths from the virus. It has taken several steps to contain the spread including travel restrictions, ordering sports events to be played without spectators and banning mass prayers until further notice. On Wednesday the government ramped up measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, but President Tayyip Erdogan stopped short of pausing sports leagues as some expected. The overwhelming majority of European soccer leagues, and several others globally, have shut down. Earlier this week, Turkey’s Football Federation chairman Nihat Ozdemir said: “We will continue to play all games without fans until the end of April.” He is among those meeting the sports minister on Thursday. On Thursday, soccer’s global players union FIFPRO said it had written to the Turkish league asking it to “urgently reconsider” its decision to continue matches and training. “Numerous foreign players have contacted us to say they are uncomfortable continuing as #COVID19 spreads,” FIFPRO said on Twitter. Galatasaray’s Colombian striker Radamel Falcao joined the chorus of footballers criticising the decision to continue playing. “People are dying around the world and we are talking to play football,” he said on Twitter. Kayserispor’s Bernard Mensah also took to social media to express his frustration. “Life is the most important thing on earth ... this is (a) serious thing happening and they still insist to continue do they really care about us?” the 25-year old Ghanaian posted on Twitter. Galatasaray’s basketball players issued a joint statement saying they found it “quite bizarre” that they continued playing. John Obi Mikel left Turkish side Trabzonspor days after the former Chelsea midfielder said he did not feel comfortable with top-flight games in the country being played. The chairman of league leaders Trabzonspor, however, said any delay to Super League matches would lead to an increase in the number of divorces. “Football is the one thing in Turkey that allows people to get rid of their stress, to entertain themselves and to occupy their minds,” chairman Ahmet Agaoglu said, wearing a protective mask as he spoke to the media. “If they suspend the league for a long time, in a month from now there won’t be enough judges to rule on all the divorce cases,” he added. “We are the leaders right now. Trabzonspor should be declared champions.” (Writing by Ece Toksabay Editing by Toby Davis)",https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-turkey-soccer/soccer-fury-grows-as-turkish-leagues-continue-despite-widening-outbreak-idUSL8N2BC2W8,Healthcare,Reuters,health,426

2016-07-14 00:00:00,2016,7.0,14,Zika: CDC wants to collect semen from men who had Zika," (CNN)The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is collecting semen from hundreds of men in the United States in order to figure out how long the dreaded Zika virus lasts in the bodily fluid.  The virus can be transmitted sexually, and it's been known to linger in semen long after a man's fever, rash and itchy eyes have gone away.  If a man has the virus in his semen and has sex with a woman who is pregnant or becomes pregnant, the baby could be born with devastating neurological birth defects.  After about two months of recruiting, some 40 men who've had Zika have volunteered to donate their semen. The CDC hopes to bring in about 210 more.  The men are asked to make about a dozen donations in their homes every other week for six months after their illness, and each time are given a $50 multi-use gift card. A courier picks up the donations, which are then delivered to the CDC's labs in Fort Collins, Colorado.  ""I'm happy to say patients really have been quite receptive about volunteering their specimens,"" said Dr. Paul Mead, the senior epidemiologist at the CDC who is running the study. ""They seem to understand the importance of the study.""  So far, there have been more than a thousand cases of Zika in the United States, and that number is expected to grow.  There have been 14 cases of sexual transmission of the virus, according to the CDC, although some experts think the actual number is higher.  The CDC currently recommends that men who've had Zika use a condom or abstain from sex for six months after their illness.   That advice is based on studying the semen of just three men who had Zika, which is why the CDC is doing the larger study.  Separately, the CDC is doing a study in Puerto Rico that will examine the semen of men who contracted Zika but never actually had symptoms of the disease -- an important group since many who become infected have only mild symptoms or none at all, according to the CDC.  In addition to looking at the virus in semen, the Puerto Rico study  will also be examining blood, saliva and vaginal secretions.  The CDC plans to recruit 300 men and women in Puerto Rico who've had Zika and 1,000 people who live in the same households. ""The response has been amazing. People have welcomed strangers to come and get their bodily fluids,"" said Dr. Gabriela Paz-Bailey, the investigation's lead researcher.  She said the Puerto Rico study is the largest collection ever of bodily fluids from Zika patients.  ""Nearly everyone we've approached has agreed to participate,"" Paz-Bailey said. ""They understand that many things are not yet known.""  ",https://www.cnn.com/2016/07/14/health/zika-semen-cdc/index.html,health,CNN,health,455
2016-03-04 00:00:00,2016,3.0,4,Heat is on Telecom Italia's CEO as Vivendi pushes on strategy,"MILAN (Reuters) - A jump in the company’s share price should brighten the mood of any chief executive but that is unlikely to have been the effect this week on Marco Patuano, the head of Telecom Italia. After he strategy meeting in Paris with executives from his new top shareholder Vivendi on Wednesday, market speculation mounted that the French group led by business tycoon Vincent Bollore might force change with or without Patuano, sending Telecom Italia’s shares up by over 6 percent. Investors bet the evidence of increased pressure from Vivendi could open the way to a radical overhaul of the heavily-indebted group. “Patuano is a bit of a man of the past and I’m not sure how long he can stay in the saddle, unless he aligns himself with Vivendi,” said Tommaso Iaquinta of boutique investment bank Livolsi-Iaquinta & Partners. Since taking over as CEO in late 2013, Patuano has had to steer a course for one of Italy’s most politically sensitive companies which will not upset the sometimes conflicting interests of the state, employees and shareholders. Patuano, who started his career in Telecom Italia in 1990 straight after university and worked his way up through the ranks to become chief operating officer before taking over as CEO, has stepped up spending on faster fixed and mobile networks as the government seeks to get internet connections across the nation up to speed with the rest of Europe. He has also struck deals with content providers such as Sky Italia, Netflix and Mediaset in a search for new sources of income and to better compete with rivals. Unlike his predecessor Franco Bernabe, who opposed asset sales and pushed for a share issue before quitting in a clash over strategy with core investors, Patuano began to sell non-core assets to continue cutting Telecom Italia’s debt of around 27 billion euros ($29.6 billion). He struck the deal to sell its controlling stake in Telecom Argentina, which after much delay a regulatory source said was finally approved on Thursday, and spun off radio masts unit INWIT. However, Patuano’s relations with Vivendi were tense from the start, a source close to the matter said. The French group took 8 percent of Telecom Italia in June as part payment for selling Brazilian broadband firm GVT to Spain’s Telefonica, which at the time was Telecom Italia’s biggest shareholder. Vivendi has since steadily built up its stake, tightening its grip on the company, and leaving Patuano under pressure to cut costs at home and decide what to do with its Brazilian business, TIM Participacoes, where Patuano was once chief financial officer. What to do is a bone of contention. “Vivendi wants to sell Brazil, and Patuano does not,” the source said. Patuano has said he sees TIM Participacoes, Brazil’s second-biggest mobile network operator behind Telefonica Brasil, as strategic. And last month Telecom Italia walked away from a proposal to merge TIM with rival Oi because, according to a source close to the matter, it would not have had control of the combined entity. Meanwhile the sudden emergence last October of French telecoms tycoon Xavier Niel as potentially Telecom Italia’s second-largest shareholder - he has bought options relating to a 15.1 percent stake - is further complicating matters. Vivendi and Niel have repeatedly said they are not acting in concert, but their exact long-term aims for investing in Telecom Italia remain unclear. However, Vivendi described Telecom Italia as “a rudderless ship” in December before going on to secure four board seats. It has since turned up the heat further by raising its stake in the Italian group to 23.8 percent. However, another source close to the matter said Vivendi might be pushing for change but is not in a position to act alone, given it only has four of 17 board members. “Telecom Italia is strategic for the whole Italian industry, the financial sector and the political powers. Nothing can happen without the involvement of these big powers,” the source said. Telecom Italia has seen revenues decline steadily amid tough competition in its mature home market, which is just emerging from a protracted recession, and is now grappling with an economic downturn and currency devaluation in Brazil. Analysts say Vivendi’s interest might lead to a tie-up between Telecom Italia and another telecoms or media operator. So far the French group has only said that it wants to use Telecom Italia to develop its existing businesses in southern Europe and boost its content offering. “Vivendi’s investment in Telecom Italia is the launchpad for something bigger to come, like an M&A deal, as the telecoms industry in Europe is expected to consolidate,” said Enrico Vaccari, fund manager at Italy’s Consultinvest.

The drug was approved for use as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with a common chemotherapy regimen, to treat previously untreated patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, Merck said.  The approval is based on results from a late-stage trial, where Keytruda showed a significant improvement in overall survival in cancer patients, Merck said.    Keytruda, a type of immunotherapy called a PD-1 inhibitor, is already an approved treatment for several forms of cancer, including lung and skin cancers.  Head and neck cancer includes tumors in the mouth, tongue, nose, sinuses, throat and lymph nodes in the neck.  Merck estimates that there will be more than 65,000 new cases of head and neck cancer diagnosed in 2019 in the United States.   Keytruda works by increasing the ability of patients’ immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells.  The drug has been amassing approvals as a standalone therapy and in combination with other drugs to treat several forms of cancer. It is the leading immunotherapy for treating lung cancer, ahead of rival drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche and AstraZeneca.    Keytruda, first approved for advanced melanoma in 2014, is Merck’s most important growth driver. It has overtaken Bristol’s Opdivo as the industry’s immuno-oncology leader with sales expected to top $10 billion this year and $20 billion in 2024, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Keytruda brought in revenue of $7.17 billion for Merck in 2018, while Bristol’s Opdivo earned $6.74 billion.

2020-03-26 00:00:00,2020,3.0,26,Boxing-Task Force questions link between London qualifier and virus tests,"LONDON, March 26 (Reuters) - Organisers of a suspended Olympic boxing qualifying tournament in London hit back at accusations of irresponsibility on Thursday after two Turkish competitors and a coach tested positive for coronavirus on returning home. The event at the Copper Box arena, featuring men and women from 43 countries seeking places at the now-postponed Tokyo 2020 Games, was halted on March 16 after three days. The International Olympic Committee’s Boxing Task Force (BTF), who organised the event after last year’s suspension of world boxing body AIBA, wished those concerned a speedy recovery. “Some news reports appeared to draw a connection between the affected participants and the Boxing Road to Tokyo European qualifier held in London,” it said in a statement. “The London event was suspended 10 days ago... and the BTF is not aware of any link between the competition and the infection. “Many participants were in independently organised training camps in Italy, Great Britain and in their home countries before the competition started on 14 March 2020 and have returned home a while ago so it is not possible to know the source of infection.” The Turkish Boxing Federation named one of its boxers as middleweight Serhat Guler, who had a bye before beating Israeli Mikhail Ostroumov on March 16. Federation president Eyup Gozgec said on Wednesday the situation was “the disastrous result of the irresponsibility of the IOC task force”. “This virus has been around since December 2019. Therefore, it is inevitable to ask why the European Qualification event was not postponed before it even took place,” he wrote in a letter to board members of the European Boxing Confederation. The BTF said many other sports and public events were going on in Britain at the time because the government had not imposed restrictions. It said precautionary measures were taken before, during and after the event, with the well-being of athletes the top priority. A spokesman for local organisers said the medical team had been in daily contact with Public Health England throughout the tournament with regular guidance provided to all teams. Hand sanitizers had been provided throughout the competition spaces, with spectators barred on the final Monday and daily temperature tests for competitors. “Teams were advised on the steps they should take if any members of their delegation showed symptoms of the virus,” he added. “During the competition there were no recorded instances of teams contacting the medical team to report symptoms.” Gozgec’s criticism of the ‘horrible event’ followed remarks from Umar Kremlev, president of Russia’s Boxing Federation, who had said it was ‘ridiculous’ the tournament had ever started. Kremlev is a senior official of the International Boxing Association, and chairman of its market commission, while Gozgec also sits on AIBA’s 28 member executive committee. The IOC suspended AIBA over issues surrounding its finances and governance.

Part of the problem is that many developers simply aren't thinking about potential harassment from the start. With many games being made by small teams rather than huge studios, the impetus to tackle social interactions when there are bigger technical concerns simply isn't there. It is also potentially not something they themselves have experienced online. Game development is a bit more diverse than other tech industries, but only 22 percent of roles are held by women, many of whom leave the industry mid-career. One of the major concerns with VR is that it brings all of the harassment we see online to a more intimate, virtual environment, where it can feel like other users can invade your personal space. I spoke with Suzanne Leibrick, a VRDC speaker and user experience designer who has experienced VR harassment. ""It's very easy to see other people as not real, as just another video game character, rather than seeing them as a real person,"" she said. ""It becomes much easier to say 'Sure, I can grope this, I can do whatever I want, this isn't a real person,' which is problematic. So we do need to give users tools, like ways to block or mute, or never hear from certain people again that aren't intrusive"". There is also a lack of uniformity in how users go about blocking or muting people they don't want to interact with. There is also a real need to enable users to prioritize their own audio, and to disable other users from talking over you excessively. Some tools appear relatively straightforward, but in action are too time consuming when, as Suzanne described ""that person is teleporting around you as fast as they can move while they're harassing you verbally. Simple design choices like that have unintended consequences, they make it harder on the user."" Jonathan Schenker, one of the developers of QuiVr, an archery castle defence game for the HTC Vive, said his small team was quick to react to the virtual groping that occurred within their game. It created a 'power gesture' that blocked the harasser by dissolving them from your view. When I asked him about user testing, he told me ""I have no QA team, the public is my QA team. When events like this happen, I understand the necessity and the want for people to hold the developer accountable, but at the same time, the game being played is a technical alpha, and the entire function of it is to get feedback to learn what is and isn't working"". That seems to be the crux of many harassment concerns in VR—that developers need to know when social problems arise so they can create tools, which sets a tone that harassment will not be tolerated. The more people talk about their experiences, the more user safety settings will be introduced to combat harassment and bad behavior. As speaker Banun Idris added ""What we've learned from MMOs and the internet en masse, is it doesn't really matter unless we can hold users accountable for their actions. The way I think about it is: as developers and designers, we have the responsibility to do all that we can to discourage and not to reward unethical behavior. VR has a lot potential, and to extend far beyond the gaming space, which is why developers have to take the issue of harassment so seriously. For Jonathan Schenken, the need to provide users with tools is clear cut: ""Any time that someone gets turned away from VR is a tragedy, because it's just so freaking cool"".

2019-10-30 11:36:00,2019,10.0,30,Chelsea Clinton Comments on JAY-Z's Response to Beyoncé's Weight,"Chelsea Clinton isn’t a fan of the way JAY-Z reacted to Beyoncé when she shared her excitement about fitting into her old costumes following the birth of the couple’s twins, Rumi and Sir — documented in her hit Coachella concert film, Homecoming.  In a profile for The Cut, Clinton recalled the moment she and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, watched Beyoncé’s Netflix documentary and she was taken aback at the rapper’s response — or lack thereof — to his wife’s weight loss announcement. The 39-year-old author explained that in the scene, the Lemonade artist FaceTimes her husband to show off her post-baby body in her pre-pregnancy costumes to which JAY-Z doesn’t appear to be very enthused. “And I said, ‘Marc, if that’s ever me, you better have more enthusiasm,’” Clinton said she told her husband while watching the film at the time. “It wasn’t the ‘I’m so proud of you. That’s amazing’ that I arguably think any woman deserves, particularly someone who has clearly worked herself body, mind, heart, soul, and spirit to get to that place,” Clinton continued, sharing how she believed JAY-Z should have reacted to his wife’s achievement. “Marc was like, ‘Duly noted.’ And I was like, ‘I bet every woman watching this has this sense of ‘She deserves more enthusiasm,&apos” she explained, before noting that her husband was ready to move on from the discussion to continue watching the film. “Marc was like, ‘I got it. Can we go back to watching it, please? We’ve talked about it three times in the last 90 seconds,” she added. Despite disagreeing with the way the “Empire State of Mind” rapper responded to his wife, Clinton “loved Homecoming” regardless, she told the outlet. Recently, Clinton and Mevinsky welcomed their own baby, Jasper Clinton Mezvinsky. “This morning we welcomed our son, Jasper Clinton Mezvinsky,” she tweeted on July 22. “We are overflowing with love and gratitude and can’t wait to introduce him to his big sister and brother.” The pair are also parents to Aidan, 3, and Charlotte, 5. Clinton’s mother, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, re-shared the exciting news, adding, “Sharing some happy news this morning! Bill and I are so thrilled.”",https://people.com/health/chelsea-clinton-jay-z-different-response-to-beyonces-post-pregnancy-weight-loss/,health,People,health,363
2018-11-06 00:00:00,2018,11.0,6,Apple MacBook Air review,"For years, people have been practically begging Apple to update the beloved MacBook Air with a better screen. Instead, Apple left it to collect dust on the shelf, adding only new processors over the years. Now it's been completely designed, and millions of MacBook Air fans are going to love it. This is important in light of Apple's Mac business, which has been pretty flat. Apple sold 5.3 million Macs during the fourth quarter of 2018, a hair below the 5.39 million it sold in the year-ago quarter. Colleagues and friends of mine have hung on to their older MacBook Airs, waiting for Apple to launch a new model. It hits stores on Wednesday, and I think it's going to help boost those flattened Mac sales. I've been testing the new MacBook Air for several days. Here's what you need to know. The new Air finally has a much sharper Retina display, which has been available on MacBook Pro since 2012 and the MacBook since 2015. This is the display Air fans have been clamoring for. Text is sharp when I'm reading the news, movies look great, and it gets nice and bright. It's also plenty large, at 13.3-inches, which means you have more space for doing stuff without squinting and more room for moving windows around, as opposed to the smaller, but more expensive and less powerful, regular MacBook. The second I opened the MacBook Air box in the office, my colleagues gathered around and attempted to slide it into purses and backpacks. They were giddy that it's lighter than our work-issued laptops and older MacBooks. I love the brushed aluminum metal body, which makes it feel more premium and more rock-solid than other laptops on the market. There's barely any flexing or bending. The speakers get nice and loud — my wife asked me to turn down a movie while she was working at a nearby table — and have great surround-sound audio. The larger track pad gives you more room for zooming into photos with two fingers, or gesturing to view all of your open windows with three fingers. It's been updated to Apple's newer technology, which allows you to tap down anywhere, instead of only at the front of the touchpad like on older MacBook Airs. And it's speedy. I tested a unit with Intel's Core i5 processor, which is sold in the entry-level model. I once bought and returned the smaller MacBook, because it comes with a less powerful processor that became sluggish when I had too many browser tabs and apps open. The MacBook Air doesn't have that issue. However, if you want to do professional video editing, you may want to consider Apple's MacBook Pros, which have more muscle under the hood. There are two Thunderbolt 3 ports on the side, which is plenty, and they work overtime to support all sorts of things, from a 5K display to fast external storage and even the MacBook's charger. If you're using it for work, you might want to consider a dock that has a few more ports for older USB keys or a keyboard and mouse, without the need for adapters. Here's the thing though: Aside from perhaps wanting to connect a display, I really never found a need to connect anything else. I don't really use USB keys anymore, and everything else I need, like pictures I take on my phone, are all in the cloud. There's a tiny square Touch ID sensor that let me unlock the MacBook with a tap of my finger. I appreciate the speed, but I wish Apple included its Face ID technology above the screen instead. I'm used to it on my iPhone XS Max, and there seems to be plenty of room above the display to fit the cameras required. Touch ID feels outdated, since Apple has already moved away from it on its iPads and iPhones. Even with the power boost, the battery life still rocks. I spent most some of my weekend trying to vet Apple's promise of 13 hours of video playback. I did this by streaming movies from iTunes over and over with the brightness set at medium. The MacBook Air finally died after 11 hours and 3 minutes. That's short of the 13 hours of video playback Apple promises, but I wasn't just watching the movies, I was streaming them, which also drains battery life. It's still incredibly impressive. I really wish Apple kept the original keyboard from the MacBook Air. A lot of people seriously loved the chiclet design and deep key travel — the nice punch you get when you tap a key on the keyboard. That keyboard was so good it was mimicked by pretty much every computer maker. The new design is OK, and I adjusted to typing quickly and accurately on it, but it's definitely hard to get used to the small amount of key travel. It kind of feels like you're barely tapping a key before it registers, as if it's just a bit too sensitive. This isn't reason enough to skip buying the MacBook Air altogether, but it's just not as good as the keyboard on the older MacBooks. I prefer the keyboard on Microsoft's Surface Laptop 2, which is more like the original MacBook Air design. Also, it's more expensive than the original MacBook Air (which Apple still sells for $899.) This might turn some people off, particularly those with a $1,000 budget for a new laptop. I think Apple would have trouble keeping these in stock if it charged less than $1,000, but it certainly feels worth the price. Finally, and maybe this is nitpicking, I did have a few instances where I tried to touch the screen. I normally use a Windows laptop with a touchscreen, so I've become adjusted to quickly tapping to exit out of a window, or skipping a song on Spotify, without using the mouse. You can't do that on the MacBook Air, and Apple explained that macOS isn't an interface that's designed for touch. That's fair, but I think people are so used to touching tablets and phones that there's a natural desire to tap a computer screen, too.. Microsoft Windows 10 proves it's possible to do without being confusing, all in a similar environment. Yes. This is the MacBook to buy, and I think it has serious potential to help Apple boost Mac sales again. People like me have been turned off by the lower-powered, small and more expensive MacBook. And I don't need the power or want to pay the higher price of the MacBook Pro. This sits right in the middle and gives consumers almost everything they loved about earlier MacBook Airs, but with a beautiful new display and improved performance. If you prefer Windows PCs, however, I highly recommend Microsoft's Surface Laptop 2. It offers a similar thin-and-light experience, a great design, good battery life and a touchscreen display. You can't go wrong with either one, but Apple fans finally have the MacBook Air they've been waiting for.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/05/apple-macbook-air-review.html,Tech Guide,CNBC,technology,1176
2016-02-27 00:00:00,2016,2.0,27,"HP taps Mizrahi for fashionable watches, but will women bite?","Smartwatchers are evolving beyond tech gadgets and into fashion statements. In late January, software giant Hewlett-Packard teamed up with fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi to launch the latest entrant into the increasingly crowded wearables market. The HP-Mizrahi watch, however, aims to distinguish itself from its competitors: Unlike Apple or Pebble, the HP-engineered Mizrahi smartwatch places more of an emphasis on fashion rather than technology. Although the Mizrahi watch's $249 price tag makes it cheaper than an AppleWatch, evidence suggests women aren't as enamored of wearables as men are. In a recent interview, Mizrahi explained why that wasn't necessarily a concern. Read MoreFitbit shares plunge 15% on guidance ""Smartwatches are meant to be unisex but there's nothing feminine about them,"" Mizrahi told CNBC. ""This smartwatch is different from others out there because it looks like a very chic, classic watch. Women will love it."" Armed with a five-day battery life, the watch has the ability to receive electronic notifications such as texts, calls, and calendar alerts, and is paired with a mobile app. Mizrahi's smartwatch comes in either a gold or silver watch face framed by Swarovski crystals, and an option to interchange multi-colored strap bands—all part of the designer's strategy to emphasize fashion over function. ""In all of the smartwatches I've seen, there have been fashionable components,"" he said. ""However, I think each time they've missed the woman who should wear my smartwatch. It's for the fashionable woman on the go who wants to be updated about everything she wants to know."" The Mizrahi line comes at an auspicious juncture for the wearables market, which is expected to ship 245 million devices by 2019 and grow into a $25 billion market, according to CCS Insight. The smartwatch market, however, is suffering from a gender gap of sorts. Data from market research firm NPD Group shows that a whopping 71 percent of smartwatch owners are male, but most fitness trackers are worn by women. All of which suggests women may prefer the modesty and functionality of fitness trackers like Fitbit, some observers say, while avoiding the fashion bells and whistles of designer smartwatches. ""The exterior design is only half the hill to climb,"" said Nicola Fumo, style editor at Racked.com. ""Most smartwatch makers seem to think if they do a rose-gold version and add crystals to the bezel, it'll magically appeal to women,"" said Fumo. ""It's a pretty offensive trope that leans on dated ideas of women loving just shiny things."" The tepid reception to the Apple Watch since its introduction last year speaks to what some consider the smartwatch's biggest handicap: Its inability to stand alone as a self-sufficient device. ""The biggest issue facing the smartwatch today is that the vast majority of the devices are still a slave to the user's smartphone,"" said Wes Henderek, director of Collected Intelligence's wearables practice. Pointing out that most users still carry their mobile devices with them, Henderek added that ""what the smartwatch needs to become a more mainstream product is the ability to function independently."" That may be one reason why some companies steer clear of the smartwatch label altogether. Fitbit, currently the wearables industry leader, has studiously branded its device as a ""fitness watch."" Regardless, technology research firm Gartner holds a bright outlook for the smartwatch. Gartner estimates a steady increase in sales and popularity for the device, and expects the 30 million units sold in 2015 to nearly double over the next two years. The trick to boosting the smartwatch's appeal among women will be the acid test for devices that push style over substance, which could turn out to be a losing proposition. ""Once the independent connectivity issues and the development of a more robust application ecosystem are addressed, then the smartwatch market will be in a better position,"" Henderek said. ""These devices still have a ways to go in terms of appealing to the fashion-centric segment.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/26/hp-taps-mizrahi-for-fashionable-watches-but-will-women-bite.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,647
2020-03-05 00:00:00,2020,3.0,5,Sonos getting rid of Recycle Mode that needlessly bricked its older devices,"Sonos is doing away with Recycle Mode, a controversial part of the company’s trade-up program that rendered old devices inoperable in exchange for a 30 percent discount on a newer Sonos product. The trade-up program still exists, and customers who own eligible legacy products can get the same discount, but they’re no longer required to permanently brick devices that might still work just fine. With the change, Sonos is now giving customers full control over what happens with the older gadgets they’re “trading” up from. They can choose to keep it, give it to someone, recycle it at a local e-waste facility, or send it to Sonos and let the company handle the responsible recycling part. Sonos quietly removed Recycle Mode from its app last week and replaced it with language asking anyone seeking the discount to call customer service. Within the next few weeks, Sonos will update its website with a new flow for the trade-up program that no longer includes Recycle Mode, and you won’t have to call anybody. This decision should bring an end to criticism that Sonos faced late last year when Devin Wilson brought attention to Recycle Mode and raised questions around the company’s sustainability practices. At the time, Sonos said it wasn’t forcing anyone to participate in the trade-up program, and customers who wanted to use legacy devices could continue doing so. But it kept Recycle Mode in place for those who did want the 30 percent deal. When triggered, Recycle Mode would start an irreversible 21-day countdown, after which the device in question would cease functioning. Sonos said it went this route to ensure that consumer data was being erased on recycled products. Now, Sonos will instead encourage customers to perform a factory reset before bringing their old gear to an e-waste recycler. Which Sonos products are considered “legacy” and part of the trade-up program? Legacy products that are eligible for the Sonos trade-up include the original Sonos Play:5, Zone Players, and Connect / Connect:Amp devices manufactured between 2011 and 2015. All other products are considered modern and will continue to get software updates after May. Today’s news doesn’t change Sonos’ plans to stop releasing new software updates for legacy devices sometime in May. The company botched its messaging around that so badly that CEO Patrick Spence posted an apology and said “all Sonos products will continue to work past May.” “While legacy Sonos products won’t get new software features, we pledge to keep them updated with bug fixes and security patches for as long as possible,” Spence wrote in January. “If we run into something core to the experience that can’t be addressed, we’ll work to offer an alternative solution and let you know about any changes you’ll see in your experience. But they won’t be gaining any new features, and customers who want to keep using old products will have to fork them off from their primary Sonos system — otherwise, all products will stop getting software updates when the cutoff happens. “We are working on a way to split your system so that modern products work together and get the latest features, while legacy products work together and remain in their current state.” A Sonos spokesperson reiterated that this is the plan and said the company will have more to share over the next few weeks.",https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166777/sonos-ending-recycle-mode-trade-up-program-sustainability,Tech,The Verge,technology,556

""There are so many great shows we don't have yet."" More shows and movies are needed to continue adding subscribers, Hastings said. That includes paying up for originals. Netflix paid $60 million for Brad Pitt's ""War Machine,"" which it released in theaters and on demand at the same time. Big movie theater chains have been reluctant to screen movies that appear on streaming services on the same date, but Hastings said consumer demand may change that in the future. ""We hope that over time that the theaters will wake up and say we should provide consumer choice,"" he said. Competition from other streaming services and premium networks, which also are seeking original content, has driven up costs. ""It's been great for talent and writers,"" said Hastings. ""There is so much competition. All the new players and the existing players like HBO are beginning to grow. It is this new age of television."" Netflix has kept its base monthly price at $7.99 for eight years.

She even had her own Cooking Channel show, ""Tia Mowry at Home."" But for her latest project ""Tia Mowry's Quick Fix,"" the actress took her talents to Facebook, YouTube and other online platforms. ""Working in the business for over 25 years, the thing about network television, you're fitting or trying to fit into their thing or into their umbrella,"" Mowry told CNBC, in an interview. ""You have to mold yourself and conform yourself to fit into their brand, and I realized soon I don't want to really have to do that. I just want to be 100 percent myself, and I know my audience more than anybody."" ""Quick Fix"" consists of 10- to 12-minutes episodes about life hacks that Mowry has picked up from being a working, multitasking mom, whether it's a cooking recipe or parenting tip. She's built up 1.1 million followers on Facebook and more than 390,000 subscribers on YouTube. The most successful episode, about Mowry's newborn baby girl, has been viewed 12.7 million times on Facebook, and still gets about 500,000 views a week. ""We are now in a generation where everything is on the smartphone,"" Mowry said. ""You have women who aren't just staying home watching television. You have women who are on the go who are working and multitasking the hell out of things. They need something that is tangible and is not so time consuming."" In short, ""when you are a busy mom you don't have time to watch an hour of something to figure out what to cook,"" she said. ""Quick Fix"" is among a slate of reality and competition shows that Kin, an entertainment company, is making in partnership with actors, musicians and celebrities who got started on television. They're now bypassing TV and going directly to their social media followings, while making money in the process. All the Kin lifestyle shows together generated between $500,000 and $1 million in revenue in first year, with the majority coming from its first project ""Quick Fix"" according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the numbers are confidential. With more series debuting, year two projections are in the multimillions of dollars, they added.  ""It's undeniable that these talents have a very powerful direct connection with audiences,"" said Michael Wayne, CEO of Kin. ""Most of them have built large social followings. They use it for promotion or to share with their audience things that are going on with their lives. But they haven't looked at creating a business around that direct connection."" In addition to ""Quick Fix,"" Kin produced ""All Things Adrienne, "" with singer and actress Adrienne Bailon, known for her work in girl groups 3LW and The Cheetah Girls, in April. ""Life in Motion with Derek Hough,"" featuring the performer from ""Dancing with the Stars,"" was added this year, along with ""Heart of the Batter with Jordin Sparks,"" who started out in ""American Idol,"" and ""Beauty School Knockout with Vanessa Lachey,"" hosted by the model and television personality. Kin's latest series, ""Engaged with Jojo and Jordan,"" debuted in early October, featuring a couple from ABC's ""The Bachelorette."" The shows launch on Facebook or YouTube and eventually make their way to Instagram TV, Amazon Prime and other places. The goal is to have 20 shows by 2019, with some episodes going longer than 20 minutes, Wayne said. The company has its own studio, equipment and teams so it can keep costs low while maintaining TV quality. ""We want to be the next generation cable network,"" Wayne said. In addition to greater control over their projects, the entertainers also have a bigger stake in the profits than in traditional TV deals, Wayne added. Shows make money through brand integrations and affiliate links on Amazon as well as commercials. There's also an opportunity to sign licensing deals online and potentially get programs syndicated on TV. Kin may even get into events in the future. ""They're drawn to being a part of something that looks as good as TV,"" Wayne said. ""It's not surprising we're getting great viewership. The consumers want it. I think the platforms want it. The stars are aligning for these type of shows."" One downside to the online medium is the speed and quantity of negative feedback that shows receive, which can include bullying. But it can also be used to find out which investments are worth making, Wayne said. The goal is to recoup investment and make each show profitable in the first six to 12 months — and if it doesn't work, there are no obligations to continue, he said. ""I've been in this business ever since I was 12 years old,"" Mowry said. ""At the end of the day, you do not own it. It's not your baby. The whole thing about the whole digital space is there's more room for that. The social media gods allow you to have more control of your baby, because it's 100 percent me.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/14/how-tia-mowry-is-having-a-comeback-thanks-to-facebook-youtube-series.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,846

2018-10-19 13:00:00,2018,10.0,19,Researchers Finally Proved Quantum Computers are More Powerful Than Classical Computers,"For the first time, an international team of researchers has proven that quantum computers offer a computational advantage over classical computers.  As detailed in a paper published Thursday in  Science, the researchers designed a quantum circuit that was able to solve a math problem that would be impossible for a classical computer to solve when subject to the same constraints.  “Our work shows that quantum circuits are computationally more powerful than classical ones of the same structure,” Robert König, a complexity theorist at the Technical University of Munich and lead author of the paper, told me in an email. “We are not saying that the problem cannot be solved classically. It can, though this requires more resources.”  The team was able to achieve quantum advantage due to “nonlocality,” a feature of spatially isolated quantum systems that allows them to be considered a single system: a change in one system instantaneously results in a change in another.  Qubits are the quantum analog of bits in a classical computer, except rather being either a one or a zero, qubits can be in a “superposition” of both states at the same time.  When designing quantum circuits, there’s a tradeoff between the number of qubits interacting in the circuit and the number of operations that can be performed on those qubits, also known as the “depth” of the circuit. Increasing the number of qubits or the “depth” of a quantum circuit will increase its information-processing abilities.  But increasing one of these parameters demands a corresponding decrease in the other. A circuit with a large number of qubits that would be difficult to simulate with a classical computer is limited to a small number of operations (it has a “shallow” depth), which makes its advantage over classical computers difficult to prove.  This is because a quantum circuit that doesn’t incorporate error correction is limited in the number of operations that can be performed on the qubits before they succumb to noise and decohere, losing their information content. As more qubits are thrown into the mix, there’s more room for error, resulting in a drop in the number of operations that can be performed before they decohere. In this case, König and his colleagues designed a quantum circuit in which several shallow circuits operate in parallel, yet can still be considered to be a single system due to nonlocality. These shallow circuits were able to solve an algebra problem using a fixed number of operations (that is, they had a “constant depth”) which is mathematically impossible for a classical circuit with a constant depth.  Large-scale quantum computers are expected to dramatically outperform even the most powerful classical supercomputers by leveraging properties of quantum mechanics such as superposition and nonlocality. These advantages will, in theory, allow future quantum computers to perform certain types of calculations far faster than a classical computer. Shor’s algorithm, for instance, allows quantum computers to efficiently find the prime factors for a given number and may eventually allow quantum computers with a large number of qubits to crack most modern forms of encryption. Classical computers, on the other hand, wouldn’t be able to crack that encryption before the heat death of the universe, even with all the computing power on Earth.  Interestingly, one of the most vexing problems for scientists studying quantum computing is the ability to say when a quantum computer has definitively outstripped the abilities of a classical computer. For example, Shor’s algorithm is able to factor primes more efficiently than a classical computer, whichdoesn’t necessarily mean the same level efficiency is impossible to achieve with a classical computer. It could be the case that the right method simply hasn’t been discovered yet.  This brings us to the realm of complexity theory, which is inhabited by researchers probing the boundary between classical and quantum computers. Although complexity theory has plenty of conjectures as to why various quantum algorithms are beyond the reach of classical computers, these conjectures haven’t been proved—until now.  König and his colleagues see their work as laying the mathematical foundations for practical, experimental applications in the near future. Unlike many quantum algorithms that are so complex that they can only be implemented on a large-scale quantum computer, these shallow quantum computing circuits were designed to be within the grasp of experimental quantum computers in the near future.  “Experimental realization of such circuits will require additional considerations, including a study of the effects of noise and an optimization of the number of qubits required,” König told me. “Our work is a proof-of-principle showing that quantum computers can indeed be better at solving a certain problem. This is good to know, but in practice, we'd like to address less contrived problems that appear in other areas of science.”",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/evw93z/researchers-finally-proved-quantum-computers-are-more-powerful-than-classical-computers,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,788
2020-02-28 00:00:00,2020,2.0,28,Amazon defers 'non-essential' moves even in U.S. as corporate travel bans spread,"(Reuters) - Amazon.com deferred all non-essential travel, within the U.S. and beyond, and Google set new restrictions for travel to South Korea and other places, as corporations moved to protect employees from the spread of coronavirus. Coronavirus fears have intensified in recent days since countries besides China have reported a sharp increase in cases, with six countries reporting their first cases. Amazon is one of the latest companies to clamp down on travel because of the outbreak, which has caused at least 2,797 deaths globally. Google is banning travel to Iran and two Italian regions, Lombardy and the Veneto, where the virus is spreading. The company will also ban travel to South Korea and Japan, from March 2, a spokesman for the company confirmed. Canada’s TD Bank Group told Reuters it was suspending all non-essential business travel to China, Iran, Italy, Japan, South Korea and Singapore. Its peer Bank of Nova Scotia has also reportedly halted non-essential travel. JetBlue which flies in the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America, became the first U.S. airline to offer waivers for all travel on Wednesday, announcing it would suspend change and cancellation fees for new flight bookings between Feb. 27 and March 11 this year. Facebook Inc also said it would cancel its annual developer conference in May because of the virus. Wall Street has plunged on fears of a likely pandemic. New reported infections around the world now exceed those from mainland China, where the flu-like disease arose two months ago. Amazon’s decision affects one of the largest U.S. workforces. As of Dec. 31, the company employed 798,000 full and part-time workers globally. Dave Clark, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations, notified members of his team Thursday ahead of a wider communication by the company on Friday, a spokeswoman said. Previously Amazon had said it was putting travel restrictions to China in place. With this broader halt of employee work trips, it was not immediately clear how the company distinguished essential from non-essential travel. Other companies including London Stock Exchange Group, and U.S. grains trader Cargill Inc have also placed curbs on non-essential travel. Chipmaker Microchip Technology said it would not be attending any investor conferences in the rest of the current quarter, due to travel restrictions over the outbreak. Switzerland banned large events expected to draw more than 1,000 people, prompting cancellation of the Geneva car show. And, European airlines stepped up their warnings over the coronavirus outbreak, announcing cost cuts to help weather a storm of unknown severity and duration.

2018-10-05 12:08:00,2018,10.0,5,Many Treated after Man with Bacterial Meningitis Visits Sex Club,"Patrons who visited Berlin’s Kit Kat Club on Saturday were encouraged to seek treatment after a man who had also been in attendance that night was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis. After visiting a doctor on Monday, the man was quickly diagnosed with the disease and prescribed antibiotics for treatment, according to Bild newspaper. Patrick Larscheid, director of the Reinickendorf health department, also told the newspaper that the man had contact with two women in the club, who had both been given antibiotics that same day. The Reinickendorf health department also issued a statement on Tuesday, encouraging everybody who visited the club on Saturday to go to the emergency room or a see a doctor to receive medical treatment. The Kit Kat Club said over 100 people sought treatment, according to the BBC. The State Office for Health and Social Affairs Berlin announced on Thursday that no new cases had been reported, although several hundred people had sought medical treatment, according to Bild newspaper. The nightclub shares a name with the club at the center of the Broadway musical and 1972 movie Cabaret. On Saturday, the club hosted a “CarneBall Bizarre” party, according to its Facebook page, with a dress code of “fetish, patent and leather, uniforms, TV, goth, costumes, evening wear, glitz & glamour, extravagant clothes.” In a Facebook post on Tuesday, The Kit Kat Club said none of its employees exhibited any symptoms of bacterial meningitis but had still been offered antibiotics as a precaution. The club also shared that while they understood people’s concerns, there was no justification for people who had visited the club before Saturday — or were planning on visiting in the future — to have any fear about contracting bacterial meningitis. The club will be open this weekend. Death from meningitis, an infection of the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord (called meninges), can occur in just a few hours, according to the CDC, and while most people recover, they may be left with permanent impairments such as brain damage, hearing loss and learning disabilities. Bacterial meningitis caused 500 deaths in about 4,100 cases in the United States each year between 2003 and 2007. According to the CDC, symptoms include nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and confusion. These signs can develop over the course of several days, usually appearing in three to seven days after exposure.",https://people.com/health/kit-kat-club-bacterial-meningitis/,health,People,health,394
2017-08-18 00:00:00,2017,8.0,18,Is coconut oil good for you?," (CNN)According to a recent survey, 72% of Americans think coconut oil is a healthy food.  But despite popular health claims about coconut oil, a report from the American Heart Association recently advised against its use, stating that it increases LDL cholesterol (a cause of cardiovascular disease) and has no known offsetting effects. ""There are many claims being made about coconut oil being wonderful for lots of different things, but we really don't have any evidence of long-term health benefits,"" said Dr. Walter C. Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.  How exactly, then, does coconut oil rank among oils? ""Coconut oil is somewhere in the middle of the spectrum in terms of types of fats. It's probably better than partially hydrogenated oils (which are) high in trans fats but not as good as the more unsaturated plant oils that have proven health benefits, like olive and canola oil,"" Willett said.  ""It's probably not quite as 'bad' as butter but not as good as extra virgin olive oil,"" agreed Kevin Klatt, a molecular nutrition researcher at Cornell University who is studying the metabolic effects of coconut oil. Klatt cautions that we should not develop too strong of an opinion about coconut oil without more data. ""But at the same time, you have to be evidence-based ... and (currently), the evidence reflects benefits for olive oil, fish, nuts and seeds -- so that should be the focus in the diet.""  What's in coconut oil? Coconut oil is extracted from the meat of the fruit. It contains mostly saturated fat, which is also found in large quantities in butter and red meat. Like other saturated fats, coconut oil increases LDL cholesterol, the ""bad"" cholesterol associated with increased risk of heart disease. In fact, coconut oil has more saturated fat and raises LDL more than butter, according to Willett.  But coconut oil does a particularly nice job of raising HDL, the ""good"" cholesterol, especially when replacing carbohydrates in the diet. This may be due to its high content of a fatty acid known as lauric acid.  ""Coconut oil is half lauric acid, which is a little bit unique,"" Klatt said, as the acid seems to raise HDL more than other saturated fats and is rarely found in such high amounts in foods.  Still, though the increase in HDL seen with consumption of coconut oil may offset some of the disease risk, it's still not as good as consuming unsaturated oils, which not only raise HDL but lower LDL, according to Willett. Complicating matters is the fact that we still don't know for sure what exactly a high HDL translates to in terms of health risk. ""There's been debate about the role of HDL,"" Willett cautioned. ""Partly because there are many forms of HDL which have different health consequences ... which has made the water murky."" For example, there are different forms of HDL that do different things. One role is to help take LDL cholesterol out of the bloodstream. ""But some forms of HDL don't do that,"" Willett said, ""so we don't know for sure that higher HDL is better."" And while it's true that an elevated LDL level is only a risk factor for heart disease and doesn't always translate to heart attacks, it's still cause for concern. ""High LDL is a risk factor, but it strongly predicts negative health events,"" Willett said. There is extremely preliminary evidence that the increase in LDL may not be as pronounced if one consumes extra virgin coconut oil instead of refined coconut oil, according to Klatt. For example, polyphenols present in unrefined oils may help to blunt the effects on LDL. But ""the effects of extra virgin compared to refined coconut oil and other common oils require further study,"" he cautioned. Coconut oil and weight loss Some research suggests that coconut oil may be helpful in reducing belly fat, at least in the short term. One study found that coconut oil was associated with reduced waist circumference (belly fat) compared with soybean oil.  Participants also consumed a lot more fiber, followed a low-calorie diet and walked for about an hour each day. ""Even if coconut oil does help reduce belly fat, it doesn't necessarily outweigh the concern about its effect on lipids, specifically LDL,"" Klatt said.  Other research has touted benefits such as increased metabolism, reduced appetite or improved cognitive function associated with fats known as MCTs, or medium chain triglycerides, which are present in coconut oil. ""You can't infer from ... studies what coconut oil will and will not do. We need better controlled trials,"" Klatt said. ""Right now, the internet is jumping the gun and going way beyond the evidence."" Coco-calories Like other oils, coconut oil is calorie-dense, which means consuming large amounts without reducing other calorie sources can lead to weight gain. Just one tablespoon has 120 calories, about the same as a large apple or four cups of air-popped popcorn. ""Oil is a really easy way to increase the energy density of a food. Things like almonds have a lot of fat, but it's easier to overeat pure oil than overeat pure almonds,"" Klatt said. In small amounts, however, coconut oil can have a place in one's diet.  ""It's not that you have to absolutely avoid coconut oil but rather limit coconut oil to where you really need that special flavor, like for Thai food or for baking a special dessert,"" Willett said.  ""If you love using butter and need a hard fat, coconut oil may be a better choice and is certainly fine to consume occasionally, when a recipe calls for it,"" Klatt added. But for day-to-day use, vegetable oils such as olive, canola or soybean oil, along with nuts and seeds, should be your primary fats. ""These have better effects on blood cholesterol and long-term studies showing reduced risk of heart disease,"" Willett said. Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist, author and health journalist.

Fox in Back to The Future II. According to a tweet from the company's Heidi Burgett, the HyperAdapt 1.0 will be available for ""experience & purchase"" starting on the 28th of November, but only in select Nike locations in the US. Pricing is still unknown, but expect a ""high price tag,"" according to a Wired feature on the shoe's development. you have to charge these shoes You can check out the full story from Wired for a more detailed look at how the sneakers were made, but here are the key points. Each shoe has an internal cable system made from fishing line and a pressure sensor in the sole. When you put your foot in, the cables tighten based on ""an algorithmic pressure equation,"" and this fit can be adjusted throughout the day with a pair of buttons near the tongue. LEDs in the heel light up when the shoes are tightening and when it's on low battery, and all the internal electronics mean that yes, you do have to charge these shoes. It takes three hours for a full charge and each charge last about two weeks, with Nike providing a magnetic clip-on charger similar to that used by Apple for the Apple Watch. It's also worth noting that the thick nylon laces you see on the top of the sneaker are just ""visual aids"" — they tighten, but they're not what's keeping the shoe hugged to your foot. You can watch the video below from Wired for a closer look:  Nike has been teasing these shoes for years now, first auctioning off a non-functional pair that were replicas of the Back to The Future props in 2011. (Side-note: these props were placed on a platform with crewmembers underneath that pulled on wires to tighten the laces by hand.) Then, last October, Nike designer Tinker Hatfield sent a working prototype to Fox himself. In March this year, the company announced a more streamlined-looking consumer version actually intended for the mass market, and these are the HyperAdapts that go on sale in November.",https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/21/12998474/buy-nike-self-lacing-shoes-hyperadapt-1,Tech,The Verge,technology,364
2019-10-16 00:00:00,2019,10.0,16,Libra's co-creator touts progress after exodus of the crypto backers,"The co-creator of Facebook-backed libra defended the cryptocurrency on Wednesday after a number of recent high-profile companies abandoned the effort. Libra ran into issues Friday after Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, eBay and Mercado Pago bolted. Booking Holdings, formerly Priceline, left Monday. Each of the companies would have potentially invested $10 million each into the project. The digital currency will not be run by Facebook, but rather by a nonprofit association supported by a range of companies and organizations. ""It wasn't a tough week,"" said David Marcus, head of Facebook's Calibra digital wallet, which can serve as a way to store and exchange Libra. Calibra won't be the only wallet. It will interact with other Libra-accepted platforms. ""I would rather have all of these companies come with us,"" he added, saying that he understands companies have to respect shareholders who are skeptical of the digital coin. Instead, Marcus pointed to Libra's progress in a ""Squawk Box"" interview. The founding members, including Uber, Lyft and Spotify, held their first meeting on Monday in Geneva, Switzerland where they settled on an organizational structure and a five-seat board of directors, including Marcus and representatives from Libra-backer Andreessen Horowitz, a leading Silicon Valley venture capital firm. The goal of Libra — using blockchain, the technology underlying bitcoin on other cryptocurrencies — is to make it as easy to send money across the world as it is to send a photo. But unlike bitcoin and others, Libra will be backed by more stable government-backed money. Governments so far have been skeptical of the digital coin, with policymakers around the world upping pressure on libra. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is set to face Congress next week to answer questions on libra. Though Marcus stressed on Wednesday that the project is just that: an idea with room for improvement. Libra, which was announced in June, is aiming to launch in the first half of 2020. ""It's kind of odd that all of this is happening at the stage of this project because it's a project. It's an idea. It's a whitepaper. Nothing is operating yet,"" he said when asked about the political pressure. ""It's kind of sad in a way to see all the issues that we currently have with the current system."" Marcus, testifying before House lawmakers, also indicated in July that the group fully plans to move forward with libra. When asked by Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., whether Facebook would postpone its launch plans until regulations were in place, Marcus didn't give a definitive answer. Waters said his answer ""was not a commitment.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/16/libras-co-creator-touts-progress-after-exodus-of-the-crypto-backers.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,426
2016-08-31 11:43:28,2016,8.0,31,"Daily Report: Uber and Google, Ride-Sharing ‘Frenemies’","Bits Silicon Valley is a bit like junior high school. Sometimes friends become enemies. Enemies become friends. And “frenemies” stay somewhere in between — just don’t share a secret with them. So it is with Alphabet, Google’s parent company and arguably the most influential company in the tech industry, and Uber, the still young ride-hailing service that also happens to be one the most valuable privately held companies in the world. On Monday, Uber announced that David Drummond had recently stepped down from its board after serving on it for three years. The tech news site The Information reported that Mr. Drummond, a longtime Google executive, had been prohibited from attending some directors’ meetings and from learning some company secrets, given the growing tension between the companies. On Tuesday, reports surfaced that Google was inching closer to becoming an Uber competitor. For some time, Google has been testing a ride-sharing service near its headquarters, in Mountain View, Calif. Soon that program is expected to expand to San Francisco. There may have been a time when Google and Uber were friends. GV, the current name of Alphabet’s investment arm, invested in Uber, after all. Uber certainly benefited from working with Google’s mobile operating system, and it has long used Google’s maps (though it is working on its own now). But somewhere along the way, the two started to drift apart. Google has been working on a self-driving-car project for years and has been testing the vehicles on the streets of Silicon Valley. Last year, Uber hired some of the best minds in the autonomous-vehicle world from Carnegie Mellon University and created its own self-driving-car research center. And last week, Uber acquired a self-driving-truck start-up founded and heavily populated by — you guessed it — former Google employees. To top it off, Uber plans to start testing self-driving Uber cars in Pittsburgh next month. Google has a history of executives who serve on the boards of companies that could soon be competitors, of course. Eric E. Schmidt, Alphabet’s executive chairman, was a member of Apple’s board when his company was developing Android, a direct competitor to the Apple iPhone. Steve Jobs, legend has it, was not very happy about it. So perhaps that junior high lesson stands: Watch what you say around your frenemies.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/01/technology/daily-report-uber-and-google-ride-sharing-frenemies.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,382
2019-09-05 00:00:00,2019,9.0,5,"Anti-vax pet owners are putting their animals' health at risk, vets fear","London (CNN)More pet owners are failing to vaccinate their animals, new figures show, and a UK animal charity is describing the growing problem as a ""ticking time bomb"" for pets.  Millions of animals are being left unprotected and vulnerable to potentially fatal diseases such as cat flu, rabbit viral hemorrhagic disease and parvovirus, according to the charity PDSA, with vets fearing that the anti-vax phenomenon is spreading to animals.  The number of domestic animals protected has seen a dramatic decline in recent years, according to the 2019 PDSA Animal Wellbeing (PAW) Report. The survey of 5,036 dog, cat and rabbit owners in Britain found that only two thirds (66%) of pets received their primary vaccinations when young, compared with 84% in 2016.  Furthermore, the report also revealed that about a third of pets (32%) are not getting their regular boosters, which ensure longer-term protection.  The 18 percentage point decrease over just three years could mean more than 7 million pets are now vulnerable to infection, according to the charity.  Creep of anti-vax sentiment into animal care The worrying fall coincides with the growth in the anti-vaxxer movement, with some parents expressing skepticism about the safety and efficacy of childhood vaccines. Such resistance has been described as ""vaccine hesitancy"" and was listed by the  World Health Organization in its list of Top 10 Threats to Global Health in 2019.  Daniella Dos Santos, the British Veterinary Association's junior vice president, said the findings came as no surprise: ""Vets are deeply concerned about the creep of anti-vax sentiments into animal care. Our member survey found that 98% of vets have been questioned by clients about the need for vaccination.""  ""We always welcome questions from clients but we're worried that these conversations are being heavily influenced by what pet owners are seeing online from unreliable sources. Vaccination is vital in protecting pets from preventable and potentially fatal diseases that can be devastating for families."" Sean Wensley, a PDSA senior vet, called the decline in pet vaccinations ""extremely worrying."" ""Vaccinations have helped to protect millions of pets from serious diseases such as parvovirus, cat flu and Rabbit Viral Haemorrhagic Disease,"" he said. ""If people don't vaccinate, we risk seeing a rise in extremely unpleasant, preventable, diseases that can cause considerable animal suffering and death."" Pet owners gave a variety of reasons for failing to ensure their animals receive the right injections.  Of those who did not vaccinate, 17% deemed it ""too expensive,"" while the same proportion argued that their pet did not come into contact with other animals. A slightly lower proportion (16%) said they felt it was ""unnecessary,"" while 13% said that their ""pet found going to the vet very stressful."" Alice Jackson's pet kitten Mr. Meowgi recently died from Feline Leukemia virus (FeLV), a loss she described as ""incredibly distressing,"" for both herself and her son.  ""He was an indoor cat and never usually went outside, but one day he escaped and went missing, even though we're always careful not to let him get out,"" she said. ""If I'd have known a vaccination course would have saved his life I would have had this sorted immediately. Seeing him deteriorate so quickly was so traumatic. My son is autistic and had developed a close bond with him, and having to say goodbye to him has broken all of our hearts.""

Trump spoke to reporters in an Oval Office meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar a day after imposing sweeping measures to prevent people from 26 European countries - except for Britain and Ireland - from traveling to the United States in a bid to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Trump said he had excluded Britain from the curbs because it was doing a good job in tackling the coronavirus. He said he was unable to consult with European officials before implementing the restrictions because he had to move quickly. Trump said it was possible the United States would need to extend the curbs of travel from Europe beyond the current 30 days but could also could shorten the restrictions, which have angered European leaders. The Republican president also said says he did not support a coronavirus economic relief bill the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives plans to vote on Thursday because it includes unrelated issues. He said be believed the stock market, which entered bear market territory this week, would bounce back from recent falls. Trump added that he was not yet ready to invoke emergency disaster powers over the outbreak. The president said he did not shake hands with Varadkar at their meeting because of the coronavirus.

2016-08-05 00:00:00,2016,8.0,5,Families and doctors who care for trans kids get help at conference,"By Andrew M. Seaman (Reuters Health) - At the annual Gender Odyssey conference this week in Seattle, parents and healthcare providers who care for transgender and gender-nonconforming children are receiving a crash course on a world often left unexplored. Gender Odyssey began 15 years ago in Seattle as a collection of people discussing transgender and gender-nonconforming issues, but it has since ballooned to include programming specifically for families and healthcare providers. This week, more than 1,200 attendees are expected. “I wanted us to come together and give and take,” said Aidan Key, who founded the conference. The goal of the professional programming is to advance medical standards and guidelines. Meanwhile, the family programming focuses on parents’ and children’s experiences, and their future. Parents “feel like they’re having to advocate for their children in an arena they never thought they’d have to navigate,” Key told Reuters Health. “At the very least, what I want them to know is that their child can have a fantastic future,” said Key. “I want them to be able to leave and have a connection that will help sustain them throughout the year.” After not finding the right fit among a few support groups, Evelyn Montanez, a mother and teacher from Redmond, Washington, came to Gender Odyssey in 2015 at the suggestion of a family member. This year at Gender Odyssey, Montanez said she’ll be paying special attention to sessions about medical care and insurance as her son, who is transgender, enters college. “It’s an incredible safe space to talk about our experiences and a space to share positive things,” said Montanez. “Last year was positively overwhelming,” she said. “There was so much information I was learning. All the workshops were amazing, but what stood out to me was the student panel – the kids. It was really good for me as a mom to see where the kids are at different stages.” There are no national estimates of the number of transgender or gender diverse youth in the U.S., but The Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law says about 1.4 million U.S. adults identify as transgender. This year, medical professionals attending Gender Odyssey are offered sessions on barriers to care for transgender and gender-nonconforming youth, talking to young children about gender, and hormone use among gender diverse youths. Medical school curricula currently devote only about five hours to issues affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities, said Dr. Aron Janssen, who is clinical director of the gender and sexuality service at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. “As physicians at least we have an ethical responsibility to treat the patients who come through our doors,” said Janssen. “It’s not an excuse to say you haven’t been trained.” Janssen said healthcare providers, parents and children can all benefit from conferences like Gender Odyssey, but for those who can’t attend, online resources are available. He usually recommends Gender Spectrum (www.genderspectrum.org) and TransYouth Family Allies (www.imatyfa.org). According to Key, one of the most powerful and consistent benefits for children and families is meeting other people with similar backgrounds. “You can immediately find kinship and find someone who understands your experience,” he said. Montanez said her goal this year is to exchange phone numbers and email addresses with two families at the conference who live outside the Seattle area. “I think now that I’m going to be an empty nester, I want to be more involved with communities and families,” she told Reuters Health. “I think it’s important to hear they’re not alone and they have friends going through the same thing.” Every person develops a gender identity, Janssen said, and that identity doesn’t always align with what is typically portrayed in the media and online. “There is beauty in that diversity,” he said.

2019-11-26 00:00:00,2019,11.0,26,Palo Alto falls on disappointing profit forecast,"(Reuters) - Shares of Palo Alto Networks fell nearly 11% after the cyber security company forecast disappointing second-quarter profit, prompting at least four brokerages to cut their price targets on weakness in its products business. The company’s products unit, which sells firewalls and threat detection and prevention software, has come under pressure as more customers switch to the cloud. Sales in the division fell nearly 4% in the first quarter ended Oct. 31, their first drop in at least 11 quarters. J.P. Morgan said the magnitude and timing of the over stimulating focus on cloud security products left the firewall pipeline drained for the first quarter. Palo Alto has looked to cushion the hit by going on an acquisition spree. The company bought IoT security providers Zingbox and Twistlock this year and said on Monday that it was buying Aporeto Inc for $150 million to strengthen its cloud security platform. However, not all Wall Street analysts were bearish. “Palo Alto’s customers may be migrating some of their security concerns away from its firewall appliances; however, we expect customers to remain with the company,” said Morningstar analyst Mark Cash. The company said in September the increasing popularity of its cloud security tool, Prisma Access, had raised its confidence to achieve a 20% compounded annual growth rate for billings and revenue over the three-year period. “We believe the company’s strategic view on security and centering their offering around machine learning and automated responses, will fuel its growth engine into future fiscal years,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said.

2018-10-11 00:00:00,2018,10.0,11,Scientists in China breed mice from two females," (CNN)Researchers in China say they've bred healthy mice with two mothers using a new type of gene editing technology, a significant feat that may help researchers better understand mammalian reproduction but carries significant ethical and safety questions. A total of 29 bimaternal mice were produced using 210 embryos in the study. They all were ""normal, lived to adulthood, and had babies of their own,"" though they showed ""some defective features,"" according to researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. But not all the mice pups survived the experiment. Mice produced from two fathers only survived a couple of days after being born.  ""This research shows us what's possible,"" Wei Li, one of the study's co-authors, said in a news release.  ""We saw that the defects in bimaternal mice can be eliminated and that bipaternal reproduction barriers in mammals can also be crossed through imprinting modification,"" said Wei Li. ""We also revealed some of the most important imprinted regions that hinder the development of mice with same sex parents, which are also interesting for studying genomic imprinting and animal cloning."" The scientists conducting the study, published in the journal Cell Stem Cell Thursday, said they were interested in answering why some reptiles, fish and amphibians can reproduce with one parent of the same sex, but others cannot.  The genes were removed using CRISPR Cas9, a tool that experts say has the potential to save countless lives and billions of dollars but has raised serious ethical questions about the future of genetic research. The idea of ""designer babies"" -- in which parents can choose genetic traits -- is one example, but some have warned that editing individual human genes could affect the gene pool in future generations and carry unintended consequences. Scientists say that despite the potential of the latest study, the technology just isn't ready for practical application. ""The tremendous amount of genetic modification needed in order to do what they (Chinese researchers) did, makes it implausible to use it in anything other than research,"" said Dr. Tim Hore, an expert in epigenetics and development at the University of Otago. ""To consider exploring similar technology for human application in the near future is implausible,"" said Dusko Ilic, Reader in Stem Cell Science at King's College London. ""The risks of severe abnormalities is too high, and it would take years of research in various animal models to fully understand how this could be done safely.""

2018-08-06 00:00:00,2018,8.0,6,"Beyoncé, Serena Williams bring attention to risks of childbirth for black women"," (CNN)To many, Beyoncé is the history-making superstar who ""runs the world"" with 22 Grammy Awards to her name -- and hot sauce in her bag. Yet last year, on the day she gave birth to twins Rumi and Sir, she faced a health scare.  Queen Bey was swollen from what she called ""toxemia"" or preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication that involves high blood pressure and protein in the urine, estimated to affect about 3.4% of pregnancies in the United States. Due to the complication, 36-year-old Beyoncé had been on bed rest for more than a month before having an emergency cesarean section because her and her babies' health were in danger, she said in Vogue magazine's September issue, which debuted online Monday. ""Today I have a connection to any parent who has been through such an experience. After the C-section, my core felt different. It had been major surgery,"" said Beyoncé, who also was featured on the magazine's cover. ""Some of your organs are shifted temporarily, and in rare cases, removed temporarily during delivery. I am not sure everyone understands that. I needed time to heal, to recover,"" she said. ""During my recovery, I gave myself self-love and self-care, and I embraced being curvier. I accepted what my body wanted to be."" Similarly, Serena Williams underwent an emergency C-section last year. Williams, a history-making tennis star with four Olympic gold medals, also made a cameo in Beyoncé's visual album ""Lemonade"" in 2016. Yet last year, after the 36-year-old gave birth to daughter Olympia, she developed blood clots in her lungs. In an opinion article that Williams wrote for CNN in February, she described how she ""almost died."" Williams has a history of blood clots and stopped taking her blood-thinning medication in order to help her C-section wound heal. ""What followed just 24 hours after giving birth were six days of uncertainty,"" she wrote. Those days included a pulmonary embolism, or blood clots in the lung, that led to such intense coughing that Williams' C-section wound popped open. ""I returned to surgery, where the doctors found a large hematoma, a swelling of clotted blood, in my abdomen. And then I returned to the operating room for a procedure that prevents clots from traveling to my lungs. When I finally made it home to my family, I had to spend the first six weeks of motherhood in bed,"" Williams wrote. ""I am so grateful I had access to such an incredible medical team of doctors and nurses at a hospital with state-of-the-art equipment. They knew exactly how to handle this complicated turn of events,"" she wrote. ""If it weren't for their professional care, I wouldn't be here today."" The two women's chaotic and frightening childbirth experiences are all too real for the thousands of women in the US and around the world who face such complications during childbirth -- complications that some don't survive. Every day, about 830 women around the globe die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth, according to the World Health Organization. In the United States, about 700 women die each year as a result of pregnancy or delivery complications, and the risk of pregnancy-related deaths among black women is three to four times higher than among white women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Black women often suffer more of these than do white women, in particularly the hypertensive diseases. So chronic hypertension, preeclampsia during pregnancy are more common among black women than white women,"" said Dr. Elizabeth Howell, an obstetrician-gynecologist and professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who was not involved in Beyoncé's nor Serena Williams' care. Beyoncé's and Williams' pregnancy stories have garnered much attention among men and women alike, with several people tweeting about the women's bravery in opening up. ""Thank you to Serena, and now Beyoncé, for opening up about pregnancy complications and the toll it took on them. Everyone deserves access to healthcare, and to make their own pregnancy decisions,"" wrote Dr. Daniel Grossman, director of the University of California, San Francisco's Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, in a Twitter post on Monday. Marissa Evans, a journalist for the Texas Tribune, wrote in a Twitter post on Monday that having both Beyoncé and Williams talk about their pregnancy complications as black women within months of each other is ""powerful"" and shows how ""maternal morbidity is unkind to so many black moms."" To reduce this disparity, Howell said, there have been efforts to establish standardized protocols, called patient safety bundles, across hospitals in the US.   ""We have what we call bundles that we're doing within hospitals right now to try to target those conditions, to standardize care, to make sure that people get the appropriate care, and there's less variation,"" Howell said. ""So that's something that's important that we stress and make sure that our patients are aware of, that hospitals are now implementing these."" She added that advocacy -- whether it's a patient advocating for herself or women advocating for each other -- also remains important in addressing issues related to maternal health and maternal mortality. In Williams' case, she said that she had to push her medical team to conduct a CT scan in order to check for clots. ""Every mother, everywhere, regardless of race or background deserves to have a healthy pregnancy and birth. And you can help make this a reality,"" Williams wrote in her CNN opinion article in February. ""How? You can demand governments, businesses and health care providers do more to save these precious lives. You can donate to UNICEF and other organizations around the world working to make a difference for mothers and babies in need. In doing so, you become part of this narrative,"" she wrote.

2017-11-02 00:00:00,2017,11.0,2,Pandora earnings Q3 2017,"Pandora Media on Thursday reported mixed quarterly results. Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: In the year-ago quarter, the company reported an adjusted loss per share of 7 cents on revenue of $351.9 million. Advertising revenue, which accounts for the bulk of Pandora's overall revenue, grew 1 percent year over year but missed analyst expectations. Pandora reported $275.7 million in advertising revenue, which came in below analyst expectations of $289.3 million, according to StreetAccount. Pandora said that despite an increase in its average price per ad, it sold fewer ads in the quarter. In a conference call with investors following the earnings release, CFO Naveen Chopra said the company expected the headwinds affecting Pandora's advertising revenue in the third quarter, such as limitations in its ad technology, to continue in the fourth quarter. ""There's no silver bullet that's going to come in and solve these problems,"" CEO Roger Lynch said. He said investments in ad targeting and reporting technology would start to have an effect throughout 2018. The company reported 73.7 million active listeners in the third quarter, down from 77.9 million in the same period a year ago, a decrease for the third straight quarter. Listener hours were reported as 5.15 billion, down from 5.4 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The stock fell more than 6 percent in after-hours trade. The stock has struggled this year, falling more than 44 percent so far. The company reported that total subscribers reached 5.19 million in the quarter, representing 29 percent year-over-year growth. Wall Street had expected the company to report 5.04 million subscribers, according to StreetAccount. In October, premium subscribers crossed 1 million. A recent survey by consumer marketing firm Fluent found that Pandora is the second-most-popular audio streaming service in the United States after YouTube. About two-thirds of respondents who listen to streaming audio use Pandora, the survey said. Yet the music streaming market has become increasingly competitive. The Oakland, California-based company has to fend off digital music companies such as Spotify and Deezer, as well as giants such as Apple, Google and Amazon. Amid this competition, Pandora has struggled to monetize its user base. In March, the company launched a premium service for $9.99 a month. This offering lets users search for specific tracks and albums directly, allowing the company to better compete with those offered by Spotify and its competitors. In June, the music provider announced a $480 million investment from SiriusXM after rebuffing an offer to buy the company outright. In the same month, the company's co-founder and CEO Tim Westergren announced his plans to step down.

Now, as he departs the company following sexual misconduct allegations, he could leave with $0 in severance after working for the company for 24 years. Moonves resigned as CEO of CBS on Sunday evening after several reports alleging he had forced women into kissing him and demanded they perform other sexual activities. The most recent accounts were published in The New Yorker on Sunday, bringing the total number of accusers to at least 12. Moonves has denied the allegations and said the interactions were consensual. Moonves became CEO and president of CBS Corporation when it was founded in 2006 after spinning out of Viacom. He eventually became executive chairman in 2014. In total, Moonves received more than $650.2 million in total annual compensation for leading the company, according to various SEC filings. Previously, he led various divisions of CBS, starting as president of CBS Entertainment in 1995. He was promoted to president and CEO of CBS Television in 1998, eventually becoming chairman of CBS in 2003. He also was co-president and co-chief operating officer of Viacom in 2004 and held the role until CBS and Viacom were split. Sources told CNBC last week Moonves was negotiating a $100 million severance package if he were to leave CBS. However, in light of more allegations coming forward, he might receive no additional compensation, depending on the results of a CBS investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations. The company has put $120 million into a trust in order to pay any potential settlement, according to an SEC filing.  CBS also announced Moonves and the company will donate $20 million to one or more organizations that back the #MeToo movement and women's equality in the workplace. The funds will come out of any severance package Moonves will receive. Moonves also agreed to be an advisor for CBS Corp. for up to one year to aid with the transition to a new executive. However, CBS retained the right to end his employment earlier if its investigation finds the sexual misconduct reports are true.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/10/les-moonves-made-650-million-as-cbs-ceo-could-have-no-severance.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,357

According to Cunningham’s father, the metal rod had been found in the yard earlier by Cunningham and his friends, who stuck it in the ground so that no one would step on it. Instead, the skewer pierced Cunningham’s cheek, punctured his skull, and went through his head.“I heard screaming, and I went running down the stairs,” Cunningham’s mother, Gabrielle Miller, told the Kansas City Star. “He came in and he had this thing just sticking out.” The other end of the skewer extended about half a foot out from Cunningham’s face.According to Miller, once they left for the hospital, the boy said, “I’m dying, mom.” Miraculously, he was wrong. A medical team was able to safely remove the skewer from his face.Screenshot:  Kansas City Star“This thing had spared the eye, spared the brain, spared the spinal cord,” Koji Ebersole, director of endovascular neurosurgery at The University of Kansas Health System, told the Star. “But the major concern was the blood vessels in the neck.”Scans showed that the spike had missed major vessels. “You couldn’t draw it up any better,” said Ebersole. “It was one in a million for it to pass 5 or 6 inches through the front of the face to the back and not have hit these things.”Here’s a video of Ebersole discussing the operation:The surgery was further complicated by the square shape of the skewer, but the team was able to pull it out without causing any other damage. Ebersole estimated about a hundred people were involved in saving Cunningham.

2019-08-01 00:00:00,2019,8.0,1,Tesla owner discovers problem with ‘Dog Mode’ air conditioning feature ,"Elon Musk says Tesla is “fixing” a problem with its “Dog Mode” feature, which keeps pups cool while owners step away from the company’s cars, after a Twitter user discovered a way to inadvertently turn the feature off. Rahul Sood tweeted late Wednesday that he had turned Dog Mode on, tweaked the fan settings, and then left his seven-month-old Boxer pup in his Tesla Model X. When he later opened his Tesla app, though, he discovered — to his “horror,” he wrote — that the car’s interior temperature had jumped to 85 degrees because Dog Mode had turned off. He returned to the car to find his dog was okay, and then tweeted about the incident to both Musk and Tesla, and the CEO (who often solicits suggestions on Twitter) quickly responded: “Fixing...” Dog Mode was rolled out in February as an extension of Tesla’s “Cabin Overheat Protection” mode, which automatically cooled the cabin if it reached high temperatures in order to keep “babies or pets” safe, according to Musk. Dog Mode is a more proactive setting that the owner can choose. It automatically keeps the interior temperature cool and puts a message on the car’s touchscreen to tell passersby that the dogs are okay, and that their “owner will be back soon.” Fixing … Dog Mode is activated through the fan settings on Tesla’s touchscreens. Sood tells The Verge that the problem arose because, after activating Dog Mode, he then manually adjusted the fan setting to try to keep the car even cooler, since Seattle (where the incident took place) is in the middle of a heat wave. He said he kept monitoring his car through Tesla’s smartphone app, and says Dog Mode remained on at first. But after about 10 minutes, he noticed the temperature had jumped, because “basically the AC stops working in Dog Mode if you adjust the fan,” he writes. “Probably an easy fix but if I wasn’t watching him it would have been horrible.” Tesla is often lauded for adding new abilities to its cars with over-the-air software updates, from new driver assistance modes to video games and convenience features like Dog Mode. (And for what it’s worth, Sood says “the fact that the CEO responded as quickly as he did is pretty awesome.”) Not all of these rollouts go smoothly, like when Tesla had to pull the classic Atari game Pole Position from its cars because it hadn’t properly secured the rights. But the company is typically more careful with features that can put lives in danger, like how it recently delayed the release of an automatic parking mode called “Enhanced Summon.” Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. It’s not clear when the company will roll out the fix Musk referred to.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750085/tesla-dog-mode-flaw-elon-musk-software-update,Tech,The Verge,technology,462
2017-08-14 00:00:00,2017,8.0,14,"Marijuana for pain, PTSD: Studies find evidence lacking"," (CNN)Medical marijuana is now legal in 28 states and the District of Columbia. Increasingly, people are turning to cannabis to treat a range of symptoms and conditions, including nausea, bipolar disorder and seizures. But when it comes to using marijuana to treat chronic pain or post-traumatic stress disorder, two related reviews published Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine find little scientific evidence to support either its effectiveness or its safety.  Up to 80% of people who request medical marijuana want to ease pain, while more than a third cite PTSD as their primary reason, the US Department of Veterans Affairs researchers wrote, citing a separate recent small study.   As a result, physicians increasingly need to talk with patients about the potential benefits and harms of cannabis use, the authors note. Where can doctors turn for evidence-based material? More harm than good? The researchers found 27 studies that examined the use of cannabis products for chronic pain in adults. But they discovered insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about whether medical marijuana was helpful to pain sufferers, with one exception: neuropathic or nerve pain. Even there, the team found only weak evidence that cannabis alleviates chronic neuropathic pain. By contrast, they discovered sufficient evidence to conclude that cannabis use among the general population probably increased the risk of car accidents, psychotic symptoms and short-term cognitive impairment.  Next, the team reviewed data from two reviews and three studies assessing plant-based cannabis preparations used to treat PTSD among adults. Here, the authors found the available scientific studies to be flawed due to either small numbers of participants or a failure to include non-cannabis-using control groups.  Once again, the researchers decided the evidence was insufficient and not rigorous enough to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of cannabis in this patient population.  Worse still, one study of veterans with PTSD showed a small but ""significant"" worsening of symptoms among veterans who either started or continued using cannabis during the study period, the team said.   ""We found low- to moderate-strength evidence that cannabis use is associated with an increased risk for psychotic symptoms, psychosis, mania, and -- in active users -- short-term cognitive dysfunction,"" the authors noted. Schedule I substance Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said ""it is still too early to really understand how effective cannabis may be for chronic pain or PTSD or to fully understand the ways in which cannabis could provide relief.""   Additional research would take time, said Gupta, who was not involved in the new study but has reported on medical marijuana extensively in three CNN documentaries entitled ""Weed."" ""Weed 3,"" which first aired in 2015, gave viewers a front row seat to the first federally approved clinical study on the use of marijuana for PTSD.  With respect to the new research, Gupta said that scientists would need to first address safety issues and reliable, consistent dosing strategies.  Cannabis remains a Schedule I substance, the Drug Enforcement Administration classification for drugs believed to have a high potential for abuse along with some potential to create severe dependence. With federal restrictions placed on marijuana, scientists must overcome various legal and procedural hurdles to research it. Gupta noted, ""that makes these important studies harder to conduct.""  Dr. Dermot P. Maher, an assistant professor in the Johns Hopkins Department of Anesthesiology, noted that the authors searched several sources to identify ""under-reported results,"" which helped create a ""more complete picture"" of medical marijuana's possible treatment utility.   ""The potential benefits and harms of medical marijuana should be evaluated and compared against other available treatments, such as physical therapy, spine interventions, pain medications and surgery,"" Maher, who did not contribute to the review, wrote in an email. He added that the economic and societal ""costs"" of chronic pain emphasize ""the need to examine all available tools."" In an editorial accompanying the research, Dr. Sachin Patel of Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital noted that the findings are not unique. With very little quality evidence available, the efficacy of cannabis -- and cannabinoid products -- for treating pain and PTSD remains unknown.  One possible reason why some people find cannabis helpful in easing pain -- despite scientific evidence suggesting otherwise -- could be that the effects of cannabis depend on potency and dose, Patel wrote in an email. Meanwhile, most studies use lower doses and lower potencies of medical marijuana than what is found in dispensaries. ""Pain is a multifaceted symptom, which includes sensory, cognitive, and emotional components,"" he wrote. ""Perhaps cannabis decreases the clinical effect of chronic pain"" in ways unrecorded by pain rating scales. If scientists looked at emotional symptoms, such as anxiety, quality of life and sleep, instead of traditional symptoms, that ""may begin to tell us which specific areas of 'pain' are most likely going to be helped by cannabis, if any."" An everyday issue at the VA Jane Metrik, an associate professor at Brown University School of Public Health, calls the new research both ""timely"" and ""very well-done."" Though she did not contribute to the review, Metrik works as a clinical psychologist at the Providence VA Medical Center and routinely treats veterans with PTSD who use cannabis. ""It's a growing issue that VA providers are grappling with every day,"" she wrote in an email. Cannabis users often report a ""short-term alleviation of PTSD symptoms"": Sleep is easier, for example, and tension relieved.  Often, though, they become dependent on the drug, increasing both quantity and frequency, possibly leading to cannabis use disorder, which includes 11 behavioral symptoms outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5.  PTSD combined with cannabis use disorder ""is frequently associated with greater symptom severity, worse treatment outcomes, and increased use of health services,"" Metrik wrote. ""In light of insufficient evidence on the benefits of cannabis use in patients with PTSD, it is particularly important to increase access to evidence-based trauma-focused treatments for PTSD.""  In particular, the VA has highlighted prolonged exposure and cognitive processing therapies, while Metrik recommends cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia for veterans with problems sleeping. ""Veterans expect cannabis to provide relief from symptoms of combat-related trauma and perceive cannabis to be a low-risk or safe substance unlike other drugs,"" Metrik wrote. But ""the science behind the legislative action of legalizing medical cannabis as treatment for individuals with PTSD is lacking.""  She said controlled studies on its effectiveness and safety are needed to substantiate self-reported positive claims and ""to test whether benefits of using plant-based cannabis outweigh the risks.""

2017-08-07 00:00:00,2017,8.0,7,SoftBank mulls Uber or Lyft investment,"TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), a prolific investor in global technology startups, reported a sharp rise in quarterly profits and said it would be interested in parking funds in ride-hailing firms Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] or Lyft Inc in the future. This is the first time Softbank has publicly indicated an interest in Uber, after having so far put funds into its rival Grab in Southeast Asia and China’s Didi Chuxing. Last month, a media report said Uber shareholders and its board were mulling a stock sale to SoftBank and other investors. “We are interested in discussing with Uber, we are also interested in discussing with Lyft, we have not decided which way,” SoftBank’s CEO and founder Masayoshi Son said. “Whether we decide to partner and invest into Uber or Lyft, I don’t know what will be the end result,” he told reporters at SoftBank’s first-quarter earnings briefing on Monday. SoftBank said its quarterly operating profit rose 50 percent from a year ago to 479 billion yen ($4.32 billion) after it included Vision Fund, the world’s largest private equity fund, as a new reportable segment and booked a 105 billion yen gain on its stake in graphics chip maker Nvidia (NVDA.O). Vision Fund, backed by investors including Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, Apple (AAPL.O) and Foxconn (2317.TW), has raised more than $93 billion. Its backers expect technology investments that will match or beat the 44 percent internal rate of return that SoftBank says Son has delivered by investing in internet firms in the last 18 years. Longer term “if all goes well Vision Fund should contribute several hundred billion yen in annual revenue”, Son said. Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate puts SoftBank’s full-year profit at 1.16 trillion yen, based on estimates from 20 analysts. SoftBank, however, has not released a forecast for the current business year ending March, citing uncertainty. SoftBank’s wireless unit Sprint Corp (S.N), the No.4 U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers, is exploring options to boost finances through means such as a merger with T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) or a tie-up with cable provider Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O). Sprint, in which SoftBank has about an 80 percent stake, last week reported a quarterly profit for the first time in three years as a result of cost-cutting efforts. “There are multiple possible business consolidation partners and negotiations are ongoing,” Son said. He did not comment further as an announcement was likely in the “near future”. SoftBank shares ended up 2.4 percent before the quarterly results were announced, versus a small 0.5 percent gain in the wider index .N225 Reporting by Sam Nussey; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Himani Sarkar",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-softbank-group-results-uber/softbank-mulls-uber-or-lyft-investment-idUSKBN1AN0XW,Technology News,Reuters,technology,440

That's true no matter if it's your relatives -- or the local high school football team. When a cheerleader from Foothill High School in Palo Cedro, California, was diagnosed with leukemia, her football family stepped up big time.

Fritzsche spoke a day after The Wall Street Journal reported that Sprint has entered into exclusive talks with Charter and Comcast on a potential deal for the cable companies to offer wireless services on the carrier's network. CNBC's David Faber confirms talks are taking place, but his sources say any expectation either Comcast or Charter would take an equity stake in or pursue an outright buyout of Sprint is unlikely. Sprint's merger talks with T-Mobile have been put on hold, reports the Journal. The new Sprint talks come as Wall Street chatter has speculated that a T-Mobile-Sprint merger could be imminent. Sprint and Charter declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. A Comcast spokesperson declined to comment. ""Many think that Sprint really had its back against the wall and many thought if T-Mobile were to happen, it would essentially be a take-under,"" Fritzsche said on ""Squawk Box. "" The new deal ""might call that into significant question."" Shares of Sprint were up 2 percent in premarket on Tuesday, above $8 a share. Fritzsche said Sprint could offer Charter and Comcast many benefits to the deal as well. ""What Sprint brings to the table is a tremendous spectrum position,"" Fritzsche said.

2016-11-02 00:00:00,2016,11.0,2,Qualcomm reports better-than-expected quarterly revenue,"(Reuters) - Smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm Inc, which agreed to buy NXP Semiconductors NV for about $38 billion last week, reported a better-than-expected 13.3 percent rise in quarterly revenue, helped by strong demand, particularly in China. The company’s shares were marginally higher in after-hours trading on Wednesday. The San Diego-based company, which supplies chips to Android smartphone makers and Apple Inc, reported mobile chip shipments of 211 million for the quarter compared with its own forecast of 195 million-215 million. Analysts on average had expected shipment of 206.1 million in the quarter, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount. “Our chipset business is also benefiting from a strong new product ramp across tiers, particularly with fast growing OEMs in China,” said Qualcomm Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf. Qualcomm gets the bulk of its revenue from chip sales but most of its profit comes from wireless patents it licenses to the mobile industry. The NXP deal - the largest-ever in the semiconductor industry - would make Qualcomm the leading supplier to the fast-growing automotive chips market. Qualcomm said it expects revenue of $5.7 billion-$6.5 billion for the current quarter. Analysts had expected $6.15 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to Qualcomm rose to $1.60 billion, or $1.07 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 25, from $1.06 billion, or 67 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/2f1RLQQ) Revenue rose to $6.18 billion from $5.46 billion. Excluding items, Qualcomm earned $1.28 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.22. Up to Wednesday’s close of $67.09, Qualcomm’s shares had risen 34.2 percent this year, handily outperforming the 22.2 percent gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor index.

2019-07-09 00:00:00,2019,7.0,9,Civil Rights Groups Mostly Unimpressed by New Twitter Policy Against 'Dehumanizing' Language,"Photo:  Mary Turner / GettyCivil rights organizations were, somehow, both pleased and exasperated with Twitter on Tuesday after the social network announced the latest update to its rules against “hateful conduct,” a change characterized by the New York Times, which first broke the news, as a “scaling back” of the company’s policymaking to focus solely on banning speech “insulting and unacceptable if directed at religious groups.”The update itself focuses entirely on “dehumanizing language,” i.e., the comparison of a religious group to “maggots,” “viruses,” “animals,” or “rats,” to cite several examples offered up by the company. It boils down a single sentence added to its hateful conduct policy—“We also prohibit the dehumanization of a group of people based on their religion”—and is a result of months of public feedback, as well as conversations with “experts in the space,” Twitter said. “It’s something that we’ve been thinking about for quite some time and figuring out how we can best create a solution for,” a Twitter spokesperson told Gizmodo by phone. “Whether its some kind of policy remediation or product solution, we wanted to make sure we have the most substantial impact.” “It’s a starting point,” they added, “before we evolve.” https://gizmodo.com/leading-civil-rights-groups-call-facebooks-latest-inter-1835994293Several prominent civil rights groups said they were none too impressed with development. Every comment applauding the update as a “step in the right direction” was accompanied by a “but,” or a “however,” that ultimately cast the policy as either “too little” or “too late” to address a tide of abusive content aimed at threatening or intimidating users because of, for example, their religion, the color of their skin, or their sexual orientation. Muslim Advocates, a topic critic of Twitter’s moderation efforts, said that while the change was a positive one, it may be rendered toothless, depending on how Twitter chooses to enforce its new policy. The group, led by Farhana Khera, a former counsel to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, further raised doubts over how Twitter would choose to define “dehumanization,” saying the precise meaning remained unclear. “It’s offensive that they’re not going head-on after white supremacy, and we think they ought to.”The group pointed, for example, to a tweet by President Trump this April which included footage of Rep. Ilhan Omar, one of the first Muslim women to serve in Congress, interspliced with footage of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The purpose of the tweet quite clearly was to conjure up a spurious and xenophobic stereotype that all Muslims are terrorists. “Would this count as dehumanizing someone based on their religion?” the group asked. Twitter, speaking with Gizmodo on Tuesday, appeared to lean toward a very literal definition of the term—tweets that explicitly “reduce a person to less than human, whether it be animalistic or mechanistic,” it said. With regard to whether a video reducing all Muslims to terrorists falls under the policy shift, the answer is no. While unwilling to comment on the president’s tweet specifically, a spokesperson said that was a “slightly different” situation. “The difference here,” they said, “is the dehumanization aspect.” Twitter’s existing policy on hateful conduct does, in fact, prohibit tweets that assert “all [insert religious group] are terrorists.” But this appears to leave ample room for the use of dog-whistles, coded language and imagery, such as Trump’s video of Rep Omar, that enable users to convey their bigotry with some deniability. Facebook, for instance, has a policy that prohibits praise or support for “white nationalism” and “white separatism.” But in order to violate it, one has to use those terms specifically, a glaring flaw that civil rights groups say makes impotent its entire enforcement process.Asked if, in general, creating and tweeting a video of a prominent Muslim figure interspliced with, say, footage of an ISIS beheading, would violate its rules against “hateful conduct,” Twitter’s spokesperson replied: “A hypothetical is a little hard to comment on when it comes to individuals and their behaviors.” They added, however, that if a “wish of harm or a threat of violence” was included, that such a video would violate its rules “as they stand today.”While the very act of conflating Muslims with terrorism is, to any rational observer, a “wish of harm,” it appears that to violate Twitter’s rules one would need to expressly spell out the threat. The line is difficult to locate. While Trump’s tweet about Rep. Omar remains online, the president himself is exempt from punishment because, according to Twitter, anything he has to say falls under a “public interest” exemption. “Twitter’s update is too simplistic for the complicated world we live in, and fails to address the nuanced intersections of its users’ identities,” said Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, the nation’s largest online racial justice organization. Limiting its update to the “dehumanization” of religious groups, he said, undercuts the company’s efforts to address the abundance of other hateful content directed at users for a variety of reasons, such as the color of their skin.  “Would this count as dehumanizing someone based on their religion?”The coalition Change the Terms, of which Color of Change is a member, has created a definition of “hateful activities” it wishes social networks to adopt that includes not only threats of violence and harassment, but defamation targeting individuals or groups based on their “actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, immigration status, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability.”Jessica Gonzalez, vice president of strategy and senior counsel at Free Press, another coalition member, said the upshot was that Twitter’s update was “good” but ultimately “not nearly enough,” as the company has so far refused to take action against white supremacists in general, even as other prominent social networks have moved in recent months to do so.“People are being taken down who are protesting racism and people are staying up who are wildly racist and organizing racist rallies using social media and using Twitter, in particular,” she said. “Twitter needs to do a wholesale reform of its content moderation policy. We can’t have this happen piecemeal. It’s offensive that they’re not going head-on after white supremacy, and we think they ought to.”When asked whether Twitter is working on plans to ban white supremacist content, and, moreover, why it is not already banned under its current policies, the company declined to comment. “It’s good that Twitter is seeking public comment as they’re developing their policy decisions and seeking input from external experts on hate, but hate and harassment on Twitter is a serious, longstanding problem,” a spokesperson for the Anti-Defamation League, an American Jewish organization that fights bigotry, told Gizmodo.However, the fact that language dehumanizing others on the basis of religion only now violates Twitter’s rules, the group said, “shows how far they have to go to truly combat hate.” ",https://gizmodo.com/civil-rights-groups-mostly-unimpressed-by-new-twitter-p-1836227745,Tech Policy,Gizmodo,technology,1121
2017-04-12 00:00:00,2017,4.0,12,Google Home tips and tricks,"Google Home is one of my favorite gadgets, and spending a bit of time to learn some of its secrets has made it even more valuable to me and my family. Google Home, if you're unfamiliar, is Google's version of the Amazon Echo and works in much the same manner. Speak a command and Google Assistant — the name isn't as appealing as Alexa — answers your query. It's kind of like a magic speaker that just sits on your bedside table, or in your living room, always ready for your beck and call. If you own a Google Home, you can do so much more than ask the weather or how old George Washington was when he died (67). I'll walk you through five of my favorite Google Home tricks now. If you have brownies in the oven for the next 20 minutes but also need to set another timer – maybe for the kid you just placed in time out — you can use Google Home to manage both. Simply say ""Set a timer for 20 minutes,"" for your brownies, then follow with another. ""Set a timer for 10 minutes for time out."" As long as you provide specific names, you'll be able to keep adding on to the original timer. Heading out to a Spanish restaurant and want to make sure you're ready to greet the host properly? ¡No problema! Google Home can help with that. Just ask Google Assistant to translate ""Good evening, how are you?"" to Spanish and you'll get the response right away. You can also query things like: ""'How are you' in Spanish,"" or ""how do I say 'how are you' in Spanish?"" Google Home has a leg up on the Amazon Echo here. You can use it to start movies and TV shows on your Chromecast-enabled TV. Simply say ""Watch Family Guy on Living Room TV,"" for example, and the show will start playing. You'll need to make sure the TV is configured inside the Google Home app, first. Here's a simple guide on how to do that. I tried this and immediately fell in love with the feature, though I admit it's awfully similar to functionality also available on the Amazon Echo. Google Home links up with some of Google's partners, allowing you to order household products like papertowels, soap and more. All you have to say is ""Buy soap"" or ""Buy dog food,"" and the Google Assistant will walk you through available products and prices. Place an order and it'll arrive on your doorstep within the next couple of days. We walked you through how to get a daily briefing on the Amazon Echo, and you can do the same with Google Home. Just say ""Get the news,"" and Google Home will begin playing the latest headlines from CNBC, NPR, ESPN, BBC and more. You can manage news sources inside the Google Home app and easily change the order of which news sources play first.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/12/google-home-tips-and-tricks.html,Tech Guide,CNBC,technology,495
2020-02-21 00:00:00,2020,2.0,21,"ER patients may care less about doctor's race, gender than previously thought","(Reuters Health) - In an online experiment, people gave “simulated” emergency room doctors roughly the same satisfaction rating regardless of the healthcare provider’s gender or color. People’s confidence in the doctor’s abilities did not appear to be affected by the doctor’s race or gender, according to the report published in JAMA Network Open. “We were surprised, but also encouraged to see the results of the study,” said Dr. Basmah Safdar, an associate professor at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. “Going in, I had a bias thinking we would see a difference, based on my own personal experience.” Safdar notes that she has had very negative experiences in which patients seemed to dismiss her either because she is a woman or because her skin tone is dark. She remembers a time when, clad in her doctor’s coat, after spending half an hour with a patient, she was asked, “When is the doctor coming?” “I’ve also had people say things because of my color,” Safdar said. “So, I can relate to those who have had those kinds of experiences. Personally, I would say that those anecdotes are few, but they stick in my mind and influence how I think. Having said that, those are just two incidents out of the thousands of patients I’ve seen over the last 15 years.” To look at the issue in a scientific way, Safdar and colleagues designed a simulation that would be run with the help of two online platforms commonly used in academic research: Amazon Mechanical Turk and Lucid. The researchers recruited 3,200 people from the two platforms who were willing to pretend they were patients who had gone to the emergency room because of a stomach problem. Participants were all given the same scenario: they had gone to the ER for symptoms consistent with gastroenteritis, which can include cramping, diarrhea and vomiting. They were shown a picture of a physician who had been randomly assigned to them - a black man, a black woman, a white man or white woman - and were told the doctor had determined, based on tests, patient history and examination, that the diagnosis was gastroenteritis. Alongside the doctor’s diagnosis was a contradictory diagnosis from an online symptom checker, which suggested participants’ symptoms might indicate a much more serious condition, appendicitis. That second diagnosis was presented to instill doubt in the minds of the “patients.” Afterward, participants were asked if they had confidence in the ability of their assigned physician to correctly diagnose their condition and prescribe the right treatment. They were also asked to rate the care they received in the emergency room. When the researchers analyzed the responses, they did not see signs of gender or racial bias. Out of a possible perfect score of 100 for patient satisfaction and confidence, all the simulated doctors got scores around 66-67. While Safar allows there might be differences between people who sign up for online platforms like Mechanical Turk and those who don’t, overall, she believes the sample of people who participated in the study was nationally representative. Whether people who sign up to do surveys and experiments online are truly representative of people from all over the U.S. is an open question, said Dr. Michelle Ko, an assistant professor in the division of health policy and management in the Department of Public Health Services at the University of California, Davis. Moreover, Ko said, “It’s hard to say how closely this approximates a real-world interaction.” Nevertheless, Ko is somewhat reassured by the findings. “If nothing else, the study tells me that things aren’t terrible,” she said.

2018-08-23 00:00:00,2018,8.0,23,Fitbit teams with U Michigan researchers to combat doctor depression,"What would happen if you took a group of healthy, young people and subjected them to months of sleep deprivation, piles of work, extreme pressure to succeed and hazing from superiors and peers? Oh, and during that time, a single mistake could mean the difference between saving a life or inadvertently killing someone. That's basically what happens for thousands of Americans each during their medical internship. After medical school, which itself is super stressful, graduates spend about two years practicing under supervision at a hospital. Reports have shown that many of them face depression, anxiety and other mental health issues. University of Michigan researchers have been studying the problem for more than a decade, enrolling over 2,000 medical interns from schools around the country every year, then studying how they fare over time. ""During the first year of training, rates of depression [go] up, risk of suicide goes up, anxiety goes up and part of what we're studying is why that is and who's at risk and what environmental elements put them at risk,"" Dr. Srijan Sen, professor of depression and neurosciences, said in an interview with CNBC. The problem seems to start in medical school, where a survey found that roughly 10 percent of students had thought about killing themselves within the previous year. This population also suffers from suicide at rates 15 to 30 percent higher than the general population. It continues, and for some gets a lot worse, during the internship. ""We find that many of the interns start out fine, and about half get depressed by the end of the year,"" said Sen. Now the study is getting a technology boost. The interns are getting a Fitbit. Fitbit got involved with the study through its own research efforts, which involve looking at consumer-generated data for signals of depression. The company thinks its data could be useful in analyzing things like sleep interruptions and varying activity levels, which might contribute to mental health problems. If an intern is running on particularly low levels of sleep and exercise, a Fitbit could pick it up. ""We see indications that sleep can get pretty erratic, especially for medical interns who are shift workers,"" said Jonathan Charlesworth, a research scientist at Fitbit and a trained neuroscientist. ""We're seeing that correlate to depressive symptoms."" The Michigan researchers are also working with a start-up called Mindstrong Health, which is looking at how smartphones can be used to diagnose and treat mental health disorders. An example of that might be the ways that these interns interact with the keyboards on their smartphones. For now, the researchers aren't intervening. Instead, they're trying to figure out what kinds of feedback would be most valuable, such as letting the participants know that they slept less on average in a week than the previous one. That might prompt them to get a little more sleep. ""What we want to do is provide them with tools to help themselves,"" said Sen. The ultimate goal is to use the latest technologies to figure out who's most at risk and design the right kinds of interventions, which don't invade personal privacy. Fitbit could also benefit as it looks to move from consumer wellness to helping people with diagnosed medical conditions, including mental health conditions. Sen is also hoping the medical system will recognize what a big problem it is that so many junior doctors get depressed. And really do something about it. The study is an important step, "" Sen said, but ultimately young doctors need ""more human hours and built-in ways to take care of themselves.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/23/fitbit-teaming-u-michigan-combat-doctor-depression.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,596

The 39-year-old actress is just a few pounds away from hitting her weight loss goal, and celebrated with an Instagram post. “Okay my friends, wanted to share! I’m a couple lbs. from goal weight!” Hudson posted on Wednesday, along with a photo showing off her abs. “I’ve done it without stressing on food or working out like crazy although I have been disciplined.” The mom of three joined WW as one of their ambassadors in December — two months after giving birth to daughter Rani Rose — with the goal of losing 25 lbs. by this spring, when she starts filming a new movie. “I’ve taken my time, I’ve stayed true to my @ww app which I am so grateful for our relationship and that they included me in their family because it’s an incredible set up,” she said, and joked, “Easy as pie! And I can eat pie… except it’s anywhere from 9-22 points which is not the best move… I personally go for the 5-point wine or vodka martini for a treat.” Hudson conceded that she has always liked working out and learning about nutrition, so getting healthy is fairly easy for her, but she said that her Fabletics and WW communities still helped her through the process. “Yes, active lifestyle I find enjoyable and yes, understanding food is a passion of mine but it doesn’t mean that I don’t need the support like everyone else,” she said. “Sharing the little parts of my wellness journey with you makes me feel oh so good. I can only hope that what I put out there can make you feel good and bring encouragement in return.” Hudson added a note at the end: “PS I ain’t done yet!” In December, Hudson said she was excited about the “challenge” of working out again after a tough pregnancy. “I enjoy being disciplined. I enjoy being athletic, and I enjoy being active. So for me it’s actually kind of a fun time to challenge my body again in certain ways,” she told PEOPLE. “After pregnancy, getting your body back into shape for me — especially in fitness — finding my stomach muscles again and pushing myself a little bit harder sometimes are things that I enjoy.” And Hudson loved that she didn’t have to change too much of her usual habits with WW. “I don’t think it’s as much about changing anything, as it is about knowledge of the things that you love,” she said. “That’s the thing that sets it apart to me from everything else. This is about understanding your wellness. It’s about understanding your fitness activity, understanding your food, understanding the things that you love. It’s about how to balance.”",https://people.com/health/kate-hudson-couple-pounds-from-goal-weight/,health,People,health,455

2020-03-16 00:00:00,2020,3.0,16,BioNTech in China alliance with Fosun over potential coronavirus vaccine,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BioNTech struck a collaboration deal with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical over the German biotech firm’s rights in China to an experimental coronavirus vaccine, the latest gambit in a global race to halt the pandemic. Once regulators approve the vaccine, Fosun will market it in China, with BioNTech retaining rights for the rest of the world, the German group said, adding that it was aiming to start testing on humans from late April.BioNTech also said it was in advanced discussions with its existing partner Pfizer over the development of the vaccine outside China. The U.S. pharma giant earlier this month identified BioNTech as a potential partner for the development. Mainz-based BioNTech, founded in 2008 and listed on the Nasdaq exchange in October last year, said it intends to initiate clinical testing for the compound called BNT162 in Europe, the United States and China. The race is on to develop an immunisation, which is seen as by far the most effective tool to halt the global spread of the pathogen. U.S. rival Moderna, which is working with the U.S. National Institutes of Health, is the closest to human testing, announcing plans to start a trial in Seattle this month. BioNTech’s unlisted German rival CureVac aims to be ready by July to request the go-ahead for testing on humans of an experimental vaccine, while Johnson & Johnson has said it is optimistic it can start vaccine testing later this year. Signs of a tussle between national governments over medical gear and rights to therapeutics have already started to emerge. The German government is trying to stop the U.S. administration from persuading CureVac to move its research to the United States. China’s Fosun will pay BioNTech up to $135 million in upfront and potential future investment and milestone payments for development achievement, BioNTech said, adding that the two companies will share future gross profits from the sale of the vaccine in China. Fosun will also take a 0.7% stake from new shares in BioNTech for $50 million. BioNTech said it plans to produce the vaccine for the clinical trials together with contract manufacturer Polymun GmbH at BioNTech’s manufacturing facilities in Europe. BioNTech, CureVac and Moderna have specialised in so-called messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules which instruct human cells to produce proteins that trigger an immune response in the body against cancer or infectious diseases.

2020-01-15 00:00:00,2020,1.0,15,Toyota makes a big bet on secretive flying taxi startup Joby Aviation,"Joby Aviation, a California-based aerospace company that has been working on electric aircraft for over a decade, just closed its latest round of financing with $590 million in venture capital funding — and a major new partner. Toyota will work with Joby to design and build a fleet of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft for use in a ride-hailing service. The Japanese auto giant was part of a previous Joby funding round that closed in 2018, helping the secretive startup raise $100 million. Obviously Toyota liked what it saw, because it stepped up to lead this latest round of fundraising, bringing Joby’s total raise to $720 million. Joby recently announced a deal with Uber to deploy its air taxis on its ride-hailing network — though its unclear whether Toyota’s air taxis will make the cut. Joby is the brainchild of inventor JoeBen Bevirt, who started the company in 2009. The company operated in relative obscurity until 2018, when Joby announced it had raised a surprising $100 million from a variety of investors, including the venture capital arms of Intel, Toyota, and JetBlue. The money helped finance development of the company’s air taxi prototype, which has been conducting test flights at Joby’s private airfield in Northern California. Bevirt helps run an incubator outside of Santa Cruz that’s been described as a quasi-commune. Unlike the dozens of other companies that are currently building electric VTOL aircraft, Joby has kept much of its project under wraps. But as part of the Toyota announcement, Joby decided to share some more details about its aircraft — and some images. The all-electric aircraft has six rotors and seats five, including the pilot. It can take off vertically, like a helicopter, and then shift into forward flight using tilt rotors. Joby says it can reach a top speed of 200 mph, can travel 150 miles on a single charge, and is 100 times quieter than a conventional aircraft. “We are building a new system for transportation to transform your daily life, at greater safety and, in time, at a similar cost to driving,” Bevirt said in a statement. With Toyota as a manufacturing partner, Joby believes it can bring its aircraft to market faster than the rest. “Toyota will share its expertise in manufacturing, quality, and cost controls to support the development and production of Joby Aviation’s aircraft,” the company says. “This support, along with the capital investment, will accelerate the certification and deployment of this new mode of local transportation.” It’s deal-making season for Joby. The company formed a partnership with Uber a few weeks ago. Joby will supply and operate the electric air taxis, and Uber will provide air traffic control help, landing pad construction, connections to ground transportation, and, of course, its ride-share network reconfigured to allow customers to hail flying cars (rather than boring, regular, terrestrial ones). The ride-hailing company also recently showed off a full-scale model of the flying taxi it helped create with Hyundai, and has other manufacturing partners as well. Of course, many companies — Joby included — have promised revolutionary new aircraft for years, only to miss deadlines or fail to live up to past promises. Kitty Hawk, the flying car venture backed by Google co-founder Larry Page, is reorganizing amid reports about breakdowns, battery fires, and returned deposits.

2018-01-31 00:00:00,2018,1.0,31,CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald resigns ," (CNN)Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, resigned Wednesday, a day after Politico reported Fitzgerald's purchase of tobacco stock after she took the position at the nation's top public health agency.  Such an investment is obviously at odds with the mission of the CDC, considering cigarette smoking will result in the deaths of nearly half a million Americans this year. Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. The CDC's slogan is ""24/7: Saving Lives, Protecting People."" But Fitzgerald bet against that mission just one month into her tenure at the agency, when she purchased stock in a tobacco company -- one of the very drugs she is supposed to be leading the crusade against.  The news of her stock purchases was first reported Tuesday. According to that report, Fitzgerald ""bought tens of thousands of dollars in new stock holdings in at least a dozen companies,"" including Japan Tobacco, one of the largest tobacco companies in the world. It sells four brands in the US: Export ""A,"" LD, Wave and Wings. The day after the purchase, Fitzgerald ""toured the CDC's Tobacco Laboratory, which researches how the chemicals in tobacco harm human health,"" according to Politico. In a statement in November, Fitzgerald highlighted CDC data that illustrated the extent of tobacco use among US adults, stating, ""Too many Americans are harmed by cigarette smoking, which is the nation's leading preventable cause of death and disease."" She then vowed to ""continue to use proven strategies to help smokers quit and to prevent children from using any tobacco products."" Concerns about potential conflicts related to Fitzgerald's financial interests were already under the microscope.  Fitzgerald also invested in pharmaceutical companies Merck and Bayer, as well as health insurance company Humana, according to Politico. The CDC referred requests for comment to the Department of Health and Human Services. ""Like all Presidential Personnel, Dr. Fitzgerald's financial holdings were reviewed by the HHS Ethics Office, and she was instructed to divest of certain holdings that may pose a conflict of interest,"" the latter agency said. ""During the divestiture process, her financial account manager purchased some potentially conflicting stock holdings. These additional purchases did not change the scope of Dr. Fitzgerald's recusal obligations, and Dr. Fitzgerald has since also divested of these newly acquired potentially conflicting publicly traded stock holdings."" Last month, Sen. Patty Murray said Fitzgerald's ability to do her job was hindered by ""ongoing conflicts of interest.""  ""On at least three occasions since Director Fitzgerald's appointment in July, CDC has sent Fitzgerald's deputies to testify at Congressional hearings, alongside the heads of other government agencies, that explored the federal response to the opioid crisis,"" said Murray, D-Washington.  ""Dr. Fitzgerald owns certain complex financial interests that have imposed a broad recusal limiting her ability to complete all of her duties as the CDC Director. Due to the nature of these financial interests, Dr. Fitzgerald could not divest from them in a definitive time period,"" a statement from the Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday.  Fitzgerald, an obstetrician/gynecologist from Georgia, was selected for the position in July by Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Tom Price. Price was forced to resign in September amid a scandal involving his use of private planes. Fitzgerald's resignation was accepted Wednesday morning by Secretary Alex Azar, who assumed that role just last week. Dr. Anne Schuchat will serve as acting director until a replacement is confirmed.

While walking in the Sports Illustrated Swim Search fashion show on Sunday night, model Mara Martin strutted down the runway in a sparkly gold bikini while breastfeeding her 5-month-old daughter. In a clip from the show, Martin is seen carrying her daughter — who is wearing blue ear muffs to block out the noise of the music — while spectators cheer. The Michigan native, who also sported a big smile, was one of 16 people chosen to walk in the show at the W South Beach hotel during Miami Swim Week. “I can’t believe I am waking up to headlines with me and my daughter in them for doing something I do every day,” Martin posted on Instagram the following morning. “It is truly so humbling and unreal to say the least. I’m so grateful to be able to share this message and hopefully normalize breastfeeding and also show others that women CAN DO IT ALL!” She adds: “But to be honest, the real reason I can’t believe it is a headline is because it shouldn’t be a headline! My story of being a mother and feeding her while walking is just that. Last night there are far more deserving headlines that our world should see.” Martin refers to several other women who also walked the runway, including 22-year-old paralympic snowboarder Brenna Huckaby, as well as a woman who is joining the military and another who is a cancer survivor. The model also noted how Sports Illustrated let the finalists “be their true selves.” “Because of you, my daughter is going to grow up in a better world, where she will always feel this way!” she wrote. “Lastly, to every single woman that rocked that runway with me.

FAO,"ROME (Reuters) - World food prices edged marginally higher in April from March, with the prices of most cereals and dairy products continuing to rise while sugar fell further, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday. The Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 173.5 points last month against 172.8 March. From a year earlier, food prices on international markets rose 2.7 percent in April, FAO said. FAO predicted wheat output of 746.6 million tonnes for 2018, down 11.3 million tonnes from the near-record 2017 level. FAO said early prospects for global cereal markets in 2018/19 were favorable. “According to FAO’s first forecasts for the 2018/19 marketing season, cereal supplies should be sufficient to meet consumption requirements. While global cereal reserves are forecast to decline, the decrease is likely to mostly concern maize,” it said.

2016-04-22 00:00:00,2016,4.0,22,"Apple launches Apple Pay in Singapore, Samsung quickly follows","The world's two largest smartphone makers muscled into Singapore's already-crowded mobile payment space this week, but experts say it may take a while for them to see much enthusiasm from locals. Apple launched Apple Pay in the city-state on April 19 for American Express card holders, who can use it at selected outlets and through various apps on most Apple smartphones and some iPads. Jennifer Bailey, the vice president of Apple Pay, said credit and debit cards from Singapore banks including DBS, UOB and Standard Chartered would work with Apple Play in the coming months. The service had previously been launched in the U.S., China, UK, Canada and Australia. A day after Apple's announcement, South Korean electronics giant Samsung said Singapore would be the first country in Southeast Asia to receive its mobile payment system, Samsung Pay. The company said the service would launch this quarter, without giving a specific date. Once available, the city-state will join the likes of South Korea, the U.S. and China, where the service is already up and running. In February, Samsung said its mobile payment service had about 5 million registered users, prior to its launch in China in March. Samsung said that a February survey had showed that interest in the service in Singapore was strong. Of the 400 responses the company received, it said 71 percent were positive. Consumers can use Samsung Pay in most retail outlets that accept credit card payment, using the Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6 edge+, Galaxy S7 and S7 edge smartphones, said Samsung. To prepare for the roll out, Samsung said it was providing training for cashiers at partnering retailers and merchants. The company will also allow users to beta-test the service prior to the launch. Samsung has already confirmed its partnership with MasterCard and Visa, with American Express expected to join up later. Samsung will also partner major banks in Singapore, including DBS/POSB, OCBC Bank and Standard Chartered. But even with Singapore's phenomenal mobile penetration rate, analysts believe the uptake of both Apple and Samsung's mobile payment services may be disappointing. Data from the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore showed the city-state had a mobile phone penetration rate of 148.4 percent in 2015. ""I think that consumer adoption of both Apple Pay and Samsung Pay will be slower than expected in Singapore,"" a researcher at Forrester, Zhi Ying Ng, told CNBC. Ng said while the use of contactless card payments was increasing in Singapore, and consumers were becoming more comfortable with the technology, it would take time for them to realize the additional value that digital wallets brought in terms of simplicity, security and experience. International Data Corporation's (IDC) senior market analyst Michael Yeo told CNBC that while mobile payments were ""absolutely huge in Asia"" with the success of Alipay and WeChat wallet offerings in China, in Singapore, the technology had yet to take off. ""There are quite a few systems out there...but there isn't one which has quite yet made big inroads into the payments scene,"" said Yeo. This was largely ""due to the siloed nature and incompatibilities between the various payment methods"" in Singapore, he added. Many banks and payment networks already have mobile payment apps, including MasterCard's MasterPass, Standard Chartered Bank and SingTel's Dash, DBS's PayLah! and OCBC's Pay Anyone. Kiranjeet Kaur, a research manager at IDC, added that Apple had a slight advantage over Samsung because, of the Samsung phones shipped in 2015, only half supported Samsung Pay, while Apple shipped most iPhone 6 models that are Apple Pay-enabled. Both Yeo and Kaur said the limitation Apple Pay faced in Singapore was that it is currently limited to American Express cardholders, but once the service was extended to other banks, Yeo said he expected to see Apple Pay take ""close to 20 percent of payments that are made through NFC terminals in Singapore by the end of the year."" NFC refers to near field communication, the technology that allows two devices, such as a smartphone and a payment terminal, to communicate by putting them near each other. — Follow CNBC International on and Facebook.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/20/singapore-to-be-first-southeast-asian-country-to-receive-samsung-pay.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,682
2019-10-30 00:00:00,2019,10.0,30,Twitter will stop running political ads ahead of 2020 election,"New York  (CNN Business)Twitter (TWTR) will stop accepting political ads, the company's CEO, Jack Dorsey, announced Wednesday.  ""We've made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought,"" Dorsey tweeted.  ""A political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money,"" he added. Twitter's chief financial officer, Ned Segal, tweeted Wednesday that the company made less than $3 million from political ads in the 2018 cycle.  ""This decision was based on principle, not money,"" he said. The announcement comes amid intense scrutiny of Silicon Valley's handling of political ads. Social media companies, particularly Facebook, have been criticized for allowing politicians to run false ads. Dorsey's comments puts him at odds with senior Facebook (FB) executives, including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, who have vigorously defended Facebook's policy of not fact-checking political ads.  Zuckerberg reiterated his stance on political advertising on Wednesday, highlighting how Facebook and Twitter have diverged. Without directly addressing Dorsey's announcement, Zuckerberg opened Facebook's third quarter earnings call by saying ""we need to be careful about adopting more and more rules"" surrounding political speech. ""In a democracy, I don't think it's right for private companies to censor politicians or the news,"" he said. Zuckerberg added that he will ""continue"" to evaluate whether it is beneficial to allow political ads on Facebook, but that so far he has concluded that permitting political advertising is the better choice. Political advertising will account for less than 0.5 percent of next year's revenue, Zuckerberg said on the call, suggesting that despite the media controversy over Facebook's policies, the company benefits little financially from the stance. On Wednesday, Facebook reported quarterly advertising revenues of $17.38 billion, up 28 percent over the same period last year. In a speech in Washington D.C. earlier this month, Zuckerberg said, ""Given the sensitivity around political ads, I've considered whether we should stop allowing them altogether. From a business perspective, the controversy certainly isn't worth the small part of our business they make up. But political ads are an important part of voice — especially for local candidates, up-and-coming challengers, and advocacy groups that may not get much media attention otherwise. Banning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media covers."" Some of Facebook's own employees took issue with that reasoning in a letter sent to Zuckerberg and other company leaders that was reported by The New York Times earlier this week. They wrote, ""high-profile politicians can out-spend new voices and drown out the competition"" on the platform.  Political candidates were quick to jump on the Twitter news.   ""When faced with a choice between ad dollars and the integrity of our democracy, it is encouraging that, for once, revenue did not win out,"" said Bill Russo, a spokesman for Vice President Joe Biden's presidential campaign. Earlier this month, Biden's presidential campaign wrote to Twitter and other social media companies asking them to stop running an ad that falsely accused Biden of corruption over his role in Ukraine policy during the Obama administration.  Brad Parscale, President Trump's campaign manager, called Twitter's move ""a very dumb decision for their stockholders."" ""This is yet another attempt to silence conservatives,"" he said in a statement, ""since Twitter knows President Trump has the most sophisticated online program ever known."" In a lengthy series of tweets about Twitter's decision, Dorsey said that ""while internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions."" ""Internet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse: machine learning-based optimization of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes. All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale."" Dorsey said Twitter will also stop running issue ads, which Twitter characterizes as ads that ""advocate for or against legislative issues of national importance."" In his speech in Washington, Zuckerberg cited issue ads as another reason not to ban poltiical ads, ""Even if we wanted to ban political ads, it's not clear where we'd draw the line. There are many more ads about issues than there are directly about elections. Would we ban all ads about healthcare or immigration or women's empowerment?"" Dorsey said the company would share more details about the policy on November 15th and would stop accepting political ads on November 22nd.

2018-08-24 14:00:00,2018,8.0,24,You Could Be Kicked Offline For Piracy If This Music Industry Lawsuit Succeeds,"The entertainment industry is waging a major legal campaign to turn ISPs into copyright cops authorized to kick broadband users offline—based on what’s often flimsy to nonexistent evidence of wrongdoing.   As it currently stands, if you download a copyrighted file via BitTorrent or another platform, you’re risking a copyright violation warning from your ISP. These warnings are generated by investigators hired by the entertainment industry to track and combat online piracy, often by monitoring BitTorrent swarms.   Unfortunately, the warnings are often based on flimsy evidence, and the presumption that if a downloaded file is traced to your IP address, you’re automatically guilty. Of course that’s not always the case, the most common example being if someone decided to download the latest episode of  Game of Thrones  while sitting in your driveway using your WiFi hotspot.   ISPs are required to pass these copyright infringement notices on to end users under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). But since users frequently ignore these warnings, and there’s no real penalty for repeat offenses, the entertainment industry has spent years trying to dramatically up the ante, often to a ridiculous degree.  For example, the music industry has attempted to turn copyright infringement into a revenue model by hiring companies tasked with scaring potential pirates into paying up to avoid a trial. Industry organizations like Rightscorp send “pre-settlement” letters to pirates informing them they can avoid any prolonged, nasty legal headaches simply by paying a fine.   But the practice is legally sketchy, and as this Reddit thread illustrates, paying up is often a bottomless rabbit hole of ever-steeper penalties. Rightscorp, routinely accused of being a “copyright troll,” has subsequently been forced to ease off the practice in recent years in the wake of terrible publicity.  But using Rightscorp as an intermediary, the entertainment industry has also taken to suing ISPs it claims aren’t doing enough to thwart piracy.   The entertainment industry has long misrepresented an integral part of the DMCA to mean that ISPs should be forced to kick pirates offline permanently. Supreme Court precedent ( Packingham v North Carolina ) has been interpreted by copyright experts to indicate that booting users offline for piracy is a violation of the First Amendment.  But the entertainment industry has taken sustained legal action against smaller ISPs that disagree.   One of the industry’s targets has been a small Texas ISP called Grande Communications. Grande was sued in 2017 by a collection of 18 different music and film labels for failing to stop subscribers from engaging ""in more than one million infringements of copyrighted works over BitTorrent systems.""  In its latest filing in the ongoing case, the ISP pulled no punches calling the entertainment industry’s lawsuit against it an “absurd” gambit to force ISPs into the role of “de facto copyright enforcement agents.” Often, the ISP warned, using nonexistent or incomplete evidence as the basis of “misleading” infringement warnings and threats.  ""Having given up on actually pursuing direct infringers due to bad publicity, and having decided not to target the software and websites that make online file-sharing possible, the recording industry has shifted its focus to fashioning new forms of copyright liability that would require ISPs to act as the copyright police,” the ISP wrote in its lawsuit.   The lawsuit comes on the heels of a recent music industry legal victory against Cox Communications. It’s a victory that copyright experts say was based on a notable misrepresentation of the law by the courts, and could pave the way toward the erosion of ISP “safe harbor” protections under the DMCA protecting them from liability.   That could be a huge problem for ISPs and users alike, Meredith Rose, Policy Counsel at consumer group Public Knowledge told me in an email.    “If ISPs lost their safe harbor protections, the incentive would be for ISPs to boot customers proactively, before they ran into any liability,” Rose said. “Proactive enforcement would necessitate pervasive monitoring of user behavior online, which, again, would chill speech—to put it mildly.”   Critics charge that kicking and keeping users offline for alleged copyright infringement isn’t just a draconian over reach and a potential First Amendment violation, it’s a technical nightmare. Tracking booted users and preventing them from simply signing up with other ISPs—under say a spouse's name—would be largely impossible.   But the daunting technical logistics, the resulting legal mess, and the potential stifling of online speech doesn’t seem to worry the music industry, which has argued that a good faith accusation of piracy is enough to warrant kicking a user offline permanently.   “If they won that argument, it creates a perfect storm for consumer extortion, without a much in the way of legal safeguards,” Rose said.    Mitch Stoltz, Senior Staff Attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, agreed. Stoltz told me in a email that the erosion of ISP safe harbor protections “would mean a huge expansion of surveillance over our online lives.”   “It also means that people could be kicked off of their home Internet service because of the actions of roommates, houseguests, children, or strangers,” he said. “In today's world, that means losing access to schoolwork, medical services, political participation, and other vital information—especially because many Americans have only one option for home broadband service.”  For its part, Grande Communications’ latest filing states that the music industry’s lawsuit places it in an “impossible position: either terminate subscribers based on unverified allegations of infringement, or face litigation for the secondary infringement of thousands of copyrighted works.""  So far, the music industry has yet to challenge bigger players with deeper pockets like AT&T, Comcast or Verizon, though these giants are likely watching the case with great interest for liability reasons. Consumers eager to avoid being kicked offline based on nebulous allegations of guilt should probably keep a close eye on the ongoing case.

2019-01-10 00:00:00,2019,1.0,10,Bernie Sanders introduces bills to slash high prescription drug costs,"Vowing to bring an end to ""greed"" in the pharmaceutical industry, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Democratic House leaders said they plan to introduce three new bills Thursday aimed at slashing high prescription drug prices in the U.S. Democrats, who regained control of the House this month, listed lowering prescription drug costs as one of their top priorities. The bills, led by Sanders and Reps. Elijah Cummings of Maryland and Ro Khanna of California, would permit Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to negotiate lower prices for drugs under Medicare Part D, the federal program for prescription drug benefits. The measures would also allow Americans to import lower priced drugs from abroad and peg the price of prescription drugs in the U.S. to the median price in five major countries — Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan. ""If the pharmaceutical industry will not end its greed, which is literally killing Americans, then we will end it for them."" Sanders said in a statement. ""The United States pays by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. This has created a health care crisis in which 1 in 5 American adults cannot afford to get the medicine they need."" According to the latest data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, spending on prescription drugs in the U.S. increased 0.4 percent in 2017 to $333.4 billion, and lawmakers are pinning the blame on the pharmaceutical industry, which sells drugs at significantly higher prices in the U.S. than abroad. However, pharmaceutical companies have argued price increases have been modest. And drugmakers like Pfizer have said the nation's rebate system is responsible for driving the price of medicines artificially higher. Those are the discounts drugmakers give to middlemen such as pharmacy benefit managers, often in exchange for more favorable insurance coverage for their drugs. Some drugmakers last year delayed price hikes on select drugs. But drugmakers raised prices on more than 250 prescription drugs on Jan. 1, according to RX Savings Solutions. Most lawmakers across the aisle agree drug prices here are too high, but Democrats and Republicans have differed on their approach. President Donald Trump, who vowed to lower U.S. drug costs, met with HHS Secretary Azar at the White House this week to discuss the issue. The Trump administration currently has several proposals that would offer lower out-of-pocket costs for American consumers, which include changes to Medicare Part D and Part B. Medicare is the government insurer for the elderly and disabled. Azar on Wednesday praised Merck, Gilead, and Amgen for efforts to lower prices. —CNBC's Meg Tirrell contributed to this report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/10/bernie-sanders-to-introduce-bills-aimed-at-prescription-drug-costs.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,437

In a video on the couple’s shared YouTube channel, East, 28, explained the details of his medical emergency while Johnson East, 27, cradled their one-month-old daughter Drew Hazel. “With the newborn, Shawn and I have been getting less sleep than we usually do,” East explained. “With the less sleep we have been drinking more caffeine. Shawn now, not being pregnant anymore, is getting back into wine. Which means I am getting back into wine. Which means we’re more dehydrated than we usually are.” “More stressed out. Trying to balance work and everything,” added Johnson East. The football player explained that he had a workout planned with two friends at 6 a.m. Before they came over, he headed down to their in-house gym to begin the workout by lifting a 185 lb. bar. “The first movement that I did, which again was not great, after I rolled out of bed was deadlift and clean this 185 lb. bar. I get lightheaded when I stand up or drink too much caffeine,” he explained. East explained on his Instagram post, “As soon as I put the bar on the rack, I went from being fully conscious to nothing. That began this one hour-long period where I don’t remember anything.” The athlete, who noted that something like this had never happened during his time in the NFL, said that he was unconscious on the ground for several minutes before his friends arrived and found him. “As soon as they roll in they see this puddle of blood,” he recalled. “They’re trying to figure out what happened. Trying to figure out if I need to go to the hospital. The decision was made that I do need to go to the ER. Again, I have no idea what is happening. Don’t know who I am, where I am.” Johnson East explained that she had been asleep when her husband was unconscious. After receiving a call that he was taken the hospital, she called her parents to watch their daughter and headed down to the gym to retrieve the footage of her husband fainting, which she sent over to his doctor. The YouTube video then highlighted footage from the hospital, which showed East with blood on his head in a hospital bed as Johnson East remained by his side. “Are you mad at me?” East humorously asked his wife several times, to which she finally responded, “You need to stop asking that question.” East explained to the camera that he got nine staples in his head. “Five of the nine felt fantastic. Didn’t feel at all. Four of the staples sucked. Felt every inch of that,” he said. The couple recalled that they grew even more concerned after a doctor asked East to stay overnight due to an irregularity from his EKG. “You do have an irregular unnatural heart beat. It just so happens that Andrew’s ticks differently,” Johnson East explained to the camera. “I was just terrified,” East admitted. But after staying overnight, the doctors said there were no issues with his heart and he was cleared to go home. “As soon as I heard Shawn cry and watch the video of me being full present and then gone like that, I realized we have a daughter now who depends on us for her life,” East said. “I have a wife who, you’d be fine without me, but you have a kid to take care of as well.” “I don’t want to take anything for granted,” he added. “Every second I have with my child is precious, and every second with my wife is precious. Every second worth living is a second to be grateful for.”",https://people.com/health/shawn-johnson-husband-hospitalized-faints-during-workout/,health,People,health,630

Is there any way to get to it faster in Windows 10 besides running a search for it? A. The Control Panel of previous Windows versions has been largely supplanted by the newer Settings app that Microsoft includes on the lower part of the Start Menu in Windows 10. The Settings app can adjust many of the same Windows elements as the Control Panel, like the display, devices and network connections. But if you miss the old familiar Control Panel (with more direct access to things like Default Programs, AutoPlay and the Device Manager), you can get to it more quickly than by typing or commanding the Cortana assistant from the Search box. While there are many ways to cut down the time to the Control Panel, one quick route is to right-click on the Start Menu button and choose the Control Panel option from the menu that pops up. Pressing the Windows and X keys also opens the menu with the Control Panel item, with shortcuts to other Windows utilities like the Device Manager, Task Manager, Power Options, Command Prompt and File Explorer. If you like the visual Start Menu of Windows 10, you can also add the Control Panel to your collection of tiles. Just enter “Control Panel” into the Search box or tell Cortana to “open Control Panel.” Right-click the Control Panel result in the list and choose “Pin to Start.” Once you have the tile pinned to the Start Menu, you can drag it into position at the top of the stack or wherever you find it easiest to use.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/technology/personaltech/taking-control-of-the-windows-10-control-panel.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,283

Apparently, Zuckerberg himself was one of the many Facebook profiles collected through the app. The revelation came as part of a string of yes-or-no questions from Rep. Anna Eschoo (D-CA), who encouraged Facebook to adopt a more serious approach to data privacy. “Was your data included in the data sold to malicious third parties?” Eshoo asked. “Your personal data?” “Yes,” Zuckerberg answered. It's unclear if Zuckerberg installed the ""thisisyourdigitallife” app himself or if his data was collected through one of his friends. Still, the result is a newly personal connection to the scandal that has raised grave new concerns about the Facebook platform. Facebook began sending notifications to users this week if their profiles were included in the leak.

2016-07-13 00:00:00,2016,7.0,13,Chinese man to serve U.S. prison term for military hacking,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A Chinese businessman who pleaded guilty in March to conspiring to hack into the computer networks of Boeing (BA.N) and other major U.S. defense contractors was sentenced on Wednesday to nearly four years in prison, prosecutors said. Su Bin, 51, was charged with taking part in a years-long scheme by Chinese military officers to obtain sensitive military information. In addition to the 46-month prison term, a judge in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles ordered Su to pay a $10,000 fine. “Su Bin’s sentence is a just punishment for his admitted role in a conspiracy with hackers from the People’s Liberation Army Air Force to illegally access and steal sensitive U.S. military information,” John Carlin, assistant attorney general for national security, said in a statement. “Su assisted the Chinese military hackers in their efforts to illegally access and steal designs for cutting-edge military aircraft that are indispensable to our national defense,” the statement said. In an August 2014 indictment, prosecutors said Su traveled to the United States at least 10 times between 2008 and 2014 and worked with two unidentified co-conspirators based in China to steal the data. The trio were accused of stealing plans relating to the C-17 military transport plane and F-22 and F-35 fighter jets, and attempting to sell them to Chinese companies. According to prosecutors, in pleading guilty Su admitted sending emails to his co-conspirators telling them which persons, companies and technologies to target with their hacking and translating the stolen material from English to Chinese. Su admitted taking part in the crime for financial gain, prosecutors said. The Chinese government has repeatedly denied any involvement in hacking. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang repeated that the Chinese government opposes and punishes any form of hacking. “The so-called case of Chinese soldiers being involved in stealing secrets from the United States is acting on hearsay and has ulterior motives,” Lu told reporters, without elaborating. Su was arrested in Canada in 2014 and ultimately consented to U.S. extradition. He pleaded guilty in March to one count of conspiring to gain unauthorized access to a protected computer and to violate the Arms Export Control Act.

2017-03-24 00:00:00,2017,3.0,24,"Trump shrugs, says 'we'll have to see' when asked about health-bill vote","Facing a potentially embarrassing defeat of his effort to repeal and replace major parts of Obamacare, President Donald Trump shrugged Friday when asked what would he would do next if the embattled bill fails in Congress. After shrugging, Trump said: ""We'll have to see."" ""See what happens,"" the president told reporters at the White House, a day after demanding a Friday vote by the House and declaring that he would negotiate no more concessions on the plan. The chances of losing the vote seemed to increase right after Trump spoke when the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, revealed he will vote against the plan. Trump also said ""No,"" when asked if he had rushed the bill. But he said ""yes,"" when asked if Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., should remain as speaker of the House if the bill goes down in flames. The bill, dubbed the American Health Care Act, has been promoted by Ryan, Trump and other Republican leaders as a tool to undo key sections of the Affordable Care Act, and replace them with new legislation. Despite the fact that it is a bill pushed by Republicans who control the White House and both chambers of Congress, the plan's biggest threat to passage comes not from Democrats, but from 30 to 40 GOP members of the House who could vote against it. Some conservatives in the House oppose the bill, or are leaning against it, because it does not go far enough to repeal Obamacare. Moderates have qualms that the bill could lead to steep decreases in the number of Americans with health insurance coverage. Trump and GOP leaders have offered a series of amendments to assuage concerns of members of Congress. But in doing so, they have may have made it even more difficult to cobble together enough votes to pass it. Republican leaders postponed the House's scheduled vote for Thursday after it became clear the bill would fail. Leaders then offered an amendment that would allow states to determine what kind of so-called essential health benefits would be included in health plans, as opposed to the federal government mandating what benefits have to be included. That change was part of the reason that Frelinghuysen declared himself as a ""no"" vote on Friday. ""Unfortunately, the legislation before the House today is currently unacceptable as it would place significant new costs and barriers to care on my constituents in New Jersey,"" Frelinghuysen said in a Facebook post. ""In addition to the loss of Medicaid coverage for so many people in my Medicaid-dependent state, the denial of essential health benefits in the individual market raise serious coverage and cost issues."" ""I remain hopeful that the American Health Care Act will be further modified. We need to get this right for all Americans,"" he said. —Additional reporting by CNBC's Jacob Pramuk",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/24/trump-shrugs-says-well-have-to-see-when-asked-about-health-bill-vote.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,478
2017-11-28 00:00:00,2017,11.0,28,A doctor who won't use a computer loses her license to practice medicine," (CNN)Anna Konopka, a doctor in New London, New Hampshire, refuses to practice what she calls ""electronic medicine."" She doesn't know how to use a computer, and she handwrites her patient records and keeps them in file cabinets. Why? ""Because electronic medicine is for the system, not for the patients,"" said the 84-year-old, who is originally from Poland. ""The system is destroying human relations between the doctor and the patient."" Konopka's refusal to keep electronic records, though, has played a part in a judge denying her request to regain her license to practice, which she voluntarily surrendered in October after allegations of misconduct were brought against her, according to the judge's ruling. In his ruling on November 15, Merrimack County Superior Court Judge John Kissinger dismissed a case brought by Konopka to regain her license. Konopka said she was pressured into surrendering her license and was told that if she didn't, she would have it taken away.  The allegations against Konopka started in October 2014 when a complaint brought to the New Hampshire Board of Medicine accused her of ""improper prescribing practices"" regarding a child patient, according to the state. After an investigation into the allegation, the board reprimanded Konopka in May.  After Konopka agreed to the reprimand, the board's medical review subcommittee received additional complaints regarding her, according to Kissinger's ruling. He said in the ruling that the allegations surround her record keeping, prescribing practices and medical decision making.  Konopka, who denies misconduct, signed a voluntary surrender of license in September, in which she agreed to give up her license effective October 13, allowing her time to ""provide scheduled and emergency treatment,"" according to the surrender.  In early October, Konopka requested an injunction from the court in hopes of continuing her practice, saying she surrendered her license under duress. Kissinger said in his ruling that Konopka failed to show she was pressured into surrendering the license. ""Her motivation to seek an injunction allowing her to continue to practice comes from a sincere desire to continue to help her patients,"" he wrote. ""Under these circumstances of this case, however, Dr. Konopka has failed to demonstrate that the extraordinary remedy of an injunction allowing her to continue to practice medicine is appropriate. To hold otherwise would be to ignore the process established by the Legislature to regulate the practice of medicine in this state."" Not giving up the fight Konopka filed a motion on November 22 asking Kissinger to reconsider and has filed affidavits from 30 of her patients speaking on her behalf. ""I cannot get too upset,"" she said regarding the ruling. ""I'm not devastated with that. I think that people are doing certain things against me. They are part of the political system, you know. I'm coping with the system. ""If you are not with system, the system considers you enemy of system, because you are out of the system. Therefore, as enemy of the system, you have to be destroyed."" Unless Kissinger reverses his decision, Konopka won't be able to see the 20 to 25 patients per week who used to come to her practice, where she works alone and charges patients $50. She said her low fees make it hard for her to afford a lawyer. She was represented by legal counsel at the time she signed the surrender, and Barbara McKelvy, one of Konopka's patients, said she is working to find a pro bono lawyer for Konopka. Konopka said patients prefer her practice compared to big hospitals because of the individual attention they receive. Doctors at hospitals look at computers all the time, Konopka said, and rely on them, instead of their intellect, for diagnoses and guidelines to prescribing medications. She called that system expensive and harmful to patients. The doctors have no contact with the patients, she said. ""They practice electronic medicine, I practice medical art,"" she said. ""I treat the patient. And I'm not going to compromise the patient's health or life for the system."" Jill Beaudry, one of Konopka's patients who wrote to the court, told CNN Konopka is caring and passionate about her patients and doesn't care about the money. She added that Konopka is one of the best doctors she's been to.  ""My old doctors, they had their heads shoved into their computers. It was never personal with you. They never even looked at you,"" Beaudry said. ""With her, she's 100% focused, and I hate when the doctors are using computers like that, because that's not medicine."" As Konopka waits to hear from Kissinger, she said she plans to use a computer for minimal tasks such as staying up-to-date on whether she regains her license to practice. She won't, however, give in to practicing ""electronic medicine."" ",https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/28/health/new-hampshire-doctor-license-injunction-request-denied-trnd/index.html,health,CNN,health,784

It also isn't planning any layoffs, according to a spokesperson. There is some speculation, however, that Amazon may change its plans and use new technology inside of Whole Foods locations. Amazon Go, for example, is a new service that Amazon has been testing in its own small grocery store in Seattle that allows shoppers — only Amazon employees — to walk in, pick up goods and walk out without ever going through a check-out line. Amazon Go doesn't use robots to stock shelves (yet) but Amazon does tap into computer vision and deep learning to power its shopping experience. That process eliminates the need for a cashier or a full grocery staff almost entirely and makes the shopping experience smoother for consumers who don't need to wait in line. It's hard to see why Amazon wouldn't do this eventually, but Whole Foods employees can rest safe for now. Amazon was not immediately available for comment.

2018-06-11 16:08:00,2018,6.0,11,The US Has the Most Powerful Supercomputer In the World Again," On Friday, Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee unveiled Summit, a supercomputer capable of 200 petaflops, or 200,000 trillion calculations per second. Summit is over two times more powerful than the previous world-record holder, China’s Sunway TaihuLight, which means the US is home to the most powerful supercomputer in the world again after being dethroned eight years ago. The new supercomputer has been in development at IBM since 2014 and is eight times more powerful than Titan, which until last week was the leading supercomputer in the United States. To put the power of Summit in perspective, if every person on Earth—that’s all 7.6 billion of us—did one calculation per second, it would take 305 days to do what Summit can do in a second. Although Oak Ridge National Laboratory has been a leader in developing new supercomputing systems for decades—it was the first in the world to perform teraflop (a trillion operations per second) and petaflop calculations, and is gunning to be the first to reach an exaflop (a quintillion operations per second)—most of the leading supercomputers in the world reside in China. Yet as supercomputers become more important for cutting-edge scientific research and developing artificial intelligence capabilities, the US is investing more heavily in its supercomputing infrastructure. Today, supercomputers at US national laboratories are used for everything from simulating the conditions around detonated nuclear bombs to modeling the Earth’s climate. Creating these types of models is complex because of the huge number of interacting elements involved. Supercomputers can handle this complexity by leveraging parallel processing architectures, in which thousands of CPUs and GPUs are coordinated to run similar processes at the same time. Coordinating all this computing hardware makes the machines themselves physically huge and mind-bogglingly complex. Summit uses 9,216 IBM CPUs and 27,648 Nvidia Tesla GPUs. It requires 185 miles of fiber optic cable, takes up the space of two tennis courts, and pumps 4,000 gallons of water through its cooling system every minute. Summit is already being used to analyze the data from the Million Veteran Program, which aims to collect medical information from a million veterans to aid in the development of precision medicine. The Oak Ridge National Lab is also accepting proposals for research projects that could benefit from Summit’s unrivaled computing power. Later this month, computer scientists from the Top 500 list who rank the world’s supercomputers will swing by the lab to do some tests at which point Summit will officially be named the fastest supercomputer in the world.

2016-09-30 00:00:00,2016,9.0,30,Thailand confirms first Zika-linked microcephaly in Southeast Asia,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand reported on Friday the first confirmed cases in Southeast Asia of microcephaly linked to mosquito-borne Zika, as the World Health Organization urged action against the virus across the region. The confirmation of two case of microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size, came a day after U.S. health officials recommended that pregnant women postpone non-essential travel to 11 Southeast Asian countries because of the risk of Zika. “We have found two cases of small heads linked to Zika, the first cases in Thailand,” Prasert Thongcharoen, an adviser to the Department of Disease Control, told reporters in Bangkok. He declined to say where in Thailand the cases were found but officials have said they were not in Bangkok. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said the cases were the first of Zika-linked microcephaly in Southeast Asia and the virus infection represented a serious threat to pregnant women and their unborn children. “Countries across the region must continue to strengthen measures aimed at preventing, detecting and responding to Zika virus transmission,” Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, the WHO’s regional director, said in a statement. U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, which can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last year in Brazil, which has confirmed more than 1,800 cases of microcephaly that it considers to be related to Zika infections in the mothers. Zika has spread extensively in Latin American and the Caribbean over the past year or so, and more recently it has been cropping up in Southeast Asia. Thailand has confirmed 349 Zika cases since January, including 33 pregnant women, and Singapore has recorded 393 Zika cases, including 16 pregnant women. Some health experts have accused Thai officials of playing down the risk of Zika to protect its thriving tourist industry, but Prasert dismissed that. “Thailand is not hiding anything and is ready to disclose everything,” he said, adding that other countries in Southeast Asia might also have cases of Zika-linked microcephaly that they have not disclosed. The WHO said Thailand’s response was an example for the region. “Thailand’s diligence underscores the commitment of health authorities to the health and wellbeing of the Thai public, and provides a positive example to be emulated,” Singh said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Thursday people should consider postponing travel to Brunei, Myanmar, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste (East Timor), and Vietnam. The CDC has already issued a “travel notice” for Singapore, and said such a warning would be considered for the new countries if the number of cases rose to the level of an outbreak. Thailand’s confirmation of Zika-linked microcephaly comes ahead of China’s week-long “Golden Week” holiday with Thailand expecting 220,000 Chinese visitors, up from 168,000 for the week in 2015, Tourism Authority of Thailand governor Yuthasak Supasorn told Reuters. There is no vaccine or treatment for Zika. An estimated 80 percent of people infected have no symptoms, making it difficult for pregnant women to know whether they have been infected. There are also no specific tests to determine if a baby will be born with microcephaly, but ultrasound scans in the third trimester of pregnancy can identify the problem, according to the WHO. Zika is commonly transmitted through mosquitoes but can also be transmitted sexually. Another Thai health ministry adviser urged everyone to work to stop the spread of mosquitoes but said people should not panic. “Don’t have sex with a Zika-infected person. If you don’t know if they are infected, then use a condom,” the adviser, Pornthep Siriwanarangsan, told reporters. “We can’t stop women from becoming pregnant ... but we mustn’t panic.” Health authorities in the region said they were stepping up monitoring, but there has been little testing and officials said the real number of cases was bound to be higher than the confirmed figure. “We do not test everybody, we test only those who are symptomatic,” said Paulyn Jean Rosell-Ubia, health secretary in the Philippines, which has reported 12 Zika cases. “Yes, we are positive that the number is higher because we are not testing everyone.” Malaysia, which has reported six cases of Zika, including two in pregnant women, said it would seek information from Thailand on the particular strain of the Zika virus there. “We are taking serious notice of the reports in Thailand, and we will reach out to the Thai authorities for more information ... so that we can be more prepared,” Malaysia’s health minister, Subramaniam Sathasivam, told Reuters. Authorities in Vietnam, which has reported three cases of Zika, ordered stepped up monitoring of pregnant women. In Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, head of disease outbreak and surveillance Dwi Oktavia said there had been no sign of any increase in birth defects there. Indonesia had one Zika case in 2015 but has confirmed none since then. Microcephaly in babies can lead to respiratory problems related to malformation of the brain, a serious threat to the lives of babies. Children with microcephaly face lifelong difficulties, including intellectual impairment. Zika was first identified in Uganda in 1947 and first isolated in Asia in the 1960s. It was unknown in the Americas until 2014.

2017-12-04 14:00:00,2017,12.0,4,Climate Change Destroyed My Home,"Just over a year ago, Tropical Cyclone Winston, the worst ever cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere, made landfall in Fiji, affecting around 350,400 people (40 percent of the country’s population). The storm caused 44 deaths and damaged an estimated $1.38 billion of our infrastructure, temporarily crippling our economy. I was away in New Zealand, attending university and monitoring the news when my own family’s homes were destroyed. I heard of how my three-year-old daughter clung to her grandma and mother while I tried to get on the next flight home, praying to see them all alive. I tried to call but the telecommunication system was down, and the emergency lines at the evacuation centers were always busy. Our island had never seen this level of destruction. I was born in Fiji, an island country that is rapidly seeing the impacts of climate change. In this region of the world, the science and data about rising sea levels and global warming manifest in front of our eyes. People are leaving their homes, the government is evacuating entire villages to higher land, and everything from our food supply to island culture is threatened. But I first came to accept the severity climate change when visiting the nearby islands of Kiribati and Tuvalu in 2014. One morning, I woke up in panic to hotel staff screaming for all guest to vacate the hotel. Getting off the bed, I had water at knee-height with my belongings floating inside the room. I pushed the door open to find locals waiting to escort guests to an evacuation center. I saw how mothers were carrying their little babies, braving the cold and strength of the waves as the tides rose. These experiences changed the trajectory of my life. I went to graduate school to study how to build stronger communities in the Pacific region in the face of climate change. Now, I lead a project funded by the European Union called Valuing Voices, where we share stories and initiate climate action, including planting mangroves, building seawalls, campaigning for a plastic-free country, and protesting against government actions around energy and fossil fuels. My Pacific people have experienced so much, yet they have become so resilient. These small atolls have experienced this for months—they sometimes see several king tides a day alongside the multiple other natural disasters that make landfall throughout the year. For many, however, all of this is still not enough to believe that climate change exists. Research suggests that emotionally derived knowledge is more effective than rational knowledge in influencing behaviour of others to take actions into their own hands. But with my own country at risk, I continue to fight. In Germany, at this year’s COP, a United Nations climate change conference, I was part of the youth delegation and screened videos of the Pacific and the effects of climate change in our Pacific region.

2019-05-23 00:00:00,2019,5.0,23,'Smart' hearing aids would identify speakers in crowded room,"(Reuters Health) - People wearing hearing aids often struggle to differentiate between speakers in a crowded environment, but a small experiment suggests that brain-controlled assistive hearing devices would be able to detect which voice the user is paying attention to, and enhance it. To do this, the devices would need to separate individual voices in the room, then decode a user’s brainwaves to identify the one the user is giving the most attention, the study authors write in the journal Science Advances. “It comes down to the problem of hearing speech among the noise, which is also a problem for people who have normal hearing. It can be tiring and exhausting to focus,” said senior author Nima Mesgarani, a researcher at Columbia University in New York City. Hearing aids typically amplify all sounds. In a noisy environment, the challenge is separating the different sound sources and identifying the speaker who should be amplified, Mesgarani said. Although some devices have found ways to suppress background noises, they can’t yet effectively separate specific speakers during a conversation. “When you’re focusing on one person who’s speaking, your brain filters out the other sources and only ‘sees’ that,” he told Reuters Health in a phone interview. “If it’s possible to use brainwaves for translational applications, it could change everything.” Mesgarani and colleagues write about the possibilities and challenges around this process, called auditory attention decoding. Importantly, smart hearing aids would need to be able to decode quickly in a nonintrusive way, even if speakers are seated close together. Some research has focused on techniques that require the user to already be familiar with a known speaker, such as a family member or close friend, the authors note. The study team proposes a new algorithm that could separate unfamiliar speakers in a multi-talker situation and then compare the spectrogram, or audio pattern, of every speaker with a “reconstructed” spectrogram of the voice to which the listener’s brain is giving the most attention. Researchers tested the algorithm with three epilepsy patients who were already planning to undergo surgery to implant brain electrodes for measuring neural activity related to their condition. All three volunteers had normal hearing. During the tests, the volunteers listened to both single-talker and multi-talker sound samples that included four stories lasting about three minutes each. During the multi-talker experiment, they were instructed to focus on one speaker and ignore the other. The authors found that the matches between a spectrogram of the voice telling the story and the reconstructed pattern from the user’s brain responses were not perfect, but they say the differences shouldn’t affect the decoding accuracy. In addition to helping hearing-impaired users, the technology might one day be useful to anyone trying to pick out and amplify a single speaker in a noisy environment, they note. “The challenge now is being able to record these brainwaves without invasive devices, but researchers are exploring ways to put electrodes on the head, around the ear or even inside the ear,” Mesgarani said. Still, wearable devices tend to have limited computational powers, the study team writes. New hardware has been developed to implement deep neural network models and may provide enough information to decode a listener’s focus, but this often happens at lower speeds than preferred. “As the technology develops, this could go beyond hearing aids and improve the performance of voice-controlled devices such as Siri or Alexa,” said Sina Miran of the University of Maryland at College Park, who wasn’t involved in the study. “Challenges still exist, but thanks to recent advances in machine learning, I think we’ll see smart hearing aids in the next five years,” he said in a phone interview. “Just like we’re seeing devices that can monitor sleep, stay tuned for exciting news about hearing.” SOURCE: bit.ly/30HnYVa Science Advances, online May 15, 2019.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-hearing-algorithm/smart-hearing-aids-would-identify-speakers-in-crowded-room-idUSKCN1ST2IZ,Health News,Reuters,health,634
2017-09-20 04:01:00,2017,9.0,20,Being a Male Duck Is One Big Dick Measuring Contest,"There are only a few species of birds that have penises. Ducks, which are among them, have earned a reputation for having some of the most bizarre genitalia of all—corkscrew-shaped penises and complex vaginas with dead ends and false passages. Some duck penises are relatively massive. A group from Alaska recorded a ruddy duck with a 42 cm long penis, much longer than the bird itself, duck penis expert Patricia Brennan recently told me over the phone. Brennan is lead author on a new study from The Auk: Ornithological Advances looking at whether a duck's social environment impacts the growth and ultimate size of its penis. The study found that social environment does play a part in how long these birds' penises grow, suggesting that some can grow larger dicks to compete with other males. Brennan, a visiting lecturer of biological sciences at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, found in earlier research that male and female duck genitalia have coevolved. You see, female ducks have these very complex vaginas in response to the male ducks forcing themselves on them. In what's been called a sexual arms race, male ducks have developed long, spiral-shaped penises to get around the challenges of tricky duck vaginas. Duck genitals are kept inside-out in a sack inside their bodies. The male duck thrusts it outwards whenever he feels the moment is right. Brennan caught the action on video during earlier research. (It's a must watch.) Video: Science News/Vimeo ""This co-evolution is actually the result of an arms race over the control of reproduction, because male ducks force females to copulate and females don't like it at all,"" Brennan said. ""So [the females] have evolved this anatomy that allows them to prevent males, essentially, from being successful during these forced inseminations."" Brennan's new paper focuses on what conditions drive penis size. She looked at the ruddy duck, which is known to be very promiscuous, and the lesser scaup, which has a smaller penis and forms seasonal pair bonds. She observed both groups over two years. Brennan hypothesized that a larger penis might evolve in response to female ducks' preference. ""Maybe the females love big penises because they indicate something about the males,"" she said. ""But I already sort of knew that that wasn't going to be likely, because of these forced copulations."" The other option, she thought, is that longer penises give males an edge when they're competing against other males for the same mating partner. In that case, it would be more about males showboating and showing off. ""A male [with] a longer penis can deposit sperm a little farther inside the female,"" she said. Brennan separated both species of duck into several different groups. Lesser scaup male ducks in a group with fewer females grew longer penises (on average) than males who evenly paired with the females. ""Sperm competition and male-male competition do favour a longer penis,"" she said. Ruddy ducks are very horny ducks with extremely long penises to start off with. Brennan thought that even if she put these males in competition with other males, they wouldn't be able to grow a longer member because their penises are already so extreme. ""They're at the evolutionary end of how far you can push a penis,"" she said. In this group, dominant males were physically intimidating the smaller ducks. Brennan found that, as a result, some of the smaller ruddy ducks showed a reproductive delay, and took a longer time to reach reproductive maturation. ""He's beating up everybody else so they can't quite grow a penis as long as they normally would,"" she said, explaining that the males would rush to peck any other smaller males that display to females. ""So you have a bunch of males that are trying to grow these penises, and then the dominant male is trying to prevent them from doing so."" That came as a surprise. ""The reproductive suppression of dominant males is known in some [mammal] species, but in birds we didn't really have an evidence that this could happen."" Brennan plans to continue studying duck penises. ""It's a cool example of yet another way in which evolution can result in elaborate genitalia,"" she said. ""Individuals have the ability to be very strategic about when they're going to grow longer penises or shorter penises.""

2018-11-14 17:44:51,2018,11.0,14,Amazon’s HQ2 in Virginia Leaves a Real Estate Firm Poised to Cash In,"Two years ago, Matt Kelly couldn’t have known that a failed merger involving his real estate firm would propel him toward a central role in Amazon’s expansion plans. In May 2016, Mr. Kelly and his firm, then known as the JBG Companies, had an agreement to merge with a large real estate investment trust based in New York. But shareholders of the New York fund balked, and the deal collapsed. A few months later, JBG, based in Chevy Chase, Md., had a new partner. In a deal valued at $8.4 billion, JBG merged with a Washington unit spun off from the real estate behemoth Vornado Realty Trust. The new company, JBG Smith, with Mr. Kelly as chief executive, became the dominant landowner in a Northern Virginia region now being called National Landing, a dilapidated area that includes parts of Crystal City, Pentagon City and Potomac Yard. Amazon announced on Tuesday that it was choosing this area, along with New York City, for two new headquarters, with 50,000 employees between them. Since Amazon started its search for a so-called HQ2 over a year ago, the Washington region had been considered a front-runner. The region gives the company access to a large, tech-savvy work force and the transportation and infrastructure it wanted. Additionally, Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has a home in the area. For Mr. Kelly, Amazon’s decision validated a plan that he had been selling for the better part of a year: revitalizing Crystal City and its neighbors. Mr. Kelly’s pitch was to turn a ghost town, as it has been described, into a thriving hot spot, including public green space and hip new retailers and entertainment venues. The plan relied on redeveloping 1970s-era office towers into sleek residential buildings. Skeptical investors have become believers, sending shares of JBG Smith up 7 percent in the past month. Analysts warn that Amazon most likely flexed its muscles to negotiate a deal with highly favorable terms, possibly pushing for below-market leases in an area that already trends well below national and Washington averages. For JBG Smith, the HQ2 deal may pay off in an uptick in occupancy and rents for residential, retail and other properties it owns adjacent to Amazon’s new offices. But it could take five to seven years for this bonanza to arrive, said Danny Ismail, an analyst and lead of office coverage for the real estate research firm Green Street Advisors. “This isn’t going to be an overnight thing,” Mr. Ismail said. Amazon said it intended to lease 500,000 square feet of office space in three buildings owned by JBG Smith. Amazon has also agreed to buy numerous plots of land held by JBG Smith that could be developed for an extra 4.1 million square feet. The purchase price of the land and other terms were not disclosed. JBG Smith officials did not respond to requests for comment. But in the announcement on Tuesday, the firm said it planned to accelerate construction on other projects in the area, including developments that would create more office and retail space as well as hundreds of residential units. Amazon’s move is a chance for JBG Smith to turn lemons into lemonade. For the past year, JBG Smith’s publicly traded real estate investment trust has trailed its peers, largely because of Crystal City and adjoining areas, which make up about a third of JBG Smith’s portfolio. Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty first developed Crystal City in the 1960s and 1970s, and Vornado acquired that company in 2002. The Crystal City holdings eventually became an albatross for Vornado. Crystal City was once a thriving hub of government agencies and military contractors, but its fortunes sank after a 2005 mandate, in part for antiterrorism concerns, to relocate thousands of jobs from suburban office buildings to nearby military bases. In the following years, Crystal City lost 17,000 jobs, and 4.2 million square feet of office space became vacant. Since then, occupancy rates in the Crystal City region have hovered around 85 percent, among the lowest in the country, analysts say. But champions for the area argued that it still had plenty to offer a big employer, starting with its proximity to Ronald Reagan National Airport. “It’s the only place I’ve ever worked where you could walk to an airport. It’s unique in its location and infrastructure,” said Mitch Bonanno, a former senior vice president and director of development who oversaw the Washington team for Vornado/Charles E. Smith. JBG traces its roots to the late 1950s when three lawyers — Benjamin Jacobs, Donald Brown, and Joseph Gildenhorn — started a law and real estate firm in Rockville, Md. Through the 1970s and 1980s, the firm acquired and developed a number of high-profile properties in the Washington area, including the Four Seasons hotel in Georgetown and projects for the World Bank and the insurer Geico. In the 2000s, JBG began raising money from institutional investors for a series of funds that it used to invest in commercial real estate around Washington. JBG redeveloped part of Shaw, an inner-city neighborhood that was devastated by the 1968 riots after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It called the area North End Shaw, a neighborhood geared toward millennials that featured stylish apartment buildings, trendy retailers like the eyewear company Warby Parker and a movie theater with a bar. In the spring of 2016, JBG was looking to expand. It announced a merger with New York REIT, a deal that would have made JBG a public entity, making it easier to raise money to buy properties. The deal also would have diversified JBG’s portfolio into the New York City area. But New York REIT investors balked and by the end of the summer, the arrangement had been terminated. A few weeks later, JBG was being courted by Vornado. It wasn’t their first flirtation. A few years earlier, Vornado’s chief executive, Steven Roth, raised the idea of merging the firm’s Washington property portfolio with JBG to form a separate, publicly traded business, according to a 2016 transcript from a Vornado earnings call. But JBG wasn’t sold on the idea of going public and talks broke down. But the second time around, they struck a deal. The merger made JBG Smith a commanding player in the Washington market and, this week, a potential big winner in Amazon’s plans. “While hard to quantify,” analysts at Stifel Financial wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday, “this clearly drives up the value” of JBG’s future development pipeline. An earlier version of this article misstated the Maryland city where the firm that eventually became JBG Smith was founded.

2016-01-20 00:00:00,2016,1.0,20,Restaurants pack in as many calories as fast food chains," (CNN)Many chain restaurants and fast-food joints now post calorie information on their menus, even before they will be required to by federal law at the end of 2016, making it obvious how calorie-laden their meals can be.  Non-chain restaurants are often seen as the healthier choice, even though -- or perhaps because -- the number of calories in their meals is a mystery. But a new study finds that these meals are generally just as calorie-rich as similar meals at chain restaurants. Researchers determined the calorie content of the most popular dinners at independent eateries around Boston, San Francisco and Little Rock, Arkansas. In each area, they included about a dozen restaurants across a range of cuisines, from American burger joints to Italian trattorias and Greek cafes. The researchers determined the average dinner at a non-chain restaurant had about 1,200 calories, which they found was similar to comparable dinners at chain restaurants and around half of the daily energy requirement for adults. Women are recommended to consume about 2,000 calories a day to maintain their weight, whereas men can reach about 2,500 calories a day. ""Many nutritionists say fast food is making us obese, but that's just because they tell us their calories. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Non-chain restaurants are just as bad as chain restaurants,"" said Susan B. Roberts, director of the Energy Metabolism Laboratory at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. Roberts led the research, which was published Wednesday in the Journal of Nutrition and Dietetics. ""I think chain restaurants are better personally because you can make informed choices,"" she said. Roberts and her colleagues found a lot of variability between different types of cuisines. American, Italian, Chinese and Indian meals had the most calories on average, whereas Greek, Vietnamese and Mexican tended to have the fewest. Across the range of cuisines, 92% of the dinners the researchers tested contained more than 570 calories, which they consider the appropriate number of calories for the average adult woman to consume at lunch and dinner. ""All of the popular choices have grossly excessive numbers of calories,"" Roberts said. One of the unexpected findings for Roberts was that dishes she has recommended to her clients, such as grilled chicken tikka at Indian restaurants, were much higher in calories at some restaurants. ""They must be soaking the chicken in oil or yogurt because it has 200 or 300 more calories between restaurants,"" she said. It would be hard for consumers to notice the difference, she added.  The findings were surprising in general, said Marian Jarlenski, assistant professor of health policy and management at the University of Pittsburgh, who was not involved in the study. ""The intuitive hypothesis is that non-chains would be healthier. This may be an American thing; we think local is better, and better in this case might be healthier,"" she said. Jarlenski was particularly struck by the finding that meals with the smallest portion sizes were not necessarily low in calories. ""My personal strategy is to eat whatever I want as long as it's (a small portion), but I may be getting just as many calories if I'm ordering something that has a lot of calorie-dense ingredients,"" she said. What consumers can do The number of calories served at a restaurant is an important issue because Americans eat out so much. One estimate is that the average American adult eats meals or snacks at restaurants about six times a week. ""The weight of the evidence suggests that restaurant eating is a contributor to obesity in the United States,"" Jarlenski said. ""Consumers should be aware to eat out in moderation ... restaurant eating is most likely not going to be as healthy as cooking with fresh ingredients at home,"" Jarlenski said.  For her part, Roberts thinks that advising people not to eat out so much is like ""telling the tide not to rise."" ""People like eating out, and it's likely to become even more frequent. We need ways to help people deal with it better,"" she said. One of the easy things that consumers can do is ask for cheese and dressing on the side when they order. ""You can just sprinkle a little on. A lot of the calories come from these high-calorie add-ons,"" Roberts said. It is also possible to curb how much you eat and get a doggie bag for leftovers, but many of us do not have this kind of willpower.   ""The easiest solution is if you say up front (to the server), 'I'd like to take a half-portion and you can give me the other portion to take home,' but it's kind of embarrassing unless you know the people you eat out with well,"" she said. Should non-chain restaurants post calorie information?  Although it may help consumers to get calorie information at independent restaurants just like at chain restaurants, ""I don't think simply disclosing (this information) is going to have a huge effect,"" Roberts said. Although it could steer some toward lower-calorie options, people with less money may order the largest number of calories they can afford, she said. In addition, ""providing the caloric content information might affect restaurant behavior rather than consumer behavior,"" such as spurring restaurants to make their meals healthier or make their portions smaller, Jarlenski said. Roberts says the impact of restaurants offering smaller portions -- such as half- or third-portions, for half or a third of the price -- should be explored. ""Restaurants will say, 'We can't possibly do that,' but if everyone were required (by law) to do that, the playing field (would be) level,"" she said. ""I would eat out every night of the week if I could do that.""  Although Roberts doubts the calorie load at non-chain restaurants in other parts of the United States would be much better, it is hard to say how eateries in other cities and in rural areas would stack up. The three cities in the study -- Boston, San Francisco and Little Rock -- differ in their demographics and their obesity rates.  ""I would have thought that San Francisco (restaurants) would be better than Boston and Little Rock ... because San Francisco is one of the lowest-BMI cities,"" Jarlenski said. That just goes to show that many other factors, in addition to calories in restaurant food, contribute to obesity rates, such as how often people go out to eat and how much exercise they get, she added.

2017-12-15 00:00:00,2017,12.0,15,Regulator slaps conditions on D.Telekom all-you-can-watch video product,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s regulator ordered Deutsche Telekom on Friday to offer an all-you-can-watch video product on the same terms throughout the European Union, in a decision the company slammed as “incomprehensible”, saying it would appeal. Telekom’s ‘StreamOn’ option charges nothing for data used watching video-on-demand services and seeks to emulate the success of its T-Mobile US unit, which has gained on its rivals by providing Netflix “on us”. In its ruling, the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) said Deutsche Telekom would have to make Stream-On available in compliance with the European Union’s rules on roaming and net neutrality. That would require Telekom to abide by the “roam like at home” principle, under which charges should be the same regardless of where the customer is in the European Union. Net neutrality means there should be no differential throttling of data speeds depending on location. “Stream-On can continue to be offered by Telekom. In the interest of consumers, adjustments are necessary,” BNetzA President Jochen Homann said in a statement. “StreamOn must uphold the roam-like-at-home principle and customers must have access to video streaming in unrestricted bandwidth.” Telekom has until the end of March 2018 to comply. The ruling comes a day after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal net neutrality rules that entered force in 2015. The decision marked a victory for telecoms by making it easier for them to funnel customers to their preferred content partners. Deutsche Telekom said it had signed up 700,000 customers for StreamOn, which is available as a free add-on to its MagentaMobil product range in Germany that costs between 30 and 70 euros ($35-$83) a month depending on the amount of data used for other purposes. That number is growing by 20,000 a week. “Today’s decision is clearly directed against the interests of customers, because the economic basis of a free offering is being put into doubt,” the company said. “For that reason, the regulator’s decision is absolutely incomprehensible.” Telekom will examine how the ruling can be implemented while continuing to offer its StreamOn product. “We see no reason to change our legal opinion and will therefore appeal,” it said. “By taking legal action we will fight so that our customers can continue to use StreamOn while the legal situation is being clarified.” Reporting by Douglas Busvine; Editing by Adrian Croft",https://www.reuters.com/article/deutsche-telekom-regulator/regulator-slaps-conditions-on-dtelekom-all-you-can-watch-video-product-idUSL8N1OF3XO,Technology News,Reuters,technology,387
2017-11-15 00:00:00,2017,11.0,15,Red or dead: China shoot-em-up video game plays up socialist values,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A popular Chinese video game, which involves battling other players with a variety of weapons, is showing off its red credentials after recent criticism by regulators of violent games in the world’s biggest gaming market. China’s content regulator said late last month it was unlikely to give licenses to gory, violent video games that deviated from core socialist values and that went against traditional Chinese culture and morals. But “Wildness Action”, a battleground game developed by China’s NetEase, may have found a solution. It has added red banners into the game with slogans such as “safeguard national security, safeguard world peace”. The state-run Global Times newspaper said late on Tuesday the game had changed violent elements into “harmonious ones with Chinese characteristics” and had slogans with excerpts from a report delivered at the recent Communist Party congress. Under President Xi Jinping, China has been on a drive to cleanse online content, from video streaming to games, to meet strict rules that ban material that is too violent or goes against Communist Party values. NetEase did not respond to requests for comment. However, in an earlier statement posted prominently on the game’s official website, NetEase said it would act “strictly in accordance” with regulators’ guidance and would tweak its games to make sure they adhered to “core socialist values”. NetEase and rival game developer Tencent Holdings Ltd dominate China’s fast-growing gaming market, which is set to rake in $27.5 billion in sales this year, according to gaming consultancy Newzoo. China criticized top-selling “PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds” last month - a South Korea-made multiplayer game, whose players kill to be the last survivor. Wildness Action is seen as a close imitation of that game.

2019-10-17 00:00:00,2019,10.0,17,"Big income drops tied to heart attack, stroke","(Reuters Health) - Experiencing a substantial drop in income may raise the risk of having a heart attack or stroke years later, a recent study suggests. Researchers followed income changes for 8,989 middle-aged adults over six years, starting when they were 53 years old, on average. Most people had relatively steady income during this period, but 10% saw their pay cut by more than half and 20% had their income surge by at least 50%. None of the participants had a history of heart attack, stroke or heart failure at the start of the study period. After an average follow-up of 17 years, people who experienced a huge pay reduction were 17% more likely to have a heart attack, stroke, or heart failure than participants with steady or rising income. The increased risk might be due to a biological response to stress in addition to financial hardship, said Dr. Edward Havranek, author of an editorial accompanying the study and director of Medicine at Denver Health Medical Center in Colorado. “While chronic stress raises blood pressure and probably causes inflammation that affects blood vessels, I tend to believe the social and economic effects are more important,” Havranek said by email. “A sudden income drop likely makes it harder to afford healthcare, and forces people to pay attention to money rather than taking good care of themselves,” Havranek added. And not everyone loses income because they lose their job, he noted. “Loss of a spouse through death or divorce can cause a large income drop; these things obviously pay a toll on us.” Among participants who experienced substantial income declines, average household income dropped from $40,516 to $14,655, researchers report in JAMA Cardiology. For individuals with steady earnings, average household income dipped slightly from $43,897 to $43,057. And, for the lucky ones whose fortunes improved dramatically, average household income rose from $26,099 to $53,347. These people with large income gains were 14% less likely to have a heart attack, stroke, or heart failure than their counterparts with steady earnings. Diminished income appeared to negatively impact heart health more for white than for black individuals in the study. Improved earnings appeared to positively impact heart health more for women than for men, the study also found. One limitation of the study is the potential for “reverse causation,” in other words, it’s possible failing health caused the loss of income or employment, instead of the reduced earnings causing heart problems, the study team acknowledges. Still, less income can lead to a variety of issues that might compromise heart health including a loss of health insurance, financial stress, eating more high-calorie and unhealthy foods, and drinking and smoking, said the study’s lead author, Stephen Wang. “Social factors like income can have a significant impact on an individual’s health,” Wang said. Banking three to six months of expenses to use in case of job loss or an emergency might help people minimize the risk of heart problems associated with a substantial reduction in earnings, Wang, who did the research while at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, said by email. “Having close friends and family for support during financially stressful times may also reduce risk,” added Wang, who is currently at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth in Hanover, New Hampshire. “Lastly, since income drops are so common, it’s important for our society to create safety nets to support individuals when these situations occur.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2VOg3Dq and bit.ly/2Bgwtv9 JAMA Cardiology, online October 9, 2019.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-heart-income/big-income-drops-tied-to-heart-attack-stroke-idUSKBN1WW2QU,Health News,Reuters,health,583
2018-11-05 00:00:00,2018,11.0,5,"Spanking kids: Choose 'healthy' discipline instead, pediatricians urge"," (CNN)The American Academy of Pediatrics has hardened its stance against spanking children as a form of parental discipline. In a new policy statement, published in the journal Pediatrics on Monday, the pediatricians' group recommends that adults caring for children use ""healthy forms of discipline"" -- such as positive reinforcement of appropriate behaviors, setting limits and setting expectations -- and not use spanking, hitting, slapping, threatening, insulting, humiliating or shaming. The policy statement updates guidance published in 1998 that recommended ""parents be encouraged and assisted in developing methods other than spanking in response to undesired behavior.""  ""In the 20 years since that policy was first published, there's been a great deal of additional research, and we're now much stronger in saying that parents should never hit their child and never use verbal insults that would humiliate or shame the child,"" said Dr. Robert Sege, first author of the policy statement and a pediatrician at the Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. ""This is much stronger than the previous advice,"" he said. ""The new policy encourages pediatricians to discuss the data about different kinds of discipline with parents so, of course, they can make their own decisions in how they chose to raise their children.""   The policy statement describes corporal punishment as ""noninjurious, open-handed hitting with the intention of modifying child behavior"" and indicates that spanking is considered a form of such physical punishment. The statement goes on to describe how several studies have found associations between spanking and aggressive child behavior, depressive symptoms in adolescence and less gray matter in children's brains, among other outcomes. How to discipline without spanking The statement encourages pediatricians to counsel the parents of their patients when they may want guidance about the use of spanking. Sege said there are other forms of discipline that parents can employ, no matter their child's age. For instance, for children younger than 1 who might be misbehaving, ""the best thing to do is just pick them up and move them somewhere else, distract them, change the subject -- and that's usually all they need and they can handle it,"" he said. ""Your average 6-month-old child doesn't have the ability to learn the rules. They will eventually."" For toddlers and preschoolers, Sege recommended using the time-out method, which involves a child sitting quietly by him- or herself. ""What we talk to parents about is paying attention to your child's good behavior and paying less attention when they're misbehaving,"" Sege said.  ""Kids like attention, they crave that, and if they misbehave, we recommend something called a time-out,"" he said. ""If they're 2 years old, you have to ignore them for two entire minutes."" For older children, Sege said, typically allowing the natural consequence of misbehavior play out can be effective. ""So if they run out in the street, you don't want the natural consequence to be that they get run over by a car. But a natural consequence might be that they have to hold your hand when they're in the street or they can't go out on their own past a busy street until you've observed them always looking both ways,"" Sege said. In other words, holding Mom's or Dad's hand becomes the consequence. All in all, ""the loving relationship between a child and their parents is the most important relationship that there is,"" Sege said.  ""Parents can use that relationship to teach their children right from wrong without inserting violence, shame and humiliation into that relationship,"" he said. ""As a result, children are more likely to grow up feeling secure and positive, knowing how to regulate their own behavior."" The science on spanking and child development The policy statement is consistent with what research has found on the relationship between corporal punishment and adverse outcomes among children, said Rebecca Ryan, a developmental psychologist and associate professor at Georgetown University who was not involved in the statement.  Yet Ryan, who has studied the use of corporal punishment, noted that only a correlational relationship has been found, not a causal one. ""Nobody has randomly assigned children to receive different types of parenting or different types of discipline strategies, per se. ... So it's difficult for anybody to say spanking a child causes that child later on to be more aggressive, even though there are theories to suggest that could be why the correlation exists,"" Ryan said. ""Although all the evidence is correlational, there's little correlational evidence that it's an effective strategy, and if it were effective, you should see correlational evidence,"" she said.  ""If it were an effective strategy, you would either see no correlation between spanking and child behavior, or you would see a correlation that's the opposite of what you do see,"" she said. ""What you see is a positive correlation between spanking and higher levels of behavior problems. If it were effective you should see the opposite."" Since research shows only a correlational relationship, some question whether children who are more aggressive or misbehave more are subsequently spanked more -- and could that be why corporal punishment has been linked with higher levels of behavioral problems among children? ""There probably is reverse causation, but one of the things that some of the longitudinal research suggests is that when you look at kids over time -- so controlling for baseline rates of misbehavior -- children who are disciplined with corporal punishment versus those who are not, who have the same kinds of behavior problems, show increases in behavior problems over time in a way that children who aren't disciplined that way don't,"" Ryan said.  ""So yes, there is probably some truth to the idea that kids who are predisposed to misbehavior for whatever reason are more likely to be spanked by parents who use that form of discipline than kids who are less likely to misbehave for whatever reason,"" she said. ""But it's also true that spanking is correlated with an increase in behavior problems over time among children with similar levels of misbehavior relative to nonphysical forms of discipline.""

2019-10-03 00:00:00,2019,10.0,3,"The world will have more than 250 million obese kids by 2030, a new report warns"," (CNN)More than 250 million school-aged children and adolescents will be classed as obese by 2030, putting huge pressure on healthcare systems, a new report on childhood obesity warns.  There are currently 158 million obese children around the world, according to the World Obesity Federation's first Atlas of Childhood Obesity, which calculated a risk score for obesity in the coming decade for 191 countries. The report said children in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America were particularly at risk, as a result of fast changing lifestyles along with the growing popularity and aggressive marketing of junk food.  ""There's a transition away from traditional diets and ways of doing things. People are expending less energy, becoming more sedentary and adopting a Western-style diet that's high in sugar, oil, starch and fat,"" Dr Tim Lobstein, director of policy at the WOF and one of the authors of the the report, told CNN. The report said that no country included in the atlas would meet a target agreed to at a World Health Organization summit in 2013, which mandated that levels of childhood obesity should be no higher in 2025 than they were between 2010 and 2012. It added that four out of five countries it assessed had a less than 10% chance of doing so.  Dr. Lobstein said he had been surprised by the ""extraordinary increase"" in the number of obese children forecast by the report.  As childhood obesity is closely associated with obesity in adulthood, it would place a huge burden on health systems given the link with chronic diseases like diabetes, he warned. ""That's a massive leap. It will flood health systems, particularly in developing countries,"" he said. In the United States 26.3% of five to nine year olds and 24.2% of 10 to 19 year olds would be obese by 2030, the report said, giving the country a 17% chance of meeting the WHO 2025 target. In absolute terms, the US is expected to have 17 million obese children by 2030, the largest number after China and India.  Pacific islands like the Cook Islands and Palau ranked high among the countries most at risk in the coming decade. Lobstein said that, in addition to less active lifestyles, island nations were more reliant on food imports, which were often highly processed and heavy on sugar and fat.  Lobstein said that governments around the world were reluctant to take on large food companies that had a vested increase in the status quo. He said that initiatives like sugar and soda taxes would have only a small impact, particularly because they were hard to enact in lower income countries, where governments were more likely to be persuaded by commercial interests.  He added that he thought a younger generation would take a more activist stance towards obesity -- as they have done toward climate change. ""Most people don't want to have excess weight but there shouldn't be a stigma against the individual. It's a social problem not a private problem."" he said.

IDC said Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) Apple Watch was expected to lead the market this year with a 49.4 percent share, followed by Android Wear watches - powered by Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Android operating system - with a 21.4 percent share. Apple is expected to ship 14 million units of Apple Watch this year, up from 11.6 million units estimated for 2015. Shipments of Android Wear watches, made by companies including LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS) and Motorola, are expected to touch 6.1 million units in 2016, IDC said on Thursday. “Although smartwatches like the Apple Watch or Android Wear devices capture the spotlight, they will only account for a quarter of all wearables in 2016...” said IDC analyst Jitesh Ubrani. Shipments of Apple Watch could slow in early 2016 in anticipation of a newer version, IDC said. The wearable devices market is expected to grow in double-digit percent through 2015 to 2020, with shipments hitting 237.1 million units in 2020, IDC said. Wearable devices include watches and wristbands that can sync with a user’s smartphone and track heart rate and calories burned, among other data. However, the category has been expanding with the launch of new products such as clothing, eyewear and audio devices.

2019-07-17 00:00:00,2019,7.0,17,Maintaining or starting exercise in middle age tied to longer life,"(Reuters Health) - Even if they were inactive during their younger years, middle aged and older adults who get at least the minimum recommended amount of exercise each week may live longer than their sedentary counterparts, suggests a large UK study. Physical activity has long been linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. But most research has looked at exercise habits at a single point in time rather than activity patterns across the years, researchers note in The BMJ. For the current study, researchers assessed activity levels several times over eight years for 14,599 men and women who were between 40 and 80 years old at the outset. After the first eight years, researchers started tracking mortality for another 12.5 years, on average. During that period, there were 3,148 deaths, including 950 from cardiovascular disease and 1,091 from cancer. The researchers measured both work and leisure-time physical activity in terms of energy expended per kilogram of body weight. Activity increases over time that were equivalent to going from sedentary to meeting the World Health Organization’s recommendation of at least 150 minutes a week of moderate physical activity were associated with a 24% lower risk of death from any cause, a 29% lower risk of cardiovascular death and an 11% lower risk of cancer death compared to those who remained inactive. “This sends a strong message to all of us, irrespective of what our current life circumstances may be, since it is never too late to build physical activity into your daily routine in order to enjoy a longer healthier life,” said Soren Brage, senior author of the study and a researcher at the University of Cambridge in the UK. “Everybody benefitted from becoming more active,” Brage said by email. “This was also true for the subgroup of people who already had a serious chronic condition such as heart disease and cancer at baseline.” The reduced risk of death linked to increasing activity was present regardless of past activity levels and improvements or even worsening of other risk factors such as diet, body weight, medical history, blood pressure and cholesterol levels over the years. Compared to consistently inactive people, adults who shifted from being inactive to “low” activity levels were 24% less likely to die of any causes during the study, while people who reached “medium” activity levels were 38% less likely to die and adults who achieved “high” activity levels were 42% less likely to die. At the population level, the researchers calculated, getting at least 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity physical activity would potentially prevent 46% of deaths associated with physical inactivity. The study wasn’t designed to prove whether or how exercise, or changes in activity over time, might directly prevent disease or help people live longer. Even so, it adds to evidence suggesting that changing exercise habits late in life can still make a difference, said Dr. I-Min Lee, a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston who wasn’t involved in the study. Other studies that randomly assigned inactive people to start exercising or maintain their current lifestyle have found, among other things, that starting to exercise can improve blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol levels, and inflammation and reduce belly fat, Lee said by email. “Becoming physically active in mid-life can extend longevity,” Lee said.

2020-03-05 00:00:00,2020,3.0,5,Doctors may feel 'moral distress' when surrogates make decisions,"(Reuters Health) - When patients cannot make their own decisions about life-prolonging care, many doctors feel “moral distress” acting on the choices of surrogates like family members, a small survey suggests. Doctors most often felt ethical strain when the patient was older or the surrogate wanted more life-sustaining treatment than the doctor felt appropriate, researchers report in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. “Moral distress, especially when it goes unaddressed, is associated with physician burnout,” said coauthor Lucia Wocial, a nurse ethicist at Indiana University Health in Indianapolis. “The more we learn about what contributes to physician moral distress, the more we can intervene to help them to overcome barriers to doing what they feel is the right thing to do,” she told Reuters Health by email. Wocial and colleagues analyzed survey responses from 154 doctors with patients in intensive care units who lacked the capacity to make decisions. Surrogate decision-makers for 362 patients also took part in the survey. Doctors reported experiencing moral distress when caring for 152 of the patients, or about 42%. In general, disagreements between the doctor and surrogate about the plan of care didn’t cause much distress. Instead, doctors were more likely to feel moral conflict when facing a decision about life-sustaining treatment, especially when the doctor preferred a comfort-focused or hospice-focused plan. “One of the hardest experiences I have had as a physician was the feeling that I was doing something to a patient that wasn’t in their best interest or what they would have wanted,” said coauthor Dr. Alexia Torke of the Indiana University Center for Aging Research at the Regenstrief Institute. “When a physician has this feeling, it can be a sign that something has gone wrong. We ought to pay attention to this,” she told Reuters Health by email. “It might be a sign that we are not communicating effectively with our patients or their families about the outcomes of some of the treatments we provide, especially treatments that can be burdensome or ineffective.” Moral distress occurred more often when the doctor was male and the patient was older, but it was less common when patients lived in a nursing home. When doctors felt confident about what mattered to the patient, either through a living will or by talking to family members who knew the patient’s wishes, they were less likely to feel distress and felt they could make clearer recommendations and suggest choices that were consistent with the patient’s values. “Our own work has found that most of the causes of moral distress in the critical care setting are ‘system’ issues, such as inadequate communication and inadequate advance care planning,” said Dr. Peter Dodek of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, who wasn’t involved in the study. “Addressing this issue is not just a personal task for healthcare workers - it also requires system improvements,” Dodek told Reuters Health by email. For patients and families, this could mean clearer communication about advance directives and living wills before a family member loses decision-making capacity. “Advance directives can be helpful in reducing family members’ stress, anxiety and depression,” said Beth Epstein of the University of Virginia’s Center for Biomedical Ethics and Humanities in Charlottesville, who also wasn’t part of the current study. “Now, it looks like advance directives and patient conversations about future medical wishes can be helpful to healthcare providers, too, in terms of reduced moral distress,” she said by email.

2018-02-15 16:38:00,2018,2.0,15,"Flu Shot Only Worked 36 Percent of the Time, CDC Says","Between Nov. 2 and Feb. 3, total vaccine effectiveness was estimated at 36 percent, according to a report released Thursday by the CDC. When broken down by strain, however, efficacy varied widely. H3N2, the dominant strain circulating this flu season, is notoriously more virulent and less receptive to vaccination than other types of influenza. True to form, vaccine effectiveness against this strain was low this year — approximately 25 percent, according to the CDC report. (That’s actually better than experts originally feared, based on trends from Canada and Australia, where the flu vaccine was only about 10 percent effective.) By contrast, the report says the shot worked an estimated 67 percent of the time against the less-severe H1N1 and 42% of the time against influenza B viruses. The shot’s efficacy also depends on a person’s age. Among children between the ages of six months and eight years, for example, the shot reduced the risk of H3N2 illness by 59 percent, according to the report. A 36 percentage rate of effectiveness may not seem very impressive, but the CDC emphasizes in the report that even small increases in immunity can have a large impact on public health. CDC data has shown that even in 2014-2015, a year when vaccine effectiveness didn’t even hit 20 percent, immunizations prevented as many as 144,000 flu-related hospitalizations and 4,000 deaths. Plus, people who get the shot, but who still end up getting sick, tend to have less severe illnesses than unvaccinated people. With weeks left to go in flu season — and strains other than H3N2 starting to circulate more widely — CDC officials are still pushing vaccination, in hopes of mitigating the impact of what has been a particularly brutal epidemic. Flu has been unusually prevalent this year, with 93 percent of CDC-monitored jurisdictions reporting widespread activity for three consecutive weeks in January, according to a CDC report. Hospitalizations have also broken records, and by season’s end may even eclipse the 710,000 admissions seen during the high-severity 2014-2015 season. Flu- and pneumonia-related deaths have also been common, ranging from 5.8 percent to 10.1 percent of all deaths nationwide throughout the course of the season. During a call with reporters last week, CDC Acting Director Dr. Anne Schuchat also said that death rates are likely to rise in the coming weeks, as “the people who are likely to die may already be in the hospital.” Sixty-three pediatric deaths have been recorded so far, and only 14 of those patients had gotten the flu shot, according to the new report. In addition to getting vaccinated, the CDC is urging people to see a doctor and stay home from school or work if they come down with the flu.",https://people.com/health/this-years-flu-shot-only-worked-36-percent-of-the-time-cdc-says/,health,People,health,452
2017-06-22 22:53:00,2017,6.0,22,Police Arrest People in Wheelchairs at Senate Health Bill Protest,"This morning, as lawmakers and the public were waiting for the draft of the Senate health bill to be released, a group of people with disabilities staged a protest outside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office. The ""die-in"" protest was organized by disability activist group ADAPT, which, according to its site, organizes ""nonviolent direct action, including civil disobedience."" Yet Capitol Police removed protesters and made 43 arrests, charging people with crowding, obstructing, or incommoding. The Senate bill was expected to drastically remake Medicaid and changes to Medicaid would affect people with disabilities a great deal: the federal program insures 30 percent of adults and 60 percent of kids with disabilities. (Medicaid also covers 40 percent of low income adults, 64 percent of nursing home residents, and 20 percent of all Americans, so it's a big deal for a lot of people, not just the disabled community.)  The draft bill was worse than expected. It changes Medicaid from an open-ended program to one with a capped rate per number of enrollees, all while chipping away at those funding pools by tying them to a smaller inflation rate. Former Medicaid director Andy Slavitt also pointed out that eligibility for the individual insurance market starts at 0 percent of the federal poverty line in the bill, which means states could technically eliminate Medicaid and funnel people into the exchanges with no help. Finally, it would end the Medicaid expansion between 2020 and 2024—though eight states would see the expansion end in 2020 because of how their laws are written—meaning at least 10 million people who gained insurance under Obamacare would lose it. Things got ugly. The Capitol Police said in a statement that ""many of the demonstrators, as part of their protest activities, removed themselves from their wheelchairs and lay themselves on the floor, obstructing passage through the hallway and into nearby offices. U.S. Capitol Police officers warned the demonstrators to cease their unlawful activities or be faced with arrest.""

2020-01-09 00:00:00,2020,1.0,9,Alibaba praised by China's gay community for ad recognizing same-sex couples,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Online gay communities in China are lauding e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd for releasing a subtle ad that appears to feature a gay couple returning home for the Lunar New Year. In the 20-second spot, a young man enters his home and introduces a male companion as “Kelvin” to his mother. The camera cuts to a father figure leering at the couple with suspicion, and then to two girls sitting at the table who giggle knowingly. The ad ends when Kelvin refers to his partner’s father as “Dad,” causing an awkward silence at the table. The narrator then promotes a site-wide discount on dried seeds and nuts, riffing a Chinese-language expression for watching drama unfold. The spot began to circulate widely on Chinese social media on Wednesday as gay groups praised it for its good-natured humor and subtlety. “Chinese New Year is a time for family reunion and inclusion, and the ad is a creative expression to celebrate such an occasion,” an Alibaba spokesperson said in a statement. Depictions of gay and lesbian individuals in entertainment and media are rare, due to government dissuasion or outright censorship. However, China has vibrant gay communities and activists in its major cities, and same sex couples are increasingly tolerated across society. Lovematters, a popular gay-themed account on China’s Twitter-esque Weibo, shared and thanked Alibab’s e-commerce site Tmall for supporting the gay community. The account’s post received over 25,000 shares. “The support of large companies for sexual minorities is one of the important factors for sexual minorities to gain visibility and be seen and recognized by the public. Thank you Tmall!” wrote Lovematters. Alibaba did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for further comment on the ad. One top-rated comment on Weibo described the position of the Alibaba’s ad as clever. The spot “doesn’t directly support or not support [same-sex realtions], but the fact that we can see it is already an amazing step,” the commentor wrote. Alibaba has supported China’s gay community in the past. In 2017, the company teamed up with gay dating app Blued and flew 10 couples to Los Angeles for a week-long trip that included a group wedding ceremony.

2016-05-04 06:01:00,2016,5.0,4,How a Hacker Can Take Over Your Life by Hijacking Your Phone Number,"In 2014, UK authorities warned that criminals were taking over victim's cell phone numbers and using them to get into the victim's bank accounts. Now, a social engineering expert is warning that taking control of someone's phone number is easier than previously thought, thanks to a code normally made of three letters and six numbers called the Porting Authorisation Code, or PAC.  All a criminal needs to know for this fraud is the victim's phone number, name, some other information that can usually be found online, such as their date of birth, and some simple social engineering skills to trick cell phone carriers' support agents into giving out the code, according to Richard De Vere, a consultant who specializes in social engineering.  De Vere, who is the director and principal consultant at The AntiSocial Engineer, said he initially got the idea of using PAC codes to take over people's cell phone numbers when he got a code for himself six months ago. PACs are free codes that cell phone companies are required to provide to customers when they want to switch operators while keeping their number.  The whole process ""was a bit too easy,"" he told Motherboard. So he decided to test just how easy it is to get PACs from other UK cell phone carriers. De Vere detailed his findings, including videos showing how he tricked operators to give up a PAC code for his cell phone number in a blog post published on Wednesday.  ""The issue with PAC numbers is they have to get from the operator to the customer as securely as possible,"" De Vere wrote in the post. ""A big part of this transaction is the trust an operator must place in a caller. They should all work on securing this trust better.""  As it turns out, some UK telephone carriers, such as EE and Three, gave De Vere the codes directly over the phone, despite the fact that he was calling from another number (a landline at that) and at times even providing incorrect verification information, such as the amount of the last ""top up,"" or account refill.  That should ""never, ever"" happen, according to De Vere, because it makes things ""easy"" for the criminals. Operators should call the mobile phone number, or send it via SMS instead, De Vere said.  De Vere was simply testing this on numbers he owned, but if he had been a criminal taking over other people's phone numbers, he could have done real damage. Once in control of the numbers, he said, he could've use it to approve bank transactions with SMS notifications, bypass two-factor authentication on online accounts such as Gmail, and do other types of fraud.  That's why De Vere wants operators to be more careful when giving out PAC codes.  ""This isn't about bashing brands, this is about securing people en masse,"" he wrote in his post.  Three, and GiffGaff did not respond to Motherboard's request for comment. EE admitted that the support agent who talked to De Vere did not follow the ""standard protocol"" to hand out PAC codes, but declined to specify exactly what the standard protocol is, saying only that the company asks ""for a range of details for authentication and it appears as though that didn't happen fully this time."" The spokesperson also added that EE normally requires the SIM number or ID, as the company's agent did in the phone call with De Vere. O2, which was the company that fared best according to De Vere, said he was able to ""pass a two-step authentication in order to have his PAC code shared with him verbally,"" but that happened only because he had the target cell phone under his control and he received a PIN code the company sent to him. If he hadn't been able to verify the receipt of the PIN code, the company would have not shared the PAC code verbally, an O2 spokesperson said.  Vodafone said the support agent agreed to send the PAC via text message because De Vere answered all security questions correctly other than the top up amount. ""This approach ensured the security of the customer's account,"" a Vodafone spokesperson said.  If you're worried about criminals stealing your cellphone number, De Vere suggests calling your operator and asking for additional security measures such as a PIN or password to be requested when calling support agents. Otherwise, better solutions are in the hands of the operators.  ""They've got the methods there, they've got the tools, they've got the passwords, they've got the ability to do it,"" he told me. ""But day to day, they're just not doing it.""

2017-05-31 16:22:00,2017,5.0,31,"One Nation, Ostracized"," It is being widely reported that the United States will pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement, the largest and most important international treaty to mitigate the effects of climate change. If these reports are correct, Donald Trump will have unilaterally pushed the United States into a new age of isolationism.  Experts who worked on the Paris agreement and in the State Department under President Obama are quick to point out that the treaty isn't merely designed to protect the environment: It's one of the more important works of diplomacy the international community has ever worked on, a method the United States and others used to find common ground with countries that have traditionally had fraught relations.  ""There has been a lot of trust built between the US and other countries because of the progress we've made on climate agreements,"" Jessica Brown, former Foreign Affairs Officer and lead climate finance negotiator at the State Department, told me in December.   In November 2015, as world leaders were meeting to fine-tune the details of the agreement, President Obama's White House was quick to say that America was working closely ""with countries as varied as Brazil and India,"" noted that ""cooperation with China is absolutely essential,"" and said that Paris climate talks with France and Germany segued into international collaboration to fight ISIS.   ""This is not first and foremost about saving the environment for its own sake,"" Paul Bodnar, who helped negotiate the treaty and is now a senior fellow at the Rocky Mountain Institute, told me. ""It's about protecting our economic and security interests around the world. If you support food security, global health, poverty eradication, you should be very concerned about how climate change works to counteract those goals.""  The idea here is that, with climate, the US has been able to find areas of common ground with countries like China that have segued into greater diplomatic cooperation.   ""We saw positive knock-on effects from our leadership on climate on other areas,"" Bodnar said. ""In China, it has been one of the bright spots of the relationship and has made it easier to maintain that a vital, bilateral relationship, which is one of the most important in the world at a time when there's been a lot of friction."" ""To forfeit areas of mutual benefit with China unilaterally and voluntarily seems like the wrong thing … to be doing at this time,"" Pete Ogden, who studies climate policy at the Center for American Progress and formerly worked at the State Department and in the White House, told me soon after Trump was elected.  Even though Trump has not yet officially announced that the US will leave the Paris accord, his rhetoric on climate, NATO, and international trade deals during his campaign and in the past year have made the global community feel obligated to forge ahead without America's leadership.   Earlier this year, French President-elect Emmanuel Macron appealed directly to ""American researchers, entrepreneurs, and engineers working on climate change: … Please, come to France, you are welcome."" Last week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said ""the times in which we could rely fully on others—they are somewhat over … we have to know that we must fight for our future on our own."" In New York Tuesday, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said ""it is absolutely essential that the world implements the Paris Agreement—and that we fulfill that duty with increased ambition."" Last week, Macron compared Trump to Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Russian and Turkish strongmen leaders who are known to break from the broader international community on world affairs.  If America leaves the Paris Agreement, it will be abandoning an agreement signed by quite literally every nation in the world save for Nicaragua and war-torn Syria. We will be alone.   Isolationism and an ""America First"" ideology is what Trump campaigned on, and so it's not surprising that the United States has pursued these policies of self-ostracization. But the Trump administration is swimming upstream against a world that is united. As the world goes one way, America heads another. It is not just the environment that Trump is sacrificing; he is also throwing out any goodwill and influence America has earned as a result of international cooperation and collaboration.

Increased marketing costs meant adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization were flat at 8.6 million euros ($10.2 million) in the third quarter, although sales rose 41 percent from a year ago to 70.7 million euros. “Costs were surprisingly big but also the number of paying customers lagged expectations,” Hannu Rauhala, an analyst at OP Equities, who has a “buy” rating on Rovio, said. Rovio which was listed on the Helsinki bourse in September saw its shares drop to 9.64 euros at 0837 GMT, a fall of nearly 19 percent and well below its IPO price of 11.50 euros. “The company has changed a lot in the past years and it is considered as a growth company. The stock is strongly driven by growth expectations,” Rauhala said. Rovio saw rapid growth after the 2009 launch of the original “Angry Birds” game, but it plunged to an operating loss and cut a third of its staff in 2015 due to a pick up in competition and a shift among consumers to freely available games. Rovio’s game titles now include “Angry Birds 2,” “Angry Birds Blast”, “Angry Birds Friends” and “Battle Bay.” Reporting by Jussi Rosendahl; editing by Gwladys Fouche and Alexander Smith",https://www.reuters.com/article/rovio-results/update-1-flat-profit-gives-angry-birds-makers-shares-the-blues-idUSL8N1NT1F1,Technology News,Reuters,technology,234
2016-10-10 00:00:00,2016,10.0,10,"Divorced, deceased parents linked to kids' smoking and drinking "," (CNN)We know that parents have a profound influence on their child's life, and increasingly, scientific research is connecting the dots between attention or neglect and behavior. Children who experience the loss of a father or mother early in life are more likely to smoke and drink before they hit their teens, a new study of English families found. This association between parental absence and risky behavior in childhood occurred no matter whether the cause was death, separation or divorce.  In fact, preteens with an absent parent were more than twice as likely to smoke and drink, the researchers discovered. They defined parental absence as the loss of a biological parent before a child reached age 7. ""We know from previous research that people may take up risky health behaviors as a coping strategy or as a form of self-medication, to help them cope with stressful situations,"" noted Rebecca Lacey, an author of the study and a senior research associate at University College London. Possible evidence of the link between parental absence and behavior comes from an unlikely source from across the pond: President Obama. In a new MTV documentary, ""Prescription for Change: Ending America's Opioid Crisis,"" Obama reveals his past drug use: ""When I was a teenager, I used drugs, I drank, I pretty much tried whatever was out there, but I was in Hawaii, and it was a pretty relaxed place. I was lucky that I did not get addicted except to cigarettes, which took me a long time to kick.""  Notably, Obama's parents divorced around his 3rd birthday, within the parental absence time frame defined by Lacey and her colleagues. Based on her findings, Lacey says, early life assistance provided to children with an absent parent may help prevent substance use, which might set a pattern and lead to poor fitness later in life.  ""Health behaviors established earlier in life are known to track into adulthood,"" Lacey and her co-authors wrote in their study, published Monday in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood. Thousands of children studied over time The research team examined data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, which records health data for thousands of children born between 2000 and 2002. Among the goals of the study is to collect information on fathers' involvement in children's care and development. After a first survey of the children at 9 months old, surveys collected information for each child at ages 3, 5, 7 and 11 years old. Overall, the researchers examined the records of nearly 11,000 children. Of these thousands of children, more than a quarter had experienced the absence of a biological parent by age 7. During their age-11 survey, the children were asked whether they had ever smoked cigarettes or drunk alcohol. Those who had tried booze also answered whether they'd had enough to feel drunk. The results to the smoking question would soothe the nerves of most parents: The overwhelming majority of preteens said they had not smoked. However, 11-year-old boys were more likely than girls to have tried cigarettes: 3.6% versus 1.9%. Drinking was much more common among the 11-year-olds. Here again, the boys outnumbered the girls, with one in seven boys reporting that they'd tried alcohol, compared with one in 10 of the girls. Of the preteens who tried drinking, nearly twice as many boys (12%) said they'd had enough to feel drunk, compared with slightly less than 7% of the girls. Lacey and her colleagues calculated that preteens who had experienced parental absence before the age of 7 were more than twice as likely to have taken up smoking and 46% more likely to have started drinking. Although the boys were more likely to have reported smoking or drinking, they weren't any more likely than girls to have reported smoking or drinking as a consequence of parental absence, explained Lacey.  Is death more significant than divorce? One interesting datapoint in the study showed that kids whose parent had died were less likely to have tried alcohol by the age of 11; however, those who had tried it were more than 12 times as likely to get drunk than kids with absent parents due to separation or divorce.  ""We need to be a little bit cautious about overinterpreting this result,"" Lacey said, since the sample population contained very few children who had experienced parental death.  Overall, Lacey and her colleagues believe that a range of factors -- including less parental supervision and unhealthy coping mechanisms on the part of the kids -- may contribute to the association between parental absence and risk behaviors. Mitch Prinstein, a professor and the director of clinical psychology at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, believes the study covers ""an extraordinarily important topic.""  ""The rate of health risk behaviors like smoking and consumption of alcohol is a serious concern, not just in the UK but in many nations, especially here in the US,"" said Prinstein, who was not an author of the study. Prinstein added that anything to help us understand which kids are at risk at the earliest age ""deserves our attention."" Other adults can make a difference Though it's ""exciting,"" Prinstein noted that the study had one weakness in that the researchers could not control for factors such as parental depression or physical illness. As a result, no one can say whether a parent's absence was the cause of a child's risky behavior or whether other factors, such as a parent's depression, might have played a more direct role. ""All studies have limitations, of course, so this is not to suggest this (research) is not an important contribution,"" he said, adding that previous research suggests parental neglect can be a factor leading to risky behavior in children. Though the study focuses on children in the UK, Prinstein also believes the results ""might not be culturally bound"" and so probably apply to American families. Still, Prinstein cautions against misinterpreting the results since past studies revealed that ""aunts, uncles, grandparents, coaches, members of the neighborhood community can serve a very important role for kids.""  Someone who is not in the ""formal role of a parent"" can still have a ""dramatic"" and positive influence in the life of a child, he said, and they may even help a child resist peers who have begun to experiment with substances.  Prinstein concluded, ""I would hate for anyone to feel stigmatized that what they're providing for a child is not OK if they are offering that child access to other adults, like grandparents and aunts and uncles -- because we know that is very helpful.""

2017-09-20 16:25:04,2017,9.0,20,Avoiding Cameras While Training the Lens on Food,"Tech We’re Using How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Pete Wells, The Times’s restaurant critic, discussed the tech he is using. How has tech transformed the world of dining? There are lots of incremental, behind-the-scenes changes that affect restaurants more than consumers, such as more sophisticated reservation systems and point-of-sale software, but I think the most powerful, sweeping change has come from digital photography hooked up to the internet. Photography is now the main way we communicate about restaurant cooking. As a word guy I hate to say this, but it’s true. I wrote an essay about this a few years ago, when the outlines of the new world were just coming into view, and it’s much more clear now. At the time, restaurant designers were just starting to think about lighting the dining room so people could take better pictures for Instagram. Now they talk openly about it, and you see it everywhere. It’s the thing that killed off the last trend in lighting, those amber-colored dangling Edison bulbs. Now everybody is installing pin spots in the ceiling pointing straight down at the table, which is why you see all these very sharp and high-contrast pictures of plates on Instagram. The restaurants are doing this because it’s largely free marketing. (Some Instagrammers are so popular that restaurants will invite them in for a comped meal, so it’s not entirely free.) I was told that one major restaurant publicity firm in New York has a full-time employee who does nothing but help restaurants with Instagram. This solves one of the main problems that restaurants used to have in the days when “old” media was the only game in town: How do you keep people talking about your place after the initial buzz dies down? Besides the marketing, there are creative implications. For one thing, chefs are much more focused now on sending out food that photographs well. So I end up eating a lot of flowers and leaves that don’t really taste like much but make the plate more colorful, because most cooked food is brown. Ditto all the boards and slates and rocks that are being asked to stand in for plates. It has also sped up the rate at which ideas about food travel from one place to another. Chefs don’t just use photography for marketing. They are also documenting their work for their peers; you see this in the way René Redzepi in Copenhagen uses Instagram. It’s one reason his style has spread around the world in the span of just a few years. And how has it changed the way you do your job? What are the pros and cons? The best thing about having everybody take pictures of food is that I can do it without giving myself away. I used to be really self-conscious when I took out my phone; I’d run to the restroom and take surreptitious notes in the stall. Now I just snap away all night long, and I look like everybody else. And photography is the first stage of my note-taking now. After I get home I reconstruct my impressions of the meal, starting with my pictures of my food and the menu. When I started this job, a former critic advised me to steal menus when I could get away with it, and that’s completely unnecessary now. What’s your opinion on Yelp, where everyone is a wannabe food critic? I probably look at Yelp more than some other critics because I’m convinced there’s valuable information in there. The hard part is extracting it from all the useless stuff, which is what most people in food media see when they look at Yelp. The basic problem is that Yelp was built to reward frequent posting rather than knowledge or insight or expertise. And yet there are people on Yelp who know a lot about food and eat around and have a pretty solid basis for comparison. I find that Yelp is most useful with Korean, Chinese and Japanese food, because, for a number of reasons, there tend to be a lot of Yelpers who know those cuisines pretty well. How do you feel about delivery apps like Instacart, Caviar or UberEats? Do you use them much? I don’t. I almost never eat at home, and when I do, I want to cook. I did use Caviar in the context of a restaurant review a few weeks ago and was pretty happy with how well it worked. Sites like Yelp give people plenty of information about restaurants. Yet many restaurants still have their own websites. Is this necessary? The most valuable thing a restaurant can do on its website is post the current menu and drinks lists, with prices. All the other data you might want, and there’s not really very much, can be served up much more efficiently by Google, although I still think website designers who don’t put the restaurant’s address and phone number and hours right on the home page should be sued for malpractice. As our food critic, you have to stay unrecognized when you try new restaurants. How do you do that in an era that demands us to sacrifice privacy on the internet? This isn’t a major issue. People are always surprised when I say that, but it’s one of the things that has been least affected by technology. Before we had digital photographs, restaurants would get their hands on some old head shot of the critic from a book jacket or something — Ruth Reichl, William Grimes and Frank Bruni had all written books before they were restaurant critics — and then photocopy it and share it with all their friends in the business. I remember, in the 1990s, a friend who worked as a waiter showing me a picture of Ruth, who was the critic at the time. It was probably a 15th-generation photocopy, but you could still recognize her. Now the fidelity and resolution are higher, but the picture of me that most restaurants seem to have on their wall is about 10 years old. There are a few more recent shots, taken across a dining room while I was eating, that are in circulation, but they’re pretty terrible. My friends know they’re not supposed to put pictures of me on Facebook. I don’t take selfies, but I probably wouldn’t be a selfie guy even if I had another job. Most of the time when I’m recognized it’s because somebody is working in that restaurant who waited on me in another place I’ve reviewed. I don’t get caught by technology; I get caught by human memory. It’s sort of reassuring, I guess.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/technology/personaltech/what-technology-pete-wells-uses.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,1120

2018-08-12 18:25:00,2018,8.0,12,Paris Jackson Had Surgery for Golf Ball-Sized Abscess,"Paris Jackson underwent surgery on Friday to remove an abscess — and despite the pain, she was onstage the next day to perform with her new band, The Soundflowers. “So long story short, I had surgery yesterday,” the 20-year-old daughter of Michael Jackson said on Saturday, in a video posted on her band’s Instagram story. Continuing, she said that she had “an abscess that was almost the size of a golf ball.” She told her followers that if an abscess pops, “you can go septic and die.” “But I didn’t die,” she assured the group’s followers. “They operated immediately.” An abscess is a “pocket of pus” that can occur “almost anywhere” in the body, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Jackson went on to share that while doctors told her she probably should have been under anesthesia for the procedure, she declined and “was awake for all of it.” “It was definitely the most pain that I’ve ever been through in my entire life,” she remarked, adding that since she’s “covered head-to-toe in tattoos,” that’s really saying something. After updating her fans on her health, Jackson gushed over how exciting it was to perform with the band that day at Canyon Sessions, a fundraiser for the organization F— Cancer. “We played a show today, and we didn’t completely suck, and my f—ing grandma was there, and I’m so relieved that she didn’t hate it, that she actually liked it. And, I don’t know, that means the world to me,” she added. Continuing, she remarked: “Also sorry if i sound weird, I’m on a lot of meds right now to kind of get me through the pain of the procedure. I shouldn’t have even left bed today.” In a separate post shared on her own Instagram account, Jackson explained just how important it was that Katherine Jackson, the 88-year-old Jackson family matriarch, was there to watch. “I can’t believe my grandma made it to our second live show ever. and she actually liked it!?!!! i was s—ing my pants,” she wrote. “i love you so much grandma. i’m so happy we got to play for you and to play for such an incredible cause.” In the accompanying photos, Paris held her grandmother’s hand while kissing her cheek and nuzzling against her forehead. Katherine raised Paris and her brothers, Prince Jackson, 21, and Blanket — who now goes by B.G. — 16, after Michael’s death in 2009.

2020-02-25 18:27:12,2020,2.0,25,Mallinckrodt Reaches $1.6 Billion Deal to Settle Opioid Lawsuits,"The company sold more opioids in the U.S. than any other manufacturer during the height of the addiction crisis, prosecutors have said. Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, the largest generic opioid manufacturer in the United States, has tentatively agreed to pay $1.6 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits brought by state and local governments over its role in the opioid crisis. The agreement was endorsed by 47 states and U.S. territories along with a committee of lawyers representing thousands of cities and counties, the company said on Tuesday. The money, to be paid into a cash trust over eight years, will be used to underwrite the costs of opioid addiction treatments and related efforts across the country. “Nothing can undo the devastating loss and grief inflicted by the opioid epidemic upon victims and their families, but this settlement with Mallinckrodt is an important step in the process of healing our communities,” Attorney General Xavier Becerra of California said in a statement announcing the agreement. “Our office has worked aggressively to hold accountable bad actors who fueled this public health crisis.” Under the terms of the agreement, the United States division of Mallinckrodt that produces generic opioids would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. After a bankruptcy judge approves the restructuring plan, an initial payment of $300 million would be disbursed to plaintiffs to alleviate the opioid crisis, with the remaining $1.3 billion to be paid out over eight years. Other divisions of the company, which has its headquarters abroad and also produces branded drugs, are not filing for bankruptcy. Mallinckrodt is the first opioid company to reach even a tentative national settlement agreement with municipal governments and most of the states. Offers from other defendants — like Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, which, like Mallinckrodt, is now also seeking to restructure in bankruptcy court, and from the health and consumer products giant Johnson & Johnson and huge drug distributors like McKesson — have yet to be accepted by an overwhelming majority of plaintiffs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that from 1999 to 2017, almost 218,000 people died in the United States from overdoses related to prescription opioids. The opioid-related deaths were five times higher in 2017 than they were in 1999, according to the C.D.C. In a statement, Paul T. Farrell Jr., Paul J. Hanly Jr. and Joe Rice, lawyers who are negotiators on behalf of thousands of cities and counties suing the company in federal courts, said that though they had agreed to the deal in principle, they were still working out the details. “Our pursuit of corporate accountability against a host of other defendants across the entire drug supply chain will not stop,” the lawyers said. New York is one of the few states that have not yet confirmed acceptance of the Mallinckrodt offer. Its trial, which is being joined by Suffolk and Nassau Counties, against a cluster of pharmaceutical industry defendants, including Mallinckrodt, is set to begin on March 20. In a statement, Letitia James, the New York attorney general, said: “While we continue to work with other states and creditors to ensure that any proposal involving Mallinckrodt serves the interests of our communities and that money can flow to our communities for remediation as quickly as possible, we have yet to reach a final agreement with the company on all terms of a New York settlement. Unless that happens, we are determined to press ahead with the trial against the company next month.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/health/mallinckrodt-opioid-settlement.html,health,The New York Times,health,577
2018-08-07 18:47:00,2018,8.0,7,"For Many College Students, Hunger Can ‘Make It Hard To Focus In Class’","As students enter college this fall, many will hunger for more than knowledge. Up to half of college students report that they were either not getting enough to eat or were worried about it, according to published studies. “Food insecurity,” as it’s called, is most prevalent at community colleges, but it’s common at public and private four-year schools as well. Student activists and advocates in the education community have drawn attention to the problem in recent years, and the food pantries that have sprung up at hundreds of schools are perhaps the most visible sign. Some schools are also using the Swipe Out Hunger program, which allows students to donate their unused meal plan vouchers, or swipes, to other students to use at campus dining halls or food pantries. Those “free dining passes have given me chances to eat when I thought I wouldn’t be able to,” one student wrote to the program. “I used to go hungry and that would make it hard to focus in class or study. [The passes] really helped my studying and may have helped me get my GPA up.” Pantries and food passes are good band-aids, but more system-wide solutions are needed, advocates say. “If I’m sending my kid to college, I want more than a food pantry,” says Sara Goldrick-Rab, professor of higher education policy and sociology at Temple University in Philadelphia, who founded the Hope Center for College, Community and Justice. “I want to know that they’re addressing high food prices on campus and taking steps to ensure no student goes hungry.” Part of the disconnect may stem from a misperception about what today’s students are really like, says Katharine Broton, an assistant professor in educational policy and leadership studies at the University of Iowa who has published research on food and housing insecurity in colleges. Many of them don’t fit the profile of a “typical” student who attends a four-year institution full time and doesn’t have a job, Broton says. Rather, about 40 percent of students today are working in addition to going to school, and nearly 1 in 4 are parents. The juggling act can be hard to maintain. “Most of the students, we find, are working and receiving financial aid, but still struggling with food insecurity,” Broton says. Watch More from VICE Impact: Adding to the stress is the fact that while tuition and fees continue to rise, financial aid hasn’t kept pace. In the 2017-18 school year, after accounting for grant aid and tax benefits, full-time students at two-year colleges had to cover $8,070 in room and board on average, while those at four-year public institutions faced an average $14,940 in room, board, tuition and fees. Anti-hunger advocates credit students with both sounding the alarm about hunger on campus and in some cases offering ingenious solutions. Rachel Sumekh, who founded the Swipe Out Hunger program with friends at UCLA several years ago, says they wanted to do something useful with the unused credits from the meal plans that they were required to buy. The program now counts 48 schools as participants, and Sumekh says in the past year they’ve seen a “dramatic” increase in the number of colleges that are reaching out to them about getting involved. The University of California-Berkeley is part of Swipes, as the program is known. It’s one element in a multipronged effort that targets students who may need extra support to meet their basic housing, food and other needs, says Ruben Canedo, a university employee who chairs the campus’s basic needs committee. (He also co-chairs a similar committee for all 10 UC campuses.) According to a survey of Berkeley students, 38 percent of undergraduates and 23 percent of graduate students deal with food insecurity at some point during the academic year, Canedo says. The school targets particular types of students, including those who are first-generation college-goers, parents, low-income or LGBT. Canedo says a key focus this fall will be to enroll eligible students in CalFresh, the California version of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps. Under federal rules, students generally must work at least 20 hours a week to qualify for SNAP, something many cannot manage. But states have flexibility to designate what counts as employment and training programs, says Elizabeth Lower-Basch, director of income and work supports at CLASP, an anti-poverty advocacy organization. In California, for example, students who participate in certain educational programs at school are eligible for CalFresh. “That’s our first line of defense,” Canedo says. “Students are being awarded about $192 per month.” For students who don’t qualify for CalFresh, the school sponsors a parallel food assistance program that also provides benefits. There’s a food pantry that offers regular cooking demonstrations. But what Canedo says he’s particularly proud of is a 15-week nutritional science course that students can take that teaches them about healthy eating, prepping food, budgeting and grocery shopping, among other things. Some of those skills can help students learn to manage their money and food to get them through their time at school without running short.

2017-12-19 18:57:00,2017,12.0,19,"The YouTuber Who Is Redefining Renewable Energy
"," Jehu Garcia didn’t expect to be known for working with Lithium-ion batteries. The California-based YouTuber previously started a photography accessories company, and originally thought his life was more about cameras and making videos. “I didn’t want to be known as the battery guy,” Garcia told me on a recent phone call.  But then, in 2015, Elon Musk unveiled the Tesla Powerwall. The suitcase-sized battery lets homeowners store electricity, either from the grid or solar panels. The device represented an impressive step forward in alternative energy technology, but it started at $3,000 and could only store 10 KWh of electricity, or about a third the average American household consumes in a day.  Inspired by Tesla, battery hobbyists started building their own DIY powerwalls using recycled laptop batteries and hooking them up to solar panels for a fraction of the cost. They turned to YouTube, Facebook, and dedicated online forums to swap techniques and find out where to buy supplies. Garcia, via his instructional YouTube videos, quickly became one of the most respected and influential DIY powerwall enthusiasts on the internet.  Two years before the Powerwall was released, Garcia converted a vintage Volkswagen bus to run on an electric battery instead of gasoline. He was also already a fan of Tesla, and knew a little about Lithium-ion batteries, which are used in everything from cellphones and laptops to Powerwalls. So he started making videos teaching others how to build their own alternative and recycled energy source.  Garcia quickly became popular, and his videos started garnering tens of thousands of views. He began to not only teach people how to build batteries, but also to secure lots of 18650 cells—the kind needed to make DIY powerwalls—to distribute to his audience.   Garcia ultimately isn’t just another YouTuber in it for the views, he has become a community leader dedicated to changing how we all think about energy. He aims to prove to the world that you don’t need a corporation or nonprofit to help you go off the grid, you can do it yourself.  In October, I visited Garcia at his modest home in the sleepy suburb of Rancho Cucamonga, about an hour outside of Los Angeles. Next to his garage, he has built himself a makeshift studio, where he often works with batteries and films his YouTube videos.   Garcia doesn’t have any formal training, and hasn’t ever taken a professional engineering class. He was brought over the border from Mexico as a child, and never attended college. But he uses his unusual background to his advantage, because he’s far easier to relate to than a tech executive or professional engineer. If Garcia can build a DIY powerwall, you can too.   With over 140,000 YouTube subscribers, Garcia is dedicated to making videos full time, and has big plans for the future. When I first wrote about DIY powerwall builders in August, he told me he was planning to one day build one of the biggest privately owned sources of power in the US. The giant battery system will be able to store 1 megawatt of power, or 1000 kWh, Garcia says. “We’re going to power a recycling facility,” he told me at the time.  Last month, Garcia traveled to a place that could perhaps use alternative sources of energy more than anywhere else: Puerto Rico. In September, the US territory was devastated by Hurricane Maria, a category 5 storm that destroyed crucial infrastructure on the island and killed hundreds of people.   Garcia says he raised between $30,000 and $40,000 via donations to bring small powerwalls and solar panels to over 30 families so far without power on the island. The majority of Puerto Rico’s 3.4 million residents are believed to still be without electricity, nearly three months after the storm hit shore.   Where many people might see in Puerto Rico only a humanitarian crisis, Garcia sees a bright future powered by alternative energy. “I think it’s an opportunity much more than a tragedy,” he said, referring to the island’s power crisis.   He thinks if people witness solar panels and recycled batteries working on the island, they’ll be more willing to invest in the technology elsewhere. “I think if people see it, if industry sees it, it’s going to be the first part of the US where the future starts.”    Humans of the Year is a series about the people building a better future for everyone.

2016-05-09 00:00:00,2016,5.0,9,2016 election: Too young to vote but not too young to ...,"Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv.   (CNN)Aditya Deo is the only senior at his New Jersey high school who won't be 18 before Election Day, which means he'll be the only one among his graduating class who can't vote during one of the most unpredictable and entertaining campaigns in modern history.  He told me he's sad he won't be able to cast a ballot in 2016 but happy, too. ""Happy because it's not really a great selection this year, in my opinion,"" said Deo, a senior at James Caldwell High School in West Caldwell, New Jersey. ""I don't think that any of (the candidates) are that good for the future of America."" While Deo and many other teens can't officially weigh in this year on the future of the presidency, they have no shortage of opinions about the candidates, the issues and what they want the next president to focus on over the next four years. To find out more of what teens are thinking, we gave more than a dozen students at James Caldwell High School a homework assignment. We asked them to finish this sentence and post their responses on social media: I'm #tooyoungtovote, but I'm not too young to _____. Their answers speak volumes about the tone and tenor of the presidential campaign and the issues that are top of mind for these young millennials. Ashvin Nagarajan, 16, said he's not too young to want ""a moderate president who will get bipartisan support and unite a divided country."" I chided the sophomore: Is that even possible? ""Honestly, sometimes it doesn't seem like it,"" he told me in the orchestra room at his school. Sixteen-year-old Jenna Martinez also targeted the partisanship in our current politics. ""I may be #tooyoungtovote but I know that the election is more about pushing party agendas than being flexible to benefit the nation,"" the junior wrote on Twitter. ""The parties themselves have become so rigid in their belief system,"" she said. ""A lot of people ... identify as a certain party and just blindly follow what that party dictates ... rather than taking the opportunity to really educate themselves and make a decision for themselves."" Kassie Sarkar, 17, wrote about how ""our nation, so fervently indivisible, suffers from a glaring divide which only competency can mend."" The country needs someone who can heal that divide in our country, she said. ""I think that we need to have someone who is going to be able to close that disconnect between people and just bring our country together so we can be stronger and more united."" What's truly needed is leadership, said Thomas Salandra, 17. He may be too young to vote, but he's not too young to ""realize our country is sinking and that we desperately need a leader who is willing and able to fix it."" President Barack Obama has not been able to do enough, he said. ""I feel that over the past seven years, we've had a president who's been dividing us and who's trying, desperately he's trying himself to fix the country, but I don't think it's working."" A number of students brought up concerns about some of the anti-immigrant rhetoric during the campaign, including Donald Trump's desire to build a wall on the southern border of the country and his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. ""I may be #tooyoungtovote but I am not too young to recognize prejudice and bigotry when it threatens our nation,"" wrote Emily Freed, 17, a junior. Megan West, also 17 and a junior, added, ""Donald Trump, in particular, is very outspoken in his racism toward Mexican people and people of the Islamic faith (and) women. I find it appalling."" In response to his classmates' concerns about prejudice and discrimination, Mark Javornik wrote that while he may be too young to vote, he's not too young to ""realize that not every criticism of a fundamentally flawed ideology is bigotry."" The 16-year-old junior says he considers himself to be an independent who leans more toward the left but is frustrated by the unwillingness of candidates, namely Democrats, he says, to criticize parts of the Islamic ideology that he believes may have contributed to terrorism in Paris, Brussels and San Bernardino, California, over the past several months. ""You are always going to have some bigotry, but people need to realize that you can criticize the ideology without being bigoted,"" he said. ""If you say something indiscriminately about all Muslim people, that's obviously bigoted, but if you say something that's flawed in the culture that they believe in and their religion, I see nothing bigoted in that. ... We are never going to be able to come to a solution about Islamic terror unless we lay all of the issues down on the table and recognize them."" Terrorism and the security of the United States are deeply personal issues for 16-year-old Ava Caravela, a sophomore whose uncle died in the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. She wrote that she may be too young to vote, but she's not too young to care about the nation's security and the way our veterans are treated. ""I just don't understand how someone could be going to work one day and then not return home to his 3-month-old child,"" she said. ""And I just think we need to focus more on our nation's security because that shouldn't have happened."" Other issues the teens raised included climate change, the cost of college and women's rights. ""I feel that as a woman, I should be able to make my own decisions about my own body. I shouldn't have the government controlling what I do with my own body,"" said Rachael Weisman, 17, who wrote, in part, that she's not too young to worry about her future as a woman. Oliver King, also 17, said he may be too young to vote, but he's not too young to understand the issues affecting our country and make informed decisions about what he thinks is best. Too often, he said many adults, especially older generations, don't realize this. ""It's almost become a stereotype that if some young person holds political views, especially left-wing, it's dismissed as being an edgy teenager, and you're not taken seriously,"" the junior said. His message to the candidates? ""We're the people who are going to be running the country soon, so you're going to have to start listening to us."" If you are ages 13-17, tell us the issues you care most about. Head to @CNNHealth on Twitter, get parent consent and finish this sentence: I'm #tooyoungtovote but not too young to ______________.

2017-01-24 15:24:00,2017,1.0,24,Australia Plans to Replace Passports with Facial Recognition,"Can't find your passport? In Australia, that may no longer be a problem at border control. The country is looking to replace passport checks with facial recognition technology. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Australia's Department of Immigration and Border Protection wants to introduce biometric facial or fingerprint recognition systems as part of Australia's Seamless Traveler initiative, aimed at automating and streamlining border control. The new system would also help officials more easily identify arrivals who are on watch lists, and it would be the latest in a push to use facial recognition software in airports across the world, such as in Washington, DC. Though the border officials don't have a particular system picked out yet, they can build on all the passenger data collected thus far: globally sourced and analyzed ticket information, travel history, criminal records, and more. The intelligence in the system can determine which passengers pose a risk, according to John Coyne, head of border security at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.  But the technology has its own biases. Facial recognition may seem like a seamless way to make airport security checks more efficient, but it isn't perfect. Facial recognition systems often struggle to identify non-white faces, and the systems are usually a handful of points away from 100 percent accurate.  Australian authorities have not settled on which specific system they want to use for the facial or fingerprint recognition, but a trial is planned at the airport in Canberra, Australia's capital, in July. The goal is to have the system in place by 2020 to automatically process 90 percent of travelers. Meanwhile, it's important to remember that the new system does not do away with passports entirely. Australians will still need their passports when they go abroad, while foreigners will still need them to leave.

2019-09-23 00:00:00,2019,9.0,23,"Amazon plans Alexa earbuds with fitness tracking, Echo with subwoofer","Amazon is developing a new pair of Alexa-powered wireless earbuds that double as a fitness-tracking device, CNBC has learned. The new earbuds, codenamed ""Puget,"" are expected to come with a built-in accelerometer and be able to monitor things like distance run, calories burned and pace of running, a person directly involved in the project said. Separately, Amazon is also working on a bulkier Echo device with better sound quality, this person said. It's unclear when these devices will be released. Amazon is expected to showcase a number of new products at its annual hardware event in Seattle on Wednesday. Amazon declined to comment on its plans. Both products would fit into Amazon's strategy to place its Alexa voice-assistant everywhere — in home and beyond. The new earbuds will give access to Alexa on the go, letting users talk to the voice assistant even in outdoor areas. The bulkier Echo, meanwhile, is designed to be the central speaker in Alexa's core home market, as it comes with a woofer and a higher-quality speaker than the original Echo. The Amazon earbuds will need an Apple or Android phone to use them, as they don't come with built-in cellular connectivity. The new earbuds are expected to be priced below $100, this person said, undercutting competing products from Apple or Bang & Olufsen. Amazon has traditionally priced its hardware devices below competitors, positioning them as more affordable products. Bloomberg previously reported on some aspects of Amazon's plans. The earbuds are particularly important for Amazon as they would mark the company's first foray into the health monitoring space. Amazon has shown signs of interest in the healthcare industry lately, building a team solely dedicated to ""health and wellness"" and hiring a number of healthcare experts. The move could also help Alexa become more personalized, as earbuds are usually used by one person. That means, if successful, the new wireless earbuds could open up a wide range of new opportunities for Alexa. For example, it could be used in grocery stores to promote certain products for individual users, or in obscure areas to give driving directions and restaurant recommendations. The broader goal for Amazon may be increased user engagement. While Alexa has been a smash hit success since its launch in 2014, its use case is still largely limited simple tasks, like playing music or asking about the weather. To make Alexa more ubiquitous, Amazon launched over a dozen new Alexa-enabled products at last year's hardware event, including a microwave, an in-car gadget, and a wall clock. Amazon is the clear leader in the burgeoning smart speaker space, owning roughly 70% of the market, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. But Google is quickly catching up, and is forecast to surpass Amazon's share by 2022, based on one estimate by Loup Ventures. In the wireless earbuds space, Apple's AirPods leads with 60% of the global market share, far-outpacing competitors like Jabra, Samsung, and Bose, according to Counterpoint Research. It's still unclear how exactly Amazon's hardware devices help the company's bottom line. While hardware devices are consistently the best-selling products on Amazon, the company does not disclose how much revenue they generate. It's also uncertain whether Amazon's hardware devices lead to more shopping on its site. Amazon SVP Dave Limp said in a June interview with CNBC that Alexa isn't necessarily used for more purchases yet, but said it is prompting users to buy more things online, such as music or audio book subscriptions.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/23/amazon-plans-alexa-earbuds-with-fitness-tracking-echo-with-subwoofer.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,577

Sampdoria, based in Genoa, said the players — Norwegian Morten Thorsby, Swede Albin Ekdal, Gambian Omar Colley and Italian Antonino La Gumina and team doctor Amedeo Baldari — were all doing well. “They are all in good health and in their homes in Genoa,” said the club in a statement. “Sampdoria reiterates that it has immediately applied all the procedures stipulated by the regulations: all club premises are closed, the team, managers and employees potentially involved are in voluntary home isolation,” it added. “Everything will go well. Together we will make it. Stay at home.” Thorsby, Ekdal and Colley have all been regulars this season while La Gumina has made one first-team appearance. Sampdoria’s last game was on Sunday against Verona who have gone into self-isolation. Fiorentina said that their Serbian striker Dusan Vlahovic had also tested positive. “He is at home and currently does not have any symptoms,” said the Florence-based club. Juventus defender Daniele Rugani and Sampdoria forward Manolo Gabbiadini tested positive earlier in the week.

2017-07-24 00:00:00,2017,7.0,24,Jimmy Kimmel re-enters health care debate with update on infant son ," (CNN)Jimmy Kimmel tweeted an update and adorable photo of his baby son on Friday, more than two months after opening up about his newborn's health on his late-night talk show. In doing so he also re-entered the health care debate.  ""Billy is 3 months old & doing great. Thx for the love & support,"" said Kimmel. ""Please remind your Congresspeople that every kid deserves the care he got."" Almost a week after his son's birth on April 21, Kimmel teared up during his monologue and revealed his newborn's congenital heart condition. ""He appeared to be a normal, happy baby, until about three hours after his birth,"" said Kimmel. ""A very attentive nurse at Cedars-Sinai Hospital"" noticed a heart murmur, ""which is common with newborn babies,"" Kimmel continued. ""But she also noticed he was a bit purple, which is not common.""   Doctors found that the newborn had a rare heart defect, known as tetralogy of fallot. In Billy's particular case, the pulmonary valve was blocked and there was a hole in the wall between the left and right sides of his heart, Kimmel said. Just three days after his birth, Billy underwent open-heart surgery at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. ""The operation was a success,"" said Kimmel. ""It was the longest three hours of my life."" He said that Billy will likely have to undergo more surgeries related to his heart condition throughout his life. Kimmel then transitioned his monologue to talk about health care, noting proposed cuts to the National Institutes of Health and negotiations happening among members of Congress. Kimmel said that, before Obamacare, he might not have been able to get health insurance for his son because Billy's heart defect would be considered a pre-existing condition.  ""If your baby is going to die and it doesn't have to, it shouldn't matter how much money you make,"" he said. ""I think that's something that whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on that, right?"" Reactions to Kimmel's emotional speech varied. Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer said President Trump shared Kimmel's concerns and wanted to make sure pre-existing conditions were covered under the Republican health care bill. Former President Barack Obama congratulated Kimmel and said the Affordable Care Act was built to protect children like Billy.  Other conservative lawmakers did not agree with Kimmel's stance. Former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh tweeted his disapproval: ""Sorry Jimmy Kimmel: your sad story doesn't obligate me or anybody else to pay for somebody else's health care."" Several conservative columnists also voiced their objection to Kimmel's remarks.  Now, over two months after Kimmel's monologue, the debate over health care continues in Washington.  Billy is doing well and his parents are still concerned about the future of health care. Molly McNearney, Kimmel's wife, also tweeted a hopeful update about her son last week.  ""Billy's looking out for a lot of his buddies at Children's Hospital,"" McNearney said in her post. ""Remind your Congresspeople to protect them.""

2018-04-30 00:00:00,2018,4.0,30,T-Mobile aborted deal for Straight Path casts light on Sprint merger,"An obscure wireless industry deal from last year can help explain why T-Mobile and Sprint finally agreed to merge this week after years of flirting with a deal. Last May, Verizon signed a deal to buy a company called Straight Path for more than $3 billion. If you remember the deal, it's probably because AT&T and Verizon battled back and forth for the company in an insane bidding war. After a series of bids and overbids, Verizon ended up paying $184 per share for Straight Path, which had been trading at around $30 per share. The merger was completed this February. Verizon and AT&T both wanted Straight Path for the rights it owned over certain parts of the wireless spectrum -- specifically, something called millimeter wave frequencies. The two largest U.S. wireless providers believe owning this spectrum will be helpful as they build out 5G wireless networks, which could provide speeds about 100 times faster than the current 4G networks. According to people familiar with the sale process, T-Mobile really wanted Straight Path too. But once it saw the bidding war break out between AT&T and Verizon, it decided it wasn't going to win and dropped out of the bidding. T-Mobile has a market capitalization of about $51 billion. AT&T and Verizon both have market caps of about $200 billion, and AT&T is trying to get even bigger with its $85 billion pending deal for Time Warner. Sprint's market valuation is about $22 billion, and it's 85 percent owned by Japanese tech giant SoftBank. ""We've looked at our spectrum positions and decided this was the right time to put these companies together,"" Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said in an interview Monday. The Federal Communications Commission is auctioning off two more bands of millimeter wave wireless spectrum this year -- 1.55 gigahertz of spectrum in two bands known as 24 GHz and 28 GHz. Straight Path showed Sprint and T-Mobile what to expect in these auctions -- as separate entities, they were going to have a very difficult time competing with Verizon and AT&T for 5G spectrum. But the financial firepower from a combined balance sheet could give them a chance to challenge the two largest wireless players. The Straight Path deal was one of the factors that pushed the companies to jump-start 2017 negotiations. Those negotiations ended up failing, but several things have happened in the past few months to bring SoftBank's Masayoshi Son back to the table. First, the two companies' stock prices settled, making the valuation of both companies more transparent. In a stock-for-stock merger, the stabilizing of the share prices, without as much premium built in from imminent M&A speculation, helped convince both sides of their relative values, said two people familiar with the deal. Second, both Sprint and T-Mobile now believe AT&T and Verizon could roll out 5G in select U.S. cities as soon as later this year. The 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea already debuted 5G technology, although handset technology won't bring 5G to the U.S. en masse until 2019. Third, the cable giants are coming: Comcast has entered the mobile market, and Charter is also working on a mobile service. While the cable companies use Verizon's network, they'll increasingly sell and market wireless services with existing TV, phone and broadband, creating a fully bundled product for customers. Comcast said earlier this year its Xfinity Mobile service already had 380,000 customers in less than a full year on the market. Back in February, T-Mobile CEO John Legere called Comcast's mobile service ""very irrelevant"" and said Charter's mobile service would be ""irrelevant squared."" ""The furthest thing from my mind is any concern about the impact of cable,"" Legere said. Expect his tune to change as Sprint and T-Mobile try to sell regulators on deal, which will hinge on whether the companies can truly compete in a 5G world. And while the two companies will argue about the importance of staying ahead of China on 5G development, the fact is no one really knows what 5G means. That could help Sprint and T-Mobile convince regulators they need to merge, if 5G is seen as the pot of gold on the other side of the rainbow. But it's also a convenient focus instead of the $43 billion in synergies that will come with a deal, which will almost certainly come with some job losses. Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/30/t-mobile-aborted-deal-for-straight-path-casts-light-on-sprint-merger.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,740
2017-01-09 00:00:00,2017,1.0,9,"In January, 'ex' marks the spot","This story was originally published on CNN.com in 2014.  (CNN)There was that distant-feeling New Year's kiss at midnight. Valentine's Day, a holiday based on setting hearts aflutter, was full of awkward pauses and glances over soufflé at the person you used to love.  Come March, it's time to turn over a new leaf. In recent years, January has earned the nickname ""Divorce Month"" -- a less appealing title than National Pet Month (May) or National Honey Month (September), though divorce can surely be both hairy and sticky. While marital psychologists and divorce lawyers say January's more accurate description would be ""I'm Starting to Research My Options Month,"" they agree there is some accuracy in the nomenclature. FindLaw.com's analysis of American divorce filings between 2008 and 2011, with legal research service Westlaw, revealed a spike in divorces in January, followed by a rise and peak in late March. The site's analysis also showed that searches for ""divorce"" and related phrases like ""family law"" and ""child custody"" jumped 50% from December to January, and continued to swell through March.  So, what exactly happens in those first three months of the year that makes seemingly happily wed couples join the estimated 40% of first marriages that end in divorce in the United States? ""People don't want to be accused by friends, family that they were heartless right before Christmas,"" said Miles Mason, a Memphis-based family and divorce lawyer. ""If somebody is coming to us in January, they made the decision to come see me or a lawyer before the holidays."" For some, it's all about the Benjamins. The end of the year means bonus season, a portion of which can be claimed as an asset from a spouse. Holding off until January will also not interfere with tax filings for the previous year, which most couples file jointly.  Mason says many are on the fence when they begin preliminary conversations with a lawyer. They want to know the basics: what it's going to cost, how much it will affect daily life and other practical concerns. He says people, especially heavy planners, want to have a holistic strategy in order to make smart legal and personal decisions. That's often why a client will begin the conversation in January and wait until March to actually file. ""Divorce is counterintuitive,"" he said. Mark Banschick, psychiatrist and author of ""The Intelligent Divorce"" series of books, calls the start of a new year an ""existential moment"" in that people look at their lives and realize that they go by too quickly and that their current version is not happy.  ""They call attorneys out of pain,"" he said.  Banschick says that just wanting a change isn't a good enough reason; it's easy to displace all the burden of your unhappiness on the spouse.  ""There's nobody that can hurt you like the person you love,"" he said. ""Because love is an opportunity to feel validated. But that vulnerability that allows somebody to acknowledge you is the same vulnerability that allows you to feel devastated."" The best time for divorce, according to him, is when you're feeling centered about who you are and what you need. Susan Pease Gadoua is the author of ""Contemplating Divorce, A Step-by-Step Guide to Deciding Whether to Stay or Go"" and a licensed therapist. She, like Banschick and Mason, also experiences an uptick in phone calls near the first of the year after folks white-knuckle it through the holidays. ""The problem with divorce is that there's never a good time,"" she said. But all three experts referenced another unlikely month for the same phenomenon: September. Banschick says it's because summertime is wedding and vacation season; the kids are home from school, and ""it's not a time to make troubles.""  The shared root of their conclusion:  This particular season of togetherness is over; now it's back to real life.

2017-11-30 00:00:00,2017,11.0,30,FDA aims to approve more drugs based on early clinical data,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is aiming to approve drugs based on very early data if the drug shows a possible benefit in terms of survival, the head of the agency told lawmakers at a hearing on Thursday. Speaking before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency would approve such drugs quickly and figure out later whether the benefit seen was real or coincidental. Gottlieb cited the FDA’s “accelerated approval” pathway as a potential blueprint. Accelerated approval allows the agency to approve drugs based on substitute measures of clinical benefit. For example, cancer drugs that cause tumors to shrink are considered likely to confer a meaningful clinical benefit, such as survival. The same principal could be applied to drugs which appear to increase survival in a small number of people, Gottlieb said. It could be determined later whether the benefit was statistically significant. “Even though the observed benefit, in this case, is on a clinical endpoint - an early look at survival - and not a surrogate measure of benefit, we believe using an accelerated approval approach often could be valuable.” He said the agency was also working on a proposal to more quickly approve cancer drugs for additional types of cancer. Currently, a company with a lung cancer drug would have to conduct randomized clinical trials comparing the drug to a placebo or comparator drug. The new proposal would allow approval in a second cancer based on a single arm study in which all patients receive the experimental treatment. He said the agency plans to issue guidance clarifying the circumstances in which such an approach would be appropriate.

2020-01-16 00:00:00,2020,1.0,16,Fiat Chrysler and Foxconn plan push into Chinese electric car market,"MILAN (Reuters) - Automaker Fiat Chrysler plans to set up a joint venture with the parent of iPhone assembler Foxconn to build electric cars and develop internet-connected vehicles in China, as it looks to make up ground in electric mobility. Fiat Chrysler (FCA) - which is set to launch its first full-electric model, the 500 small car, this year - last month reached a binding agreement for a $50 billion tie-up with France’s PSA to create the world’s No. 4 carmaker. The merger with PSA would help the Italian-American automaker to strengthen resources to meet tough new emissions rules and investments in electric mobility, where it has so far lagged its main competitors. FCA confirmed on Friday it was in talks with Hon Hai on the potential creation of a 50-50 joint venture to develop new generation battery electric vehicles and engage in the IoV, or ‘Internet of Vehicles’, business, with an initial focus on the Chinese market. FCA’s statement came after Taiwan’s Hon Hai - the parent of Foxconn - announced the potential joint venture in a separate statement. It “would enable the parties to bring together the capabilities of two established global leaders across the spectrum of automobile design, engineering and manufacturing and mobile software technology to focus on the growing battery electric vehicle market,” FCA said. Intesa Sanpaolo analyst Monica Bosio described the possible deal as “positive”, though it was not expected to have a significant impact on FCA fundamentals in 2020 and 2021. “It should help FCA and the future combined entity FCA-PSA to shorten its gap in the electric vehicles and in Asia,” Bosio said. In further evidence of how traditional carmakers are accelerating their electric push into the world’s largest auto market, Germany’s Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) is set to take a 20% stake in Chinese electric vehicle battery maker Guoxuan High-tech Co, two sources told Reuters. FCA said it was in the process of signing a preliminary agreement with Hon Hai, aiming to reach final binding agreements in the next few months. However, it added there was no assurance that final binding agreements would be reached or would be completed in that timeframe. With a share of China’s passenger car market of around 0.35%, FCA currently operates in the country through a loss-making joint venture with Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC). However, the joint venture does not produce electric models, raising doubts it could meet China’s tough emissions rules and green car quotas. FCA Chief Executive Mike Manley last year said the group had “streamlined” the structure of its Chinese partnership and appointed a new leadership to improve its competitiveness. Foxconn has been investing heavily in a variety of future transport ventures for several years, including Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride services giant, and Chinese electric vehicle start-ups Byton and Xpeng. Foxconn also has invested in Chinese battery giant CATL and a variety of other mostly Chinese transportation tech start-ups.

2020-03-19 00:00:00,2020,3.0,19,Airbnb is listening to investment pitches despite large cash,"Airbnb is fielding ""significant"" interest from investors even as the coronavirus crisis hits the travel and hospitality industry especially hard, two sources familiar with the matter told CNBC. Airbnb is in ""listen mode"" as it considers raising money during what it believes could be a good opportunity, one of the sources said. Another source said the company is in a position to weather the outbreak, but is in discussions to raise. The amount of a new funding round and a new valuation for Airbnb are still being discussed. Airbnb declined to comment. Airbnb already has plenty of funds with $3 billion in cash and $1 billion in credit, CNBC is told. The company has raised a total of $4.4 billion so far, according to Pitchbook. The company has seen interest from venture capitalists, private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds, according to the sources. Early Airbnb investor Ron Conway confirmed to CNBC that he's been referring calls to the company, including from several large and sophisticated investors. ""Those investors are calling me saying, I hope Airbnb is raising right now because if they are, I want a seat at the table,"" Conway told CNBC. ""A lot of them are ones that went through the dotcom crash with me back in 1999 and 2000. They're the same people who were very wise and invested in companies like Google, Amazon and Apple. They're saying, coming out of this downturn, it's going to be companies like Airbnb that will be huge huge market performers."" Conway said he didn't know what valuation the offers would be looking at or whether Airbnb will accept a new round of funds, though he said the extra cash could be used to help it out of the downturn. Conway said Airbnb is more ""nimble"" than other travel companies like Expedia and Booking and will be able to ""weather the storm."" ""I would highly expect that they would use some very good market technique to gain market share coming out of this,"" Conway said. ""Their growth rate was already much higher than their competitors. Now, everyone in the travel industry is reeling but Airbnb, with that management team, will be much more nimble coming out of this trauma."" A fundraising round for Airbnb would buck the trend of VC deals simmering down as the markets plunge on coronavirus fears. Investors told CNBC they predict fundraising rounds generally stalling and reaching less eye-popping valuations. One source said about a dozen ""high quality private companies"" are fielding interest from investors despite the turmoil in public markets. It's still unclear how a fundraising round could impact the company's plans to go public. Airbnb had said it planned to debut this year but the economic shift resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown that possibility in question again. CEO Brian Chesky told CNBC's Jim Cramer last year that the company was not in a rush to go public because ""We don't need to raise money."" Employees at Airbnb had put pressure on the company to go public as their valuable stock options are set to start expiring toward the end of the year, The New York Times previously reported. For the same reason, Airbnb could choose to pursue a direct listing over an initial public offering, meaning it would not need to sell new shares to public market investors. The company has not yet made a decision about an IPO or direct listing, according to one of the sources familiar with the situation. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are lead underwriters for the company. -CNBC's Laura Batchelor contributed to this report.

2017-06-22 14:00:00,2017,6.0,22,Depressed People See the World More Realistically," Feeling blue? Strangely, it might mean that you're actually better at judging your performance—and reality in general—than when you're not. It's called ""depressive realism,"" and it seems to suggest that in our normal state, we tend to operate under happy delusions that lift away when we're depressed. The idea blows apart the theory that depressed people have too negative an outlook on the world: They may actually just be seeing it how it is. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, depression is one of the most common mental illnesses in the United States, affecting over 16 million people (or about 6.7 percent of the population) in 2015. So does that mean that over 90 percent of the population is walking around with rose-colored glasses? Some research seems to suggest so. The concept of depressive realism first entered the scene via a 1979 paper published by L.B. Alloy and L.Y. Abramson. In it, the researchers presented both depressed and non-depressed participants with a button and a green light. They then asked the participants to figure out to what degree their responses (pushing the button) controlled that light. Depressed participants were much better at judging the degree of their control, while participants who weren't depressed tended to assume that they had more control over the light than they actually did. Depressive realism is ""still regarded as a fruitful hypothesis by many, but not all, psychologists,"" says Colin Feltham, professor emeritus of critical counseling studies at Sheffield Hallam University and author of the book Depressive Realism. A number of studies have investigated the theory with mixed results, he says. It may be tied to certain other psychological theories, like the terror management theory, Feltham says. Terror Management suggests that human nature is actually wired towards self-deception: In order to avoid facing terrifying concepts like death, most of us live in a state of self-delusion. And maybe, when we're depressed, we're just less likely to be deceived. More From Tonic: In fact, ""some psychologists concede that an element of self-deception may be necessary for well-being,"" Feltham says. Depressed people may just be lacking that crucial optimism that helps us power through a life full of heartache, meaninglessness, and death. So while they can see things more realistically, we all know that reality sometimes straight-up bites. The people most likely to experience depressive realism? Introverts, males, and people with high IQs, Feltham says, adding that it's most likely to occur in mildly depressed people—those suffering from major depression, by contrast, are more likely to suffer from larger distortions in their thinking. Not everybody is convinced of the effects of depressive realism as shown in literature, though. Psychologist Michael T. Moore, a professor at Adelphi University, led a survey of 75 studies on depressive realism that included over 7000 participants. His conclusion? ""There's certainly evidence for it, but the evidence that's there shows it occurs in a very narrow range of stimulus conditions,"" he says. ""A broken clock is going to be right twice a day."" Moore believes that it's not that depressed participants have a more accurate view of reality in general. Instead, the controlled experimental setup of many of the studies may have artificially led to such results. ""If you set up a circumstance where there's no relationship between the button and the light, depressed patients might be able to better pick that out, because that set of circumstances happens to conform to their somewhat biased view of the universe, that bad things happen for no reason,"" Moore explains. ""That doesn't necessarily mean that they're more accurate broadly, but under that very narrow set of stimulus conditions, they come out looking more accurate."" What we don't know, Moore emphasizes, is if depressed patients, across a broad range of human experiences, actually perceive the world more accurately. Our research is currently too homogenous, he says. Whether depressive realism is actually a widely applicable phenomenon is therefore still an open question, Moore says. But it's an important one, because it could have a major impact on how we both prevent and treat depression. The current leading treatment for depression is cognitive therapy, which operates under the assumption that the depressed patient is sad because he is misperceiving his environment, Moore says. That patient is only remembering negative things and failing to perceive the positive. Cognitive therapy presumably helps patients become more accurate and realistic—thus helping them get better. But if depressive realism proves to be true, it begs the question: Is cognitive therapy really helping patients see reality more accurately? Or is it just offering patients a set of rose-colored glasses? For now, the evidence suggests we have some reason to believe that mildly depressed individuals are better at perceiving certain aspects of reality. Whether that holds true for a wider set of circumstances remains to be seen. But in the meantime, enjoy those rose-colored glasses—they may just be a sign of sound mental health.

Earlier this week, Reuters reported that France is likely to delay its 5G spectrum auction until at least March 2020, three months later than originally scheduled. “The telecom operators are impatient, but we need clarification on which provider will be used, in order to go forward with our colossal investments in the long term,” Arthur Dreyfuss, head of the FFT French telecoms federation, told BFM Business. Dreyfuss also said that any plans to ban China’s Huawei from the future French 5G network could lead to even more delays. “If tomorrow, a network provider was banned, France would have another delay,” he said. France’s last spectrum auction in 2015 raised 2.8 billion euros ($3.10 billion) for state coffers. Under the current plan, the 5G frequency blocs up for grabs are within the 3.4-3.8 gigahertz bandwidth.

2016-07-28 00:00:00,2016,7.0,28,"New York pharmacy owner, husband plead guilty to large opioid pill scheme","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The owner of two New York City pharmacies and her husband pleaded guilty on Thursday to charges arising out of their roles in what authorities have called one of the largest opioid painkiller diversion schemes ever uncovered in the city. Lilian Jakacki, the pharmacies’ owner, and Marcin Jakacki, her husband, entered their pleas in Manhattan federal court, nine months after authorities arrested them amid efforts to combat the nation’s heroin and opioid drug epidemic. Both Jakackis, along with two corporate entities, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute narcotics. Lilian Jakacki, 50, also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit health care fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Prosecutors had accused the Jakackis of illegally distributing more than 500,000 pills of oxycodone, a heavily-regulated painkiller that has enormous cash value to drug dealers and is abused by over 13 million Americans annually. They ran the scheme out of two pharmacies in the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens called Chopin Chemists from 2010 to 2015, prosecutors said. They illegally distributed pills with a street value of $10 million to $15 million. During the scheme, the Brooklyn pharmacy for three years became the leading purchaser of oxycodone tablets in its zip code, which included two national chain stores, the indictment said. They used the proceeds of the scheme to, among other things, buy a $2 million home in Greenwich, Connecticut, prosecutors said. An audit in 2013 by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration found the Brooklyn pharmacy dispensed 430,000 pills without prescriptions, authorities said. Prosecutors said another 160,000 pills were diverted based on 1,300 fraudulent prescriptions, including ones in the name of luxury brands like “Chanel” or “Coach.” Thursday’s proceedings came a day after a guilty plea in the case was entered by Robert Cybulski, a Staten Island resident who prosecutors said was one of the largest pill purchasers. In court, Marcin Jakacki, 36, admitted to illegally selling 20,000 pills. Lilian Jakacki in her plea did not specify a number, but her plea agreement reflected the offense involved the equivalent of 100,000 30-milligram pills, according to a spokesman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.

2019-07-26 00:00:00,2019,7.0,26,U.S. lawmakers grill e-cigarette maker Juul over efforts targeted at schoolchildren,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - E-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc funded a “holistic health education” camp as part of efforts to market directly to school-aged children, members of a U.S. congressional panel said on Thursday, citing internal company documents. Democrats on a subcommittee of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform released a cache of internal Juul emails and other documents that committee staff described as early attempts to “enter schools and convey its messaging directly to teenage children.” Juul’s use of social media influencers to promote its vaping devices in the years after it launched in 2015 also came under scrutiny. James Monsees, Juul’s co-founder and chief product officer, told the committee that the company’s target audience from the beginning has been adult cigarette smokers. Among efforts cited in the Juul documents released were a $134,000 payment to set up a five-week “holistic health education” summer camp at a Maryland charter school, recruiting children from third through 12th grades, and offering $10,000 to schools using the company’s “youth prevention and education” programs for students, including those caught using e-cigarette products. “You don’t think that sounds strange at all?” Representative Katie Hill, a Democrat, asked Juul’s chief administrative officer, Ashley Gould. “All of these educational efforts were intended to keep youth from using the product,” Gould responded. When Juul realized how the school involvement could be perceived as negative, “we stopped the program,” she said. In a statement after the hearing, Juul said the $134,000 donation was to “facilitate already-existing community outreach and youth-prevention programs,” and said the company “did not have any direct interaction with the students.” Several committee members said Juul’s initiatives appeared similar to past efforts by the tobacco industry to reach young people under the guise of smoking prevention programs. Gould said Juul, which is 35 percent owned by Marlboro maker Altria Group Inc (MO.N), halted its program last year once it became aware of the tobacco industry’s past moves. Caleb Mintz, 17, a New York city high school student, testified at a separate hearing on Wednesday that a Juul representative came to his school as part of an educational program on mental health and addiction last year. He said in an interview Thursday that students received “mixed messages” about the product, being told it was safe but not to buy it. Mintz said after the hearing that the Juul presentation seemed to be “playing to the side of teens as rebellious. When a teen is told not to do something, they’re more likely to do it.” Members of the committee also quizzed Gould and Monsees over the use of social media influencers to promote Juul’s vaping devices. Company executives early on agreed that “younger consumers age 25 to 34 was going to be the target of our initial campaign,” Monsees said. “They would be more receptive to new technology solutions,” such as the Juul device. Amid an enormous uptick in teenage use of e-cigarettes in 2018 — a 78% increase among high school students from 2017 to 2018, according to federal data — Juul said it ended all social media advertising last fall. Juul also pulled many flavored nicotine pods, except mint, menthol and tobacco, from retail stores, which Monsees said represented more than half of the company’s sales at that time.

2018-10-27 05:00:04,2018,10.0,27,Why Textbooks May Need to Update What They Say About Birth Canals,"Trilobites A new study shows that the structure of the human pelvis varies between populations, which could have implications for how babies are birthed. Look up the term “pelvic canal” in the typical anatomy or obstetric textbook, and you likely will find a description such as this: “Well-built healthy women, who had a good diet during their childhood growth period, usually have a broad pelvis.” Such a pelvis, the text continues, enables “the least difficulty during childbirth.” But such characterizations have long been based on anatomical studies of people of European descent. In reality, the structure of the pelvic canal, the bony structure through which most of us enter the world, varies tremendously between populations, according to a new study in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. The findings have implications for how obstetricians treat patients of color, the authors say. In the United States, racial disparities in maternal health care are prevalent. Compounding factors like interpersonal and institutional racism, poverty, poor health care access and environmental burdens disproportionately harm black mothers. These contribute to the risk of pregnancy-related deaths being three to four times higher for black women than for white women. Limited prescriptions of what constitutes a “normal” pelvis or birthing process might lead doctors to perform unnecessary interventions — like induced labor, cesarean sections or the use of forceps — which can further exacerbate harm, said Lia Betti, an anthropologist at the University of Roehampton in London, and the study’s lead author. “What worries me is that doctors come out of school thinking of the European model of the pelvis,” Dr. Betti said. In the early 1900s, this led to “horrific situations” in which American doctors used forceps on black mothers, trying to force babies to align with “the rotation pattern for a European classical pelvis,” she added. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Modern humans have narrow pelvises compared to the size of babies’ heads. That discrepancy contributes to higher rates of birthing complications in humans than in other primates. Factors such as how long it takes a baby to progress through the canal, or which direction the head is facing on delivery, could change depending on pelvic shape. There is no accepted explanation for why the human pelvis leaves such little room for childbirth. Dr. Betti and her colleague Andrea Manica, of the University of Cambridge, set out to study a classic if highly-contested explanation known as the “obstetrical dilemma” hypothesis. The dilemma posits that as our species evolved and began walking upright, the width of the human pelvis narrowed, enabling the body’s weight to stay closer to its center of gravity. But as humans also developed bigger brains, it became harder for a fetus’s skull to squeeze through that tight channel. Dr. Betti is skeptical of this explanation, and thinks that other possibilities, such as modern diets or the need to support internal organs, could help explain the mismatch between pelvis and fetus. To explore the idea, she and Dr. Manica measured 348 skeletons from around the world. They found that pelvic shape varied enormously, even more than measures of leg, arm and general body proportion that are known to vary significantly between populations. That was “remarkable and unexpected,” the researchers wrote. Mostly, they found, pelvic shape varied along lines of geographic ancestry. People of sub-Saharan origin generally had the deepest pelvises back-to-front, while Native Americans had the widest side-to-side. Europeans, North Africans and Asians fell in the middle of the range. Birth-canal shape also varied markedly within populations, although the variation decreased the farther a population originated from Africa. That finding is consistent with others indicating that a population’s genetic diversity declines the farther it moves from the cradle of humankind Most of that variation in pelvic shape stemmed from random fluctuations in gene frequency, although natural selection seems to have played a minor role as well, Dr. Betti said. The top of the birth canal is slightly wider in populations from colder climates, perhaps to help make the body stockier. The variation observed by Dr. Betti suggests that pelvic shape is not so strictly controlled. And if pelvic shape is highly variable across populations, it’s likely “that the birthing process is also highly variable,” said Helen Kurki, an anthropology professor at the University of Victoria in Canada. These findings challenge the idea “that there is one ‘right’ way to birth a baby,” Dr. Kurki said, and suggest that a more individualized approach to childbirth might be better. Although people differ from one another anatomically, Dr. Betti said, her research suggests that those differences are not always functional. “If you look at the shape of the birth canal in different people, it could be tempting to think it’s adapted to give birth to babies with differently-shaped heads, or something like that,” she said. “In fact, the differences are mostly by chance, which I think is beautiful. Sometimes human variation is just random.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/health/birth-canals-evolution.html,health,The New York Times,health,828

2017-06-23 00:00:00,2017,6.0,23,"Obamacare tops 50 percent support for first time, new poll shows","The Affordable Care Act for the first time is now viewed favorably by more than half of all Americans, according to a new poll released a day after the introduction of a Republican-drafted Senate bill which would gut that major health-care law better known as Obamacare. In the past seven years that included 79 separate tracking surveys, the Kaiser Family Foundation had never before found more than 50 percent support for Obamacare by the public. A total of 51 percent of Americans now sees the ACA positively. The poll also found that a House bill which closely resembles the new Senate bill released Thursday is still widely unpopular with the public — and that support for the House's proposal to repeal and replace much of Obamacare has significantly dropped among Republicans. Fifty-five percent of the public views the House's American Health Care Act unfavorably, compared with just 30 percent with favorable views of that bill, according to the survey. And since May, support among Republicans for the House bill has dropped from 67 percent to 56 percent. The House's bill barely won passage in May. Kaiser's survey additionally revealed that strong majorities of Americans, regardless of political stripe, have favorable views of Medicaid, the government health coverage program for the poor. Only slightly above one-third of people support cuts to the expansion of Medicaid benefits to more poor adults that Obamacare put into place, and for changing federal funding for all of Medicaid, which would limit how much states receive in financial support. Both of those proposals are key parts of the Senate and House bills, which would also change the way the federal government subsidizes the purchase of private individual health plans. The survey also found that large shares of the public, and majorities of people in both major political parties, supported the federal government barring health insurers from charging people with pre-existing health conditions more money for their coverage, and requiring that insurance plans cover a certain minimum set of health benefits. Both the Senate and House bills could weaken such control by the federal government. ""The public at large is deeply skeptical about the repeal-and-replace plan, with support among the Republican base hanging in but slipping and in danger of falling further,"" said Drew Altman, CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation. Half of the public believed ""they and their family will be better off if the Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land, compared to a little more than a third (36) who think they will be better off under the Republican plan,"" Kaiser said in a summary of the poll results. Republicans were more likely than Democrats and independents to say they would be better off under a replacement plan, by a ratio of 3-to-1.

2018-08-05 00:00:00,2018,8.0,5,Solving Everest's mounting poop problem," (CNN)When climbing enthusiasts take a stab at the highest mountain in the world, thinking about their bodily waste is probably low on their list of priorities. This season, porters working on Everest schlepped 28,000 pounds of human waste — the equivalent weight of two fully-grown elephants -- from base camp down to a nearby dumping site, according to the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee (SPCC), a local NGO tasked with cleaning up Everest. At Gorak Shep, a frozen lakebed 17,000 feet above sea level, waste matter is dumped in open pits where it shrivels and dehydrates. But there is a risk that it will leak into a river and contaminate the water supply system, explains Garry Porter, a retired mountaineer and engineer from Washington state. ""It's unsightly and unsanitary, it's a health issue and an environmental nightmare,"" Porter tells CNN. ""I experienced the thrill and grandeur of Mount Everest, but I also saw what happens when we, the Western world, leave, as if our waste doesn't stink."" But Porter doesn't fault climbers, as he says their main preoccupation is summiting and returning home in one piece. Nor are Nepalese authorities to blame, says Porter, as there are no waste treatment plants nearby. Yangji Doma, of the SPCC, agrees that the current human waste management system is problematic. ""We make sure that it's not dumped on the glacier itself,"" she tells CNN. ""But the main problem is ... it's very cold and it doesn't naturally degrade, we understand that. It's managed but it's not sustainably managed.""  Read: Nepal fast facts So Porter, along with fellow climber Dan Mazur, established the Mount Everest Biogas Project almost eight years ago to try get rid of this ""environmental hazard.""  Over the years they have been toying with the idea of installing a biogas digester at Gorak Shep to convert human waste into methane gas. While biogas digesters are used around the world, and fairly easy to make, they are difficult to operate at altitude in sub-zero temperatures. This is because the process requires bacteria to feed on organic waste, and these living microorganisms need to be kept warm, explains Porter. The Mount Everest Biogas Project plans to use a solar array panel to transmit heat into the digester. There will also be a battery array to store energy at night when the sun sets. Read: The dangers of oxygen deprivation on Everest The end products will be methane gas, which can be used for cooking or lighting, and effluent that can be used as fertilizer for crops. ""It takes a nasty product and makes two products that can be used by the Nepali people,"" explains Porter. However, Porter says climbers often take antibiotics, and he was initially concerned that antibiotics in the poop might impact the microbes' ability to break down the waste. But he says mini digesters at Kathmandu University successfully converted human waste from base camp to methane gas. The team still needs to test whether the effluent will be free of hazardous microorganisms and therefore safe to use as fertilizer. Porter says they will begin testing the effluent this year and if it is dangerous, the plan is to filter out contaminants in an underground septic system. Read: Rebuilding a Nepali village, one block at a time The Mount Everest Biogas Project has a signed agreement with the SPCC and is ready to break ground once they have raised the necessary funds. Porter estimates that the first digester will cost around $500,000, mostly because of the transportation cost to lug the materials up to Gorak Shep.

2016-03-24 09:39:34,2016,3.0,24,Get Ready to Pay More to Have Others Do Your Chores,"Bits Got a minute? It may not be worth what you think. Ride-hailing services like Uber and shopping services like Instacart have been booming for the last few years, allowing people to save time without spending a fortune. Now, writes Farhad Manjoo, grim reality is entering the picture: The real cost of convenience appears to be rising. Take Luxe, a valet parking service that charged $5 an hour, or $15 a day, to have someone park your vehicle, saving drivers the hassle of finding a spot in a congested city. As the service has grown in popularity, however, prices have doubled. Complaints about service have increased, too. On the flip side, doing things for other people may be worth less than it used to be. Instacart, which buys groceries and delivers them to its customers, has, like Luxe, raised its prices and has also cut the pay of some of its workers. What we are seeing is, in effect, a rolling auction for the value of personal time: What will we agree to be charged to avoid having to find a taxi, go to Whole Foods or cook dinner? How little can you pay someone else to do these things, with some reliability? Since not all chores are equally onerous, the value keeps shifting. Uber, which vies with protectionist taxi fleets, has done well. SpoonRocket, which made and delivered meals that cost less than $10, closed this month after burning through $13.5 million (and earning mixed reviews on the quality of the food). Apparently more people were O.K. with making their own inexpensive meals. Certainly, this could just be the shakedown cruise common in tech booms, the point where something that claims to “change everything” ends up changing just a few things. Like taxis — or local trucking. On Wednesday a start-up called Convoy announced it had raised $16 million, on top of an initial $2.5 million, to build a network of truckers who are willing to haul things generally within a day’s drive. A similar company, Cargomatic, has raised $17 million. Of course, auctioning off who is going to haul gravel isn’t about saving affluent people a few minutes. It’s about saving gravel companies money. And the drivers don’t have to worry that the gravel might give them a bad rating on Yelp.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/technology/get-ready-to-pay-more-to-have-others-do-your-chores.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,384

New research shows this is very much not the case, and that each year around 13,500 kids are treated in US hospital emergency rooms after falling from their hoverboards. That amounts to about 40 ER visits each day.The disingenuously named hoverboards, or self-balancing two-wheeled scooters, were all the rage a few years ago, prompting Sean Bandzar, an emergency physician at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, to investigate the rate and nature of injuries caused by the devices. While he was as it, he also decided to compare these figures to injuries caused by conventional skateboards, the results of which were published this week in the science journal Pediatrics. Data for the study was pulled from the CPSC’s National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, which includes data on emergency department visits across the United States. The researchers looked at the years 2015 and 2016, and investigated hoverboard and skateboard injuries among children under the age of 18. Users with hoverboard injuries (light gray) and skateboard injuries (dark gray) showing up at ERs in 2015 and 2016.Image:  S. Bandzar et al., 2018/PediatricsDuring the period analyzed, some 26,854 kids were treated for injuries related to hoverboards, and 121,398 for skateboard injuries. Hoverboard injuries peaked between the ages of 11 to 13, and slightly more boys (52 percent) were hurt compared to girls. Two-thirds of all hoverboard injuries happened inside the home, whereas most skateboard injuries happened outside on the sidewalk or on the street.Of all the ER visits prompted by hoverboard injuries, only three were the result of burns—and none of them had anything to do with overheating batteries.  “Two patients sustained injuries from riding a hoverboard in the kitchen and colliding with a stove of boiling water,” write the researchers in the new study. “The other patient developed a friction burn after his or her finger was run over by a hoverboard.”The real culprit, as the new research points out, came from falls off of hoverboards. Among both hoverboarders and skateboarders, wrists were the most common body part injured—the part that tends to take the brunt when we fall back and brace ourselves for impact with the ground. Other injured body parts included the forearm, head, and ankles. The most common diagnosis among both groups were fractures, at 40 percent. Other injuries included bruises and sprains. The types of injuries tended to be similar among both hoverboarders and skateboarders, though the latter group recorded more sprains. Around 95 percent of all kids were discharged from the ER after receiving treatment, while 3 percent had injuries that warranted admittance to the hospital (the remaining 2 percent bailed from the ER before hospital staff had a chance to see them).In terms of limitations, the researchers didn’t investigate how hoverboards or skateboards actually cause injuries, and they didn’t consider the kinds of protective gear that might have been worn by the injured riders, though an earlier (and very small) study suggested hoverboard riders don’t tend to wear protective gear. Finally, the researchers didn’t compare the nature or rates of these injuries to those caused by other recreational activities or sports. The new study was simply a look at the raw statistics on the matter. These results are revealing, but not altogether surprising. It takes time to learn how to ride a hoverboard properly, and formal training isn’t really part of the conversation, at least not yet. Despite these stats, however, hoverboards and skateboards are good in that they get kids moving and active—we don’t want to discourage this behavior. The researchers say their work highlights the importance of wearing protective gear, such as helmets, wrist guards, and protective knee pads, combined with parental supervision. Given that hoverboards are probably already uncool, injuries like these are likely on the decline. Parents, you’ll now have to be on the lookout for the next wacky thing that could hurt your kids. And in the meantime, please steer your hoverboarding offspring away from boiling pots.[Pediatrics]",https://gizmodo.com/crashing-into-boiling-water-and-other-ways-hoverboards-1824140514,Health,Gizmodo,health,679
2017-02-02 00:00:00,2017,2.0,2,Uber ups the ante in fight with Taiwan authorities by suspending service,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] said it will suspend its service in Taiwan from Feb. 10, firing the latest salvo in the ride-hailing service company’s long-running dispute with the island’s authorities over mounting fines. Uber’s move comes after Taiwan recently raised fines against unlicensed ride-sharing services, targeted at Uber, which the company said were the highest in the world. Taiwan has maintained Uber’s business is illegal, and at one point last year even considered ordering it to leave the domestic market. The U.S.-based firm has been asked to pay T$328.59 million ($10.57 million) in fines so far, with over half the sum slapped on it since early January, when higher penalties of as much as T$25 million per infraction took effect, according to figures from Taiwan’s Ministry of Transportation and Communications. Uber has paid T$68.25 million to date, the ministry said. The company has protested fines against it and defended its model, and in November issued an open letter to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen to intervene, appealing to her push to turn Taiwan into a Silicon Valley in Asia. But the higher fines seem to have driven matters to a head. “We will pause our operations until the president and her government find a solution,” Damian Kassabgi, director of Uber’s public policy in Asia-Pacific, said in an emailed statement. Uber said there was no timeline for how long the suspension would last. The suspension would not affect UberEATS, its the meal takeaway service that relies primarily on scooters for deliveries and was launched in November last year on the island. “From the view of protecting consumer rights, the government must have some control,” Hu Ti-chi, a ministry official, told a news briefing on Thursday. “Our position has never been to chase Uber out. If there is anywhere we can counsel we will provide it, but it must be a legitimate business.” Uber operates in Taiwan as an internet-based technology platform rather than as a transportation company, which local taxi companies and Taiwanese authorities have said is a misrepresentation of its service. The company has argued that it provides a technology service and has said there are over 10,000 driver-partners, mainly local citizens, registered on its platform in Taiwan who use the opportunity afforded by Uber to earn money. Hu said if Uber is not regulated as a transportation company, it can be regulated as a transportation service provider and collaborate with local taxi companies. There was room to discuss how it could be regulated, Hu said. Uber said in a statement that it had taken the initiative in discussions with Taiwan, including securing local insurance and reaching out to collaborate with the local taxi industry. Uber, headquartered in San Francisco, has been facing similar legal scrutiny in markets across Asia. With steep fines imposed on its drivers in Macau, Uber had decided to pull out of the Chinese-ruled gambling hub, although later it aborted the plans citing support from residents. In Japan, which bars non-professional drivers from offering taxi services, it was blocked by authorities from setting up in two cities while it also faced opposition from established taxi operators. But a window of opportunity finally cracked open with the ride-hailing firm starting pilot services for elderly people in rural towns last year. In Tokyo, Uber operates as a travel agent, connecting users to established taxi company drivers. Reporting by J.R.

The company’s shares rose 7.2 percent in early trading after it forecast injectables revenue of $825 million-$850 million, up from its previous estimate of $775 million-$825 million. Injectable opioid painkillers, which hospitals use to manage pain after operations and in terminal illness, have been in short supply for more than a year largely due to production problems at top supplier Pfizer. To take advantage of the shortfall, Hikma has been focusing on the manufacture of opioid products such as fentanyl, meperidine and morphine. London-listed Hikma also raised full-year expectations for its generics division. Generics revenue for the full-year is now expected in the range of $675 million to $700 million, the company said, up from $600 million to $650 million projected earlier by the company. In a separate statement, Hikma said it signed an agreement with Vectura Group plc for the global development and commercialisation of generic versions of GSK’s Ellipta portfolio.

2020-03-19 00:00:00,2020,3.0,19,FDA says no scientific evidence that ibuprofen worsens coronavirus,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday it is not aware of scientific evidence connecting the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen, with worsening COVID-19 symptoms. The agency said it is aware of news reports stating the use of these medicines - commonly used to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and bring down fever - could worsen the infection caused by the coronavirus. Particularly after France’s health minister suggested that NSAIDs could worsen COVID-19, demand for alternatives such as Johnson & Johnson’s Tylenol surged, prompting the drugmaker to scale up production. J&J is running its Tylenol manufacturing at maximum capacity in North America to meet surging demand due to the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak, a top executive said on Thursday. The issue is being further investigated and more information will be made public when available, the FDA said. However, the agency added that all prescription NSAID labels warn that the use of these medicines may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. On Wednesday, the European Medicines Agency also said that there is no scientific evidence showing that the widely used anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen worsens the effects of the coronavirus.

2017-01-11 10:22:38,2017,1.0,11,Virtual Reality on the Cheap? Try These Apps on Your Phone,"App Smart AT last week’s annual International CES, one of the largest technology conventions, virtual reality goggles were hyped as a way to get a taste of the immersive 3-D technology. Yet many people may be able to sample virtual reality just by using their phones with the right apps. Start with the Within app, which is a free iOS and Android download. It uses so-called 360-degree video technology, which is similar to virtual reality and lets you look at a video in every direction and to interact with and explore a movie scene. Within works like this: Imagine you are watching a regular film on your phone — with a point of view decided by where the filmmaker was pointing a camera. In the app, you can move your phone around in the air, looking all around and up and down, as you slide your viewpoint all around the scene, seeing the actors and the set wrapping all around you. It’s almost as if you were there standing among the actors. At first it may feel unnerving, and you may find yourself bumping into things in your real-life room. But you will be mesmerized. Within has access to a short list of 360-degree videos, including a music video made by U2 and a specially filmed short episode of the hit TV series “Mr. Robot.” You simply choose one of the videos, hit play and decide either to download the film for later viewing or to stream it. To watch the Within clips another way, use a Google Cardboard device (usually around $20). This simple hardware converts your phone into a full virtual-reality goggle system, so you will see the clips in 3-D. This is even more of a taste of the future. An alternative app called Jaunt VR has similar features. It also has a catalog of 360-degree video that can be viewed on a phone screen or through Google Cardboard or a similar device. The app has a slightly longer list of films available, and in many ways it’s an excellent peer to Within. But the video quality seemed lower, and the menu system is a little more clunky. Nevertheless, it’s a free iOS and Android download, so you may as well try it out. Google also has a free iOS and Android app to accompany its Cardboard product. It’s simple, but it does help you set up Cardboard and acts as a portal to some virtual reality experiences. On Android, there’s an even more interesting free Google app called Cardboard Camera. This app guides you in making 360-degree circular panorama photos, making you spin around with your phone held out to capture a scene. You can then view your creations later in the Cardboard app. Not quite as impressive as an immersive 360-degree video, but still fun. There are also some virtual reality gaming apps worth trying, like the Cardboard-compatible InMind 2 game. You move through the play area by solving puzzles (mainly by looking at a target until it is selected). Along the way, some information will pop up that teaches you how human brains work. The graphics are smoothly animated and surreal and may remind you of the psychedelic scenes from the film “2001: A Space Odyssey.” The 3-D effect as you look around is impressive and amusing, though not particularly high resolution. InMind 2 is a free iOS and Android download, which gives you a good start in the game. It costs $3 to download more levels. For a more exciting game, check out End Space VR. This is a space shooter game where enemies can fly at you from all angles, including above and behind you. It works both with Cardboard-like devices and in non-3-D mode, where you wave your phone around. The graphics are fun, and the gameplay is simple but has enough to keep you interested. End Space is a $1 iOS download. On Android, the game is called Minos Starfighter, also for $1. Enjoy these samples of virtual reality and play safely. Try not to fall over in real life as you wiggle your head around in virtual space. The Happiness Planner is a different type of calendar app. Instead of merely helping organize to-do lists and events, the app has a focus on raising your happiness levels. It encourages you to think positively and practice self-reflection by setting regular goals. Attractively designed, this iOS app is free to use for 14 days and then costs $3 a month for access to all features.",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/technology/personaltech/virtual-reality-on-the-cheap-try-these-apps-on-your-phone.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,754

2019-03-28 00:00:00,2019,3.0,28,"Mother Leaves Hospital With Newborn, Not Knowing She's Also Pregnant With Twins","Image:  Christopher Furlong (Getty Images)A new mother in Bangladesh got quite a surprise last week: Less than a month after she had delivered a healthy baby boy, she returned to the hospital and delivered a set of fraternal twins, who, unbeknownst to her, had been growing inside a second uterus. Thankfully, all three children were delivered without complications.The double delivery was initially reported this week by the AFP. According to interviews with Sheila Poddar, the woman’s doctor and a gynecologist at Ad-Din hospital in Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka, the mom wasn’t aware of her unique situation until she was forced to seek medical attention for lower abdominal pain and got an ultrasound. “She didn’t realize she was still pregnant with the twins. Her waters broke again 26 days after the first baby was born and she rushed to us,” Poddar told the AFP.Women born with two uteruses aren’t unheard of. The formal name for the condition is called uterus didelphys. Estimates of how common it is are grainy, largely because many women  experience no symptoms as a result of the condition.  But it’s probably very rare. One 2011 review, for instance, estimated that 0.3 percent of women in the general population had two uteruses. Some afflicted women do seem to be at higher risk for complications while pregnant or at the time of delivery. In this case, though, the boy and girl twins were delivered successfully via cesarean section with no added difficulties.There actually have been case reports of dual pregnancies from women with two uteruses (and even from one who also had two cervixes). And the triple whammy isn’t unprecedented either, according to a 1981 case report. In that situation, the first two babies were delivered prematurely at 27 weeks, while the third took another 72 days to arrive.What makes this case especially notable is the lack of prior notice before the twins’ birth. According to Poddar, the mystery was one of human doing, not biology. Doctors didn’t perform an ultrasound during the woman’s pregnancy, which would have caught the extra babies.Quirky as the woman’s story is, it has troubling implications. The lack of an ultrasound that’s standard practice in countries like the U.S. is indicative of the poor healthcare system in Bangladesh, and of the financial insecurity many of its residents face, especially those who live in rural areas. And though the woman and her three children were all able to leave the hospital in good health, she is nevertheless worried about being able to care for her new family, given her husband’s meager wages as a laborer.“I don’t know how we will manage such a huge responsibility with this little amount,” she told the AFP.

2020-02-26 00:00:00,2020,2.0,26,Can Lysol and Clorox products kill the novel coronavirus? The answer is ... complicated," (CNN)Lysol, Clorox and a host of other household disinfectants widely tout their ability to kill 99.9% of bacteria and viruses. The claim is right there on the label. Included in that 99.9%?  Human coronavirus. It's advertised on the back as a disease the product can disinfect from surfaces, along with two flu strains, E. coli and salmonella, among others. That sparks some obvious questions, mainly: Would it work for the new coronavirus that's spreading around the globe? The answer, it turns out, is complicated.  The US Environmental Protection Agency has some guidance: The disinfectants are thought to be effective against the novel coronavirus. But until tests confirm this, its ability to kill the novel coronavirus has not been scientifically proven.  While the risk of getting novel coronavirus in the US remains low largely due to successful containment efforts, a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official warned Tuesday that the agency expected to see ""community spread"" of the virus in America. ""It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness,"" said CDC National Prevention Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Director Dr. Nancy Messonnier. The novel coronavirus is, as the name suggests, new The ""human coronavirus"" mention on the back of Lysol and Clorox wipes got people wondering -- is the novel coronavirus all that new?  Without a doubt, yes. The novel coronavirus is a new virus. The current outbreak began around the beginning of 2020.   But human coronaviruses in general are not new.  They were first identified in the 1960s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and there are seven overall types. The novel coronavirus is the most recently identified type -- hence the word ""novel"" in its name. There are no vaccines or antiviral treatments that specifically target it.  Disinfectants may be effective against the novel coronavirus  Disinfectant products that have been proven effective in protecting against the other human coronaviruses are thought to be effective against the novel coronavirus, too, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, Adalja said. ""We know that viruses that lack an envelope coating are much hardier in the environment,"" he said. And under the EPA's guidance for emerging viral pathogens, since Lysol, and Clorox and other disinfectants have been proven to effectively kill other human coronaviruses, users can safely use the wipes and sprays to disinfect surfaces in areas where the novel coronavirus is suspected. In a statement to CNN, the EPA said companies can apply for an ""emerging pathogens claim"" based on previously approved claims for harder-to-kill viruses. The agency reviews them and determines whether the company can safely make that claim.  Once approved, the company can make off-label claims in the event of outbreaks like the novel coronavirus.  Several Lysol products have been approved to make emerging viral pathogens claims for efficacy against the novel coronavirus, the EPA told CNN.  But ""definitive scientific confirmation"" that the wipes can defend against this specific virus can only come once it's been tested against the strain, said Reckitt Benckiser, the company that owns Lysol and other hygiene brands, in a statement to CNN. But the novel coronavirus is primarily spread between people Here's the thing, though: from what we know so far, it's still early, the novel coronavirus is thought to spread primarily by people and their respiratory droplets -- think coughs, sneezes, spit. Person-to-person transmission is most common, the CDC said.  While it's possible that people who touch surfaces or objects contaminated with the virus and then touch their mouths or eyes can also become infected, this may not be the main way the virus spreads, the CDC said. So disinfectant wipes can only go so far. Plus, Lysol and Clorox are disinfectants designed for surfaces in homes, not for body parts. And even hand sanitizers aren't foolproof protections against all germs.  Saskia Popescu, a senior infection prevention epidemiologist and consultant for Clorox, said Americans should not panic about contracting the novel coronavirus within the US.But if they're concerned, she recommends following the same practices they would if they were trying to avoid the common respiratory infections you can catch this time of year: Scrub hands clean with soap and water, wipe down shared work spaces with those disinfectant wipes and cover coughs and sneezes.  ""All those basic things are effective, whether it's a novel coronavirus or influenza,"" she told CNN.Clarification: This piece has been updated to include comments from Dr. Amesh Adalja and to clarify Saskia Popescu's position as a consultant for Clorox.

2020-02-18 00:00:00,2020,2.0,18,Inactive teens may be more prone to depression,"(Reuters Health) - Sedentary teens may be more likely than their active peers to be depressed, and a new study suggests even light exercise like walking might help reduce this risk. Following more than 4,000 young people from age 12 to age 18, researchers found physical activity levels declined as kids got older. But those who were the most sedentary at ages 12 through 16 were the most likely to have symptoms of depression at 18. Conversely, kids who maintained or increased light physical activity across the years had the lowest depression risk at 18. “Our results suggest young people should aim to reduce their sedentary behavior and increase their light activity during adolescence, a time when the opposite tends to occur,” said lead study author Aaron Kandola of University College London in the UK. “This could reduce the risk of depression in the future.” “Most children should have no trouble finding 60 minutes a day for activity, whatever form it takes,” Kandola said. The structure of the school day is a major source of inactivity and sedentary behavior, Kandola said by email. “Simple changes could be tried to address this, such as active/interactive classes, active homework, activity breaks in the middle of lessons, increasing the walking distance between classes, implementing standing desks for some lessons,” Kandola said. While previous studies have linked exercise to improved physical and mental health, much of this research has focused on adults and failed to objectively measure exercise levels, Kandola and his colleagues note in The Lancet Psychiatry. For the study, the researchers analyzed data on 4,257 young people who wore accelerometers for a week when they were 12, 14 and 16 years old. Participants also completed questionnaires designed to identify any symptoms of depression or other mental health disorders at age 18. Accelerometers objectively measured when participants engaged in light activity like walking or more intense exercise like running or cycling. The devices also recorded periods when teens were sedentary, doing things like homework or playing video games. Between ages 12 and 16, participants’ average daily sedentary time increased from about seven hours to almost nine hours. Over this same period, their average daily time devoted to light activity like walking or doing chores dropped from about five hours to around two hours. Each additional hour of sedentary time at ages 12 and 14 was associated with an 8% to 11% higher risk of depression symptoms by age 18, the study found. The reverse was also true, with each additional 60 minutes per day of light physical activity lowering the odds of depression at age 18 by 8% to 11%. Even though the study wasn’t designed to prove whether or how sedentary time might compromise mood, or how activity might make mental health problems less likely, the findings are in line with past research in adults, the authors note. It’s possible activity improves self-esteem, reduces inflammation or stimulates the growth of new neurons in the brain, they write. “Exercise has been linked to neurogenesis (the forming of new brain cells) and neuroplasticity (ability for the brain to rewire and make new connections), which can be protective for mental health,” said Karmel Choi, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston who coauthored a commentary accompanying the study. “When people are getting more physical activity, their bodies also tend to be less reactive to stress and show lower levels of inflammation, a risk factor for depression,” Choi said by email.

2019-11-11 00:00:00,2019,11.0,11,T-Mobile CEO John Legere is a candidate to become new CEO of WeWork,"WeWork has spoken to T-Mobile CEO John Legere about possibly taking over the embattled coworking company, sources told CNBC's David Faber on Monday. The Wall Street Journal first reported that the talks had taken place. Shares of T-Mobile slid 3% on the news. WeWork is conducting a search for a CEO and Legere is among several candidates being considered, Faber reported. The search is ongoing and no decision has been made, sources said. A source close to SoftBank confirmed Legere is one of many candidates being considered for the role, but he's not the leading candidate. Representatives from T-Mobile and WeWork were not immediately available for comment. SoftBank representatives declined to comment. WeWork has been searching for a new CEO following the departure of Adam Neumann, a co-founder, in September. Co-CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham took over after Neumann exited the company. T-Mobile and WeWork have leadership in place that runs in similar circles. SoftBank, which took control of WeWork last month, is a majority owner of Sprint and played a role in installing Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure. Claure, who was recently named WeWork's executive chairman, helped orchestrate the $26 billion merger with T-Mobile, which is widely expected to be approved. Legere is expected to step down as T-Mobile's CEO once the deal with Sprint is complete. Faber reported in July that T-Mobile President and COO Mike Sievert is expected to take over as CEO once the deal closes. --CNBC's Sally Shin contributed to this report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/t-mobile-ceo-john-legere-is-reportedly-in-talks-to-become-new-ceo-of-wework.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,247
2017-05-22 15:31:00,2017,5.0,22,Robot Artists Compete for Thousands of Dollars at This Painting Competition​,"Internet entrepreneur Andrew Conru wants to answer one question: can robots create beauty? Whether via a robotic arm holding paintbrush to canvas, tiny snakebots moving across a page, or drones dropping color, it's looking like an automated yes.  ""If you think of the art that's made by human artists, it's quite diverse,"" Conru tells Creators. ""Every generation tries to come up with a new genre, a new style, a new category of art. I don't see robot art as any different, than yet another way for people to express themselves.""  In the second year of his annual Robot Art Competition, 38 teams from ten different countries produced 200 artworks, developing inventive techniques to coax machines to create representational or emotive artworks. There's just one rule: the robots must paint. ""We're using something as messy as paint because there is an organic nature to it,"" says Conru. ""It has something real to it. There's a complexity with layers of things that are very tangible and very human.""  On a very basic level, inventors must command a robot to move from one place to another. ""It's almost like talking to a small child,"" says Conru. ""Take a brush, go to this location, stroke it to the right three inches, and then lift up.""  The first place team, PIX18 / Creative Machines Lab from Columbia University, used an industrial robot arm to create the pieces for their winning entry, programming it with an algorithm to achieve masterful brush strokes, either replicating famous works of art or creating completely new pieces. When human painters paint, they're almost always using some algorithm,"" says Conru. ""An algorithm is just a fancy way of saying rules or technique. A very simple algorithm says put color in the place that's expected, but more elaborate ones can say to be messy and to have the errors that a free flowing human would paint. When you start doing that, you can deconstruct almost every human painting. Every painter has their algorithm and each one of these teams are using their own technique."" The second place team, CMIT ReART from Kasetsart University, produced an algorithm by measuring the force of an artist's paintbrush, recreating the strokes found in pieces like van Gogh's  The Starry Night. The team also created original pieces, as did third place team CloudPainter, who used machine learning to merge artists' styles, deriving aesthetics from painting or photograph. The possibilities are infinite. ""There's a range of artists that come in and use it as a development tool, or to actually generate a full art form,"" says Conru.  The human element should not be overlooked and the use of a robot can be viewed as just another tool for the artist to use in the creative process. Conru thinks the appearance of robotic technology draws parallels to the introduction of the camera in the 19th century, a technological innovation that originally terrified painters but soon produced Impressionism.  ""I think technology tools, such as the robotic art and algorithms that we're playing with here, opens us to a future that blurs the lines of what is the artist and what are you trying to accomplish with your medium,"" he says.  To see more of this year's winning work, go here.

Pastor Billy Jones preached to around 100 cars from an open lorry in the car park of the protestant Dunseverick Baptist Church on Sunday as mass goers - some on their own, others with their cars full - tuned in to his words on their car radios. “Today was rather different,” Jones told Reuters after he greeted each car as it left the church, situated between the picturesque Giant’s Causeway and Old Bushmills Whiskey Distillery. “We were avoiding any contact with one another, yet we were in an environment where people received encouragement, comfort and indeed challenge from the word of God,” he said, urging the community to work together to tackle the virus.

2017-08-11 00:00:00,2017,8.0,11,France says contaminated eggs were sold but health risk minimal,"PARIS (Reuters) - Nearly 250,000 eggs contaminated with an insecticide have reached shops in France and most of them have already been eaten, the French farm ministry said on Friday, adding that it saw minimal health risks from the incident. “The levels of actual contamination do not pose any risks for consumers,” it said, citing an investigation by France’s health and safety agency that pointed to “very low” risks. “But while the risk to human health has been ruled out, investigations are being actively pursued at poultry farms and manufacturing sites of egg-based products,” it added. Millions of chicken eggs have been pulled from European supermarket shelves due to the presence of fipronil, with several European countries affected by the incident. The popular insecticide, used to treat pets for fleas and ticks, is banned in the food chain and Dutch police arrested two directors of a local company on Thursday in an investigation into the source of the contamination. In France, a batch of 196,000 contaminated eggs was imported from Belgium and put on the market between April 16 and May 2, followed by a second batch of 48,000 eggs from the Netherlands that reached shops between July 19-28, the farm ministry said in a statement. The eggs from the first batch and some from the second would have been consumed by now, the ministry said, adding that eggs still on sale from the second batch had been removed from shelves by the retailer concerned - the Leader Price chain owned by Casino. The French authorities had previously identified five food processing factories that had received contaminated eggs from Belgium and the Netherlands. They had now identified a further two food factories that had imported contaminated egg-based ingredients from Belgium, the ministry said. The European Commissioner charged with food safety called on Friday for a meeting of ministers and national watchdogs to discuss the egg contamination scare that has provoked finger-pointing between European Union countries.

2017-12-04 00:00:00,2017,12.0,4,Broadcom set to unveil a challenge to Qualcomm's board: Sources,"Chipmaker Broadcom will take its first formal step on Monday toward a hostile bid to take over Qualcomm, unveiling nominees whom Qualcomm shareholders can vote on to replace the U.S. semiconductor company's board of directors, according to people familiar with the matter. Broadcom's move comes after Qualcomm rejected its $103 billion cash-and-stock bid last month. Qualcomm shareholders who want the company to engage in sale talks will be able to vote on Broadcom's board director slate on March 6. Broadcom has lined up nine men and two women as board director nominees, many of whom have considerable experience in the technology sector, the sources said on Sunday. Private-equity firm Silver Lake, an investor in Broadcom, has helped with the effort to recruit the nominees, the sources added. Broadcom will not be unveiling any new offer for Qualcomm on Monday, the sources said. It has been considering an improved bid, and will likely present it by March based on the reception its board director slate receives from Qualcomm shareholders, the sources added. Reuters reported last month that Broadcom was considering raising its offer by offering more of its own stock. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Broadcom and Qualcomm declined to comment. The board director slate that Broadcom puts forward will be heavily scrutinized, because its nominees will not just be asked to put Qualcomm up for sale, but will have to oversee the company until a deal with Broadcom closes. Broadcom has said regulators may take a year to approve an acquisition of Qualcomm, while Qualcomm has countered that the regulatory review process globally could last much longer and is fraught with risks. Qualcomm is also engaged in a patent infringement dispute with Apple. Unless that legal spat is resolved in the next few months, Broadcom's board director nominees will have to oversee the resolution of that issue as well. Qualcomm is also trying to close its $38 billion acquisition of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors after signing a deal in October 2016. Broadcom has indicated it is willing to acquire Qualcomm irrespective of whether it closes the NXP deal. NXP shares have been trading above Qualcomm's $110-per-share offer price, as many NXP shareholders, including hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, have been holding out for a better price. The spread has tightened, however, in the past month. NXP shares ended trading on Friday at $114.78. Qualcomm does not need to decide to raise its offer for NXP until that deal receives antitrust clearance from all the regulators reviewing the deal around the world.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/04/broadcom-set-to-unveil-a-challenge-to-qualcomms-board-sources.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,428

2017-03-30 00:00:00,2017,3.0,30,Georgia Senate passes expansion of limited medical marijuana law,"(Reuters) - The Georgia state Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly passed a bill that would expand the state’s limited medical marijuana law to include people with 15 medical conditions, up from nine currently. The bill now goes to Governor Nathan Deal to sign into law. Unlike many other U.S. states that have medical marijuana laws that allow smokable and edible forms of cannabis to be used by people who have a wide range of conditions, Georgia only allows cannabis oil and even then, for a limited number of maladies. The state Senate passed the expansion by a 45-6 vote. The measure was earlier approved by Georgia’s House of Representatives. Georgia’s limited medical marijuana law was enacted in 2015. If signed into law by Deal, the expansion will add to the initial nine conditions allowed by the state. The governor’s office declined to comment on whether Deal would sign the bill. Users must be registered with state health officials and prove to be under a physician’s care for the conditions allowed in Georgia’s medical marijuana law. State Senator Matt Brass said in a telephone interview on Thursday that he is part of the majority of lawmakers in Georgia who do not want to legalize marijuana for recreational use. Brass said he supported the expansion because he wanted those with autism to be allowed to be use cannabis oil after obtaining a doctor’s approval. The bill as passed allows use for those with severe autism, Brass said. The other conditions that would be added include Alzheimer’s disease, AIDS and Tourette’s syndrome. Current conditions allowed to use medical marijuana in the state include cancer, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and Crohn’s disease. Georgia has about 1,300 people approved to use of cannabis oil for the initial nine conditions, according to Brass. He said he did know how many people would be affected by the expansion if signed into law.

2020-01-28 00:00:00,2020,1.0,28,"Homework is pointless, here's what you should do instead","Elissa Strauss writes about the politics and culture of parenthood. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.   (CNN)We live, for the most part, fairly similar lives to our next-door neighbors. Both households have two working parents, two kids and an appreciation for the way California weather affords them unscripted, outdoor play year-round.  We are all busier than we want to be, but our neighbors have an extra, unnecessary hurdle that makes life more difficult. Next door, the kids have homework. This involves 30 minutes of child-wrangling and patience-testing five days a week, pressure-cooking the little downtime they have together as a family.  Meanwhile, our family takes that time to enjoy our kids. No efficiency, no productivity, no agenda; just parents and children hanging out. There's been a lot of research and debate on the academic value of homework for school-aged children. The results, although somewhat mixed, generally conclude that homework provides no advantage for kids in elementary grades. As children get older, the potential benefits of homework grow, but less than you probably think. Missing from the homework conversation is how no-homework policies benefit the whole family -- parents and caregivers included.  School schedules and cultures were created for a different time, when moms were expected to be available to children during non-school hours. But today, the majority of families have either dual-working or single parents. Reconfiguring the education system to adapt to this current reality is a big project. We need to accommodate for the fact that nobody's home to watch kids after school and during holiday breaks, or to spend four hours building a ""Bridge to Terabithia"" diorama on a Thursday afternoon.  The remedy to this would likely involve an overhaul of our paid leave and vacation policies, as well as modifications to our daily and yearly school schedules. This is not a quick fix. Ending homework for elementary school-aged kids is, on the other hand, relatively easy. We just have to stop doing it. We need to do less Feeling overwhelmed is a defining trait of today's parents and caregivers. We have too much to do, our kids have too much to do, and leisure and happiness are the prices we pay for it. One recent survey of 2,000 parents commissioned by Crayola Experience found that more than half of parents feel they are too busy to enjoy the fun of parenting. A similar number told Pew Research Center they struggle to balance the responsibilities of home with the responsibilities of a family. We feel guilty, and we feel tired. We lack the energy to make it through the week, let alone figure out how to get ourselves out of this mess. When every minute is accounted for, sometimes two or three times over, a reprieve from something as seemingly minor as homework can make a big difference. ""The time families have together is really short; it is much shorter than what people would like. And when you are together everyone is fried,"" said Brigid Schulte, author of ""Overwhelmed: Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time"" and director of the Better Life Lab. ""If you are stressed and cranky, and your kid has been in aftercare too long, and then you get home and have to force them to do their homework, it removes the sense that home is a supportive, loving place where you can connect."" Schulte encourages parents and caregivers to resist homework. This might include fighting for no-homework policies at their children's schools, and pushing back against unrealistic homework assignments. Reach out to a teacher and tell them why a particular assignment is burdensome or causing unnecessary stress and, if this is the case, why your child won't be able to meet the teacher's expectations, she suggested. ""The most important thing is to look for small wins right now,"" she said, referring to the battle against busyness. Gaining roughly 30 minutes a night, or two-plus hours a week, has the potential to make a dramatic difference in family well-being, giving us an opportunity to remember why exactly we had children in the first place. Teach your children, and yourself, to do less It can feel scary to slow down. Rising income inequality has turned parenting into a competitive sport. It's a winner-takes-all world and we want our kids to be the winners — unhappy, stressed-out winners. There is so much out there telling your children they need to do more and be more, and that whatever they think is enough is most definitely not enough. This means that parents and caregivers provide what is likely kids' only shot at learning about leisure and togetherness. The overwhelming message from decades of research has found these are the main ingredients to happiness and well-being.  Getting rid of homework is a relatively simple way to combat this high-stakes problem. It gives parents and caregivers the opportunity to teach their children these essential -- albeit systematically ignored and undervalued -- skills. ""Kids should have a chance to just be kids and do things they enjoy, particularly after spending six hours a day in school,"" said Alfie Kohn, author of ""The Homework Myth: Why Our Kids Get Too Much of a Bad Thing.""  ""After all, we adults need time just to chill out; it's absurd to insist that children must be engaged in constructive activities right up until their heads hit the pillow."" This isn't to say that the downtime has to be mindless. Kohn suggests that parents and caregivers can, with their kids, cook, play board games, read or watch TV and then discuss what they read or watched. (Ideally, it's something parents would enjoy as well.) All of these activities require logic or analytical skills, and can help uncover kids' passions, as well as areas in which they might be struggling and need additional help.  These activities can also help kids build the kind of skills we associate with homework, said Josh Cline, a public school teacher in Oakland, California. Perseverance and stamina, for example, are required to sit through a story and then discuss it, to complete a batch of brownies or play a game of checkers or chess. ""It's better to grow those skills doing things kids find interesting than forcing them to slog through worksheets,"" he said. That said, if worksheets are your kid's thing, Cline said to give them a shot — as long as it is clear they have a choice. From an academic standpoint, Cline's main interest is for kids to be reading at home. However, he says, forcing it is likely to backfire. Instead, parents and caregivers should try to encourage reading by giving their kids plenty of choices, and, whenever possible, integrating reading into a cozy routine (that may or may not include hot chocolate). But ultimately, the best replacement for homework is, simply, a parent or caregiver's attention. ""Spend time with them and see them as people. At school, they operate as a herd, and as hard as I try as a teacher, I can't give them all the attention they deserve,"" Cline said. ""At home they should be seen as the unique, individual, interesting and brilliant people they are.""

2018-01-12 18:00:00,2018,1.0,12,How Russia Says It Swatted Down a Drone Swarm in Syria," On the night of January 5, a swarm of explosives-laden small drones, apparently controlled by Syrian rebels, attacked two Russian bases in western Syria, the Kremlin confirmed on Thursday. Authorities claim that Russian defenses destroyed or disabled all of the drones before they inflicted any damage on the bases. But the threat from small, cheap, numerous, and armed unmanned aerial vehicles isn't going away. The next swarm could be bigger and more dangerous. Ten of the drones, which the Kremlin described as ""aircraft-type,"" assaulted Khmeimim air base, where Russia stages most of its air power in Syria. A rebel artillery attack on Khmeimim on December 31 reportedly damaged or destroyed several Russian warplanes. Meanwhile, three drones attacked Russian facilities at the nearby port of Tartus. Russia intervened in the Syrian civil war on the side of the Syrian regime starting in late 2015. Each of the drones carried 10 one-pound bombs under its wings, the Kremlin said. The Russian defense ministry published photos of, it claimed, intact bombs and drones Russian troops captured during the assault. The Kremlin claimed that a Pantsir-S air-defense system shot down seven of the drones while Russian electronic-warfare specialists hacked six of the UAVs and ordered them to land, but three were destroyed when their explosives detonated. The Russian army recently commissioned its first dedicated counterdrone unit equipped with powerful electronic jamming systems. For years, Syrian rebels and Islamic State militants have been using consumer-style drones costing around $1,000 apiece to spy on rival forces, drop small bombs and conduct suicide attacks while carrying explosives. ""As both Islamic State and Amazon have shown, small drones are an efficient way of carrying a payload to a target,"" Nick Waters, a former British Army officer and independent military analyst, told me. ""Whether that payload is your new book or several hundred grams of explosive is up to the sender."" Russian troops were aware of the growing drone threat. ""The Russian side registered that insurgents started using drones of a new type and modifications,"" Maj. Gen. Alexander Novikov, head of the Russian general staff's Office of UAV Development, told reporters on Thursday. Where previously insurgents mostly deployed off-the-shelf quadcopter-style drones, the drones in the January 5 attacks were custom-built winged models powered by lawnmower or motorcycle engines and could carry more munitions than can a typical quadcopter. Novikov said all 13 drones launched from the same location no more than 60 miles from the target bases and flew toward preplanned coordinates, where they'd been programmed to drop their bombs. The precise GPS coordinates necessary for an accurate attack indicated that the drone operators sent some of their UAVs on reconnaissance runs before launching the full attack, Novikov said. The Kremlin expects more drone attacks. ""The fact that terrorists have received assembly technology and programming technology is the evidence that this threat stretches far beyond the Syrian borders,"" Novikov said. ""Such lethal drones can be applied by terrorists in any country, targeting not just military objects."" The drones grow more dangerous as they become more numerous. It's unclear how many UAVs it might take to overwhelm the defenses at facilities such as Russia's in Syria, but it's a safe bet that the swarm would cost less than $15 million, the cost of a Pantsir-S system. Militants probably can add drones more easily than governments can add air-defenses. ""In nature think how each ant is not all that smart, but they do amazing things together,"" Peter W. Singer, a drone expert and author of Wired for War, told me. ""That's what you have here with robotic swarming. It's a huge deal.""

2019-01-06 00:00:00,2019,1.0,6,What companies Wall Street bankers think Apple should buy,"Apple has a growth problem. With no game-changing product on the horizon (that we know of), it might finally make sense for Apple to acquire a company that can give it renewed life and change its Wall Street narrative. This would be highly unusual for Apple. More bluntly, it would be unprecedented. Apple ended the fourth-quarter with $237.1 billion in cash on hand and $130 billion in cash. Yet the company's largest acquisition ever was just $3 billion — its 2014 deal for Beats Electronics, the headphone-maker and streaming music company founded by rapper and producer Andre Young (Dr. Dre) and music executive Jimmy Iovine. The company has lost more than $450 billion in market value since Oct. 3. Slowing demand for iPhones and worse-than-expected sales in China led the company to lower its revenue forecast for the first quarter by as much as $9 billion. Shares fell the most in six years yesterday. Recently, CNBC asked a handful of Wall Street bankers if they thought Apple would finally make an acquisition of significance, given the company's recent woes. To a person, the answer was no. It's not in Apple's DNA, they said. There are too many cultural challenges with buying a large company for Apple, they said. Apple would get torched by the market for doing a big deal now after losing hundreds of billions in market value, they said. But, some said it feels like Apple should buy something — even if it probably won't. CEO Tim Cook told CNBC's Josh Lipton on Wednesday that the door on a large acquisition wasn't entirely shut. ""We look at many, many companies including very large companies,"" Cook said. ""We've elected so far not to do those because we haven't found one that we say, 'wow, that's a nice intersection with Apple.' But I'd never rule it out."" So what would make sense for Apple? Here are some ideas from bankers. Apple isn't really in the enterprise software game. Buying Salesforce, known for its customer-relationship management cloud-based software, would change the narrative around Apple. The company would shift from being a consumer-focused hardware designer to a business-focused, software-as-a-service provider (as well as a consumer-focused hardware designer). That sounds a bit off-focus for Apple. But maybe off-focus is what Apple wants if it needs to sell a growth story for investors. Salesforce sales jumped 26 percent from a year earlier in its most recent quarter. Annual revenue topped $10 billion as company sales have consistently grown more than 20 percent each year. Salesforce has a market capitalization of more than $100 billion. Apple's current market valuation is about $700 billion. A deal would be a huge bet even for one of the world's largest companies. Apple sales are still growing — they were up 20 percent last quarter. But the downward revenue guidance could lead to diminished growth in 2019. And Apple has recently entered some partnerships with enterprise companies, including Cisco and IBM. Apple has a history of partnering before moving on its own. It worked with Motorola in 2005 to release the Rokr E1, the first iTunes phone, before launching the iPhone in 2007. Salesforce did flirt with selling to Microsoft back in 2015. But it was a much smaller company then, with a market capitalization of about $50 billion. It's unclear if Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff is still interested in selling, but any public company has to take an offer seriously. Amazon, Google and Microsoft are all in the enterprise software business. Those companies do a lot of other things too. A departure from Apple's core competencies might be rewarded by the market instead of shunned. Apple is going to launch a new digital video service this year, which will give its mobile device owners some free content and the right to buy subscriptions to existing media channels, similar to Amazon's Prime Video Channels, according to people familiar with the matter. But if Apple truly wants a leg-up in original content, buying Disney would be the biggest move it could make. Of course, Disney is trying to complete a $71 billion deal of its own (though that could be $30 billion less or more after selling its Sky stake to Comcast and divesting Fox's regional sports networks). And Disney already has an enterprise value of more than $180 billion. With a premium, that could make a deal the largest transaction of all time. Still, the ties between Apple and Disney go way back. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was on the Disney board for years and was CEO of Pixar until he sold it to Disney. Apple's concerns about having family-friendly content for its video service jive with Disney's brand. If AT&T was willing to spend $104 billion, including debt, on Time Warner, would Apple spend well over $200 billion for Disney? Apple did investigate buying Time Warner back in 2016, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Maybe it's just been waiting for the right time to pounce on Disney. And at 67, Bob Iger can't stay CEO forever. Then again, because of Apple's size, a deal for Disney could be a tough sell for regulators, even if the companies don't really compete. Antitrust lawyers are probably rooting for this option. While buying Disney would push Apple toward being the world's largest media company, acquiring Tesla is a cleaner fit in terms of staying closer to the company's core competencies — making beautiful, user-friendly devices and operating efficiently with complicated supply chains. Tesla followers are well aware of CEO Elon Musk's desire to be a private company. Selling to Apple would take the company out of the public markets. Apple has reportedly been working on an electric car project for years. A car could be just the new ""device"" Apple needs to make its fans go wild. I'm sure they'd find it wonderful to fantasize a 5G world where a luxury Apple car talks to your other Apple devices in blissful harmony. But would Musk be interested in running Tesla within Apple, when he's only the boss of a division? It's hard to imagine him giving up on the company. Tesla revenue more than doubled from a year ago, and though the company has flirted with liquidity problems, Apple's operational expertise and huge cash reserves could theoretically help the company fight its biggest problems, keeping up the pace of production with demand. Others have speculated about an Apple-Tesla deal before. Like Disney, Tesla's appeal would be jumping to the head-of-the-class through acquisition rather than building something from scratch. And Tesla would come cheaper than Salesforce and Disney, with a market valuation of just $54 billion. So Apple could probably just buy Tesla with its net cash. In other words, funding secured.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/04/what-wall-street-bankers-think-apple-should-buy.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,1122
2016-09-08 19:54:00,2016,9.0,8,Facebook Users Have Gone from Hating to Loving the News Feed In Ten Years,"The Facebook news feed is turning 10! It's hard to imagine life before Facebook, but people hated that feed in the beginning. Now one seventh of the world is on Facebook, and the people who weren't too fond of the never-ending news feed feature are on board. From the beginning, the social network's news feed curated information that was most relevant to you. And the more you used Facebook, the more information the company (and soon enough, advertisers) had to further customize the feed.  As we all experience, Facebook doesn't just provide information on our friends, but news tailored to our particular tastes, politics, and demographics. ""News organizations, many of which have seen their businesses decimated—or bolstered—as their readers turn to Facebook for headlines, express concern that Facebook acts as a giant managing editor for the web,"" Jessi Hempel wrote for Backchannel. But Facebook denies that it plays an editorial role. ""When you think about a media company, you have people who are producing content, who are editing content, that's not us,"" Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said. ""We exist to give you the tools to curate and have the experience to connect with the people, businesses, institutions in the world that you want. So every person gets to program their own Facebook experience."" Chris Cox, chief product officer at Facebook, said the news feed solved the initial problem ten years ago of having to click around people's individual profiles to get information, rather than eventually having a platform at the center of the site that gave it to you.  Initially, the feedback from users was ""Turn it off, this sucks,"" Cox remembers. ""But, we had this conviction that if people used it, they would learn to love it."" And in response to user feedback, Facebook engineers developed an array of privacy controls that they hadn't anticipated needing before.  Cox argues that the news feed is meant to portray information that users find meaningful. And that instead of being an echo chamber of only your close friends' opinions and politics, the News Feed actually pulls mostly from ""weak ties."" ""All these people you don't normally hear from, and at least for me, that surfaces a lot more opinions from sources I wouldn't read,"" said Cox. In the past ten years, it seems as if users not only stopped hating the news feed, but have come to love it and even regard it as indispensable. Or maybe it's love/hate, if you just can't stop scrolling.

But as great as friends can be, they also do a lot of really stupid stuff. Stuff that blows your mind. Like, sometimes it seems crazy that you even hang out with people who make such crappy decisions. Stuff that, were it to get out, would be mortifying for anyone with even a shred of self-respect. Lucky for your friends, they've got you to ask their deepest, darkest questions for them. And lucky for you, we started this column to answer those most embarrassing of queries.The scenario: Your ""friend"" likes to live in the moment—which is why her baby-prevention method of choice is to shift her partner's stick into reverse seconds before he comes.The hope: That no semen equals no screamin' infants. There was, after all, a study in 2009 that suggested that the use of withdrawal leads to pregnancy just about as often as the typical use of condoms. The reality: The results of that study showed that with typical use, people indeed get pregnant 18 percent of the time using the withdrawal method—and 17 percent of the time using condoms. But given those rates, the takeaway message isn't  the pullout method is awesomely effective so much as it's:  people are really bad at using condoms correctly.Given the 18 percent rate of accidental pregnancy, we can safely assume that pull-and-pray is not a great method of keeping your friend baby-free. There are far better options: Per the most recent data on typical use, the risk of getting knocked up is 9 percent for women who are on the pill, and less than 1 percent for women using either the copper or the hormonal IUD.But wait, you might protest, my friend says that if her partner pees before sex, washing away any lingering sperm in his urethra, she's in the clear. Alas, science has one-upped this logic: A study in the Journal of Human Fertility shows that of the 41 percent of men who had sperm in their pre-ejaculate, all of them had urinated multiple times since their last romp, suggesting ""contamination"" actually occurs immediately prior to ejaculation. (Whether or not your friend's partner is the type carrying sperm in his pre-cum does seem to be a relevant question—in that study, anyway, men seemed to fall into two separate and consistent categories—but one that's hard to answer without a microscope.)   What to do: Tell your friend that she can kick the bus out of the parking lot, but the swimmers might have already snuck into the pool. Then offer to accompany her to a Planned Parenthood appointment for an IUD.    ",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mgvp4p/does-the-pullout-method-work,Health,Vice,health,453
2018-03-06 13:10:00,2018,3.0,6,People Pressured by Parents to Diet Will Push Their Kids Too,"One more reason why we need the body positivity movement: people who are pressured by their parents to lose weight will do the same to their own kids — and the shaming means they’re more likely to be overweight. These findings, part of a new study published in the journal Pediatrics, confirmed that encouragement from parents to diet has harmful effects. “Experiencing parent encouragement to diet as an adolescent was significantly associated with a higher risk of overweight or obesity, dieting, binge eating, engaging in unhealthy weight control behaviors, and lower body satisfaction 15 years later as a parent,” the study authors, from the University of Minnesota, wrote. Led by Dr. Jerica M. Berge, the wide-ranging study started with surveys of socioeconomically and racially diverse women and men in 1998-1999, as adolecents. They were surveyed again in 2015-2016, as young adult parents. The researchers say that “parent encouragement to diet as an adolescent had long-term harmful associations with weight-related and emotional health.” They suggest that doctors start talking to parents about limiting mentions of dieting in the home. “It may be important for health care providers to educate parents about the potential harmful and long-lasting consequences of engaging in encouragement to diet with their children,” they wrote.",https://people.com/health/parental-dieting-pressure-passed-down-overweight/,health,People,health,207
2019-08-20 00:00:00,2019,8.0,20,"E-cigarettes change blood vessels after just one use, study says"," (CNN)A new study is the latest to show changes in cardiovascular function after vaping e-liquids, though in this case, those liquids didn't even contain nicotine. The study, published Tuesday in the journal Radiology, concluded that vaping temporarily impacts blood vessel function in healthy people. Using MRI scans, it found, for example, changes in blood flow within the femoral artery in the leg after just one use. The researchers couldn't determine which chemical might be responsible for the changes they observed. ""After a few minutes, everything normalizes. One could say, big deal, nothing happens,"" said study author Felix W. Wehrli, professor of radiologic science and biophysics at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. ""But if someone vapes regularly,"" Wehrli continued, there's a possibility that, over time, things might not go back to normal as readily. The changes his team measured in 31 people, who had never vaped or smoked, reflect ""the same processes ... known to be initiating steps in the development of cardiovascular disease,"" including atherosclerosis. But that takes years to develop, he added. The study is the most recent addition to a proliferation of research aiming to measure the impact of e-cigarettes on the heart, blood vessels, lungs and brain. But experts say the research remains in its early stages, often taking place in the lab or in animals. A study in May, for example, found evidence that e-cigarette flavors had toxic effects -- including poorer cell survival and signs of increased inflammation -- on a type of cardiovascular cell in the lab. ""The use of e-cigarettes is increasing and the data demonstrating potential harm ... is also growing,"" doctors from the University of Massachusetts Medical School said in a commentary published alongside the May study. ""In addition to harm from the nicotine, the additives are a potential source of adverse vascular health and one that is being disproportionately placed on the young."" While experts have long suspected that vaping poses fewer health risks than smoking cigarettes, the doctors wrote that ""little is known about the potential toxicology"" of flavorings, particles, heavy metals and other components used in e-cigarettes. ""Nobody knows what it does to the human lung to breathe in and out aerosolized propylene glycol and glycerin over and over. It's an experiment, frankly,"" Dr. Robert Jackler, founder of Stanford Research Into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising, said at a congressional hearing last month. ""We will find out, years from now, the results,"" he said. Jackler said a number of chemicals used by the flavor industry may be safe when absorbed through the intestine, but we don't yet know the impact they can have on the lungs over a long period of time. ""There's no doubt in my mind that vaping is safer than conventional smoking,"" Jackler said, ""but that doesn't mean that it's safe.""

2019-12-03 12:00:00,2019,12.0,3,How to Survive Going Home for the Holidays,"OK, so you're going home for the holidays. You've packed your two most flattering black sweaters; downloaded half the Hallmark channel in case your parents' Wi-Fi is untrustworthy; triple-checked that anxiety medications are in your carry-on; and let your therapist/best friends/various and sundry social media followers know to be on standby because at least some of what awaits you is going to suuuuuuuuuck. If this last situation is the case: Here are some methods for surviving an out-of-(your chosen)-town holiday with your family in one piece—and maybe even squeezing in a few moments of genuine seasonal joy, or at least non-misery. If you're determined to go somewhere that has you reading ""survival"" tips, you (hopefully!) have a good reason. Put some thought into why so you can keep that good reason with you throughout the trip. Maybe you want to see a grandparent while they're still around, spend time with cousins, or show up for someone in your family because they asked. If you know what your mission is, you'll have a helpful answer if the going gets tough and you're asking yourself, Why did I spend a month's rent on a plane ticket, again, exactly? Talk to supportive family members about your needs before you go. People can run interference for you and set expectations with others like, ""Make sure you use [person's] correct name and pronouns. No arguments. Just do it or stay home,"" ahead of time. Enlist the family gossip to work for you for a change, as in, ""Yep, she's divorced—she wants everyone to know ahead of time so there won't be 10,000 questions about, 'Where's Steve?' No, I don't know what happened—if she wants us to know, she'll tell us. Are you still good to bring cranberry sauce?"" Folks in recovery, find out about local meetings and talk to your sponsors or counselors about setting a plan for what to do if your resolve feels shaky. Hosts can help by providing lots of non-boozy drinks—have those conversations before you go, and bring your own beverages when in doubt. Whatever your situation: Ask close friends in your support system to be on call to send memes and remind each other that you're not alone and that your trip isn't forever. Some families get huffy about""family"" staying anywhere but ""home,"" but, usually, the first time you break with ""tradition"" is the hardest. Not everyone can afford hotels, but they're a godsend if returning home means returning to the scene of childhood trauma or constant arguments. (Alternatively: Stay with friends in the area or with some of the the non-yelling relatives, housesit for somebody who is traveling, or leave the night of the holiday itself.) Staying offsite affords you peace, safety, a bed that isn't the dog's favorite recliner or something that used to inflate but doesn't now no matter how many times your dad swears at it—and also has a door that locks and that nobody is likely to knock on or yell through, a guaranteed ""out"" time, room for partners whether or not you've been married in a church, plus the possibility of actually resting on your vacation. If you're locked into staying at the homestead, are there other ways you can take a break? Volunteer to run errands, help elders wrap gifts, plan a fun cousins' brunch, babysit small people so the big people can catch a nap, be the most dedicated dog-walker who ever lived. Rae McDaniel, a licensed therapist in Chicago who specializes in working with LGBTQ clients, said, ""Affirming family members can take folks on breaks, which can be such a nice reprieve when you're stuck in the house."" Maybe a trusted sibling or cousin can step in if things get contentious to initiate a, ""We need ice right now, and I definitely need [all the non-terrible people] to come with me!"" extraction mission. If all else fails, try some self-care right where you are. Lott Hill, a college instructor and student advisor, recommended breathing exercises like the ""4-7-8"" breath during stressful moments. And embrace the kids’ table, even if you've technically outgrown it: ""If you think the adults' table is going to be a thing that's going to make you crawl out of your skin, the kids' table is probably not going to be watching Fox News,"" Hill said. What if visiting family means seeing people who are hostile toward your identity? ""Queer, transgender, and gender non-conforming people often get put into the position of having to be educators versus getting to be guests at family gatherings,"" said McDaniel. ""There's tension between needing to be authentic and assertive and standing up for themselves versing wanting to make the visit 'peaceful and pleasant' and avoid 'drama,' which makes them feel like they have to be quiet and not stand up for themselves as much."" ""Discomfort is not harm,"" McDaniel reminds their clients. ""You're not harming your family by changing your name or asking them to use your correct pronouns; your identity is not 'causing a fight' or 'creating drama.'"" Still, they said to be realistic about what certain people are capable of. ""You're not going to be able to buy groceries at the hardware store, by which I mean, some people just are not going to be able to meet your needs."" But, McDaniel tells their clients, arguing with someone isn't the only way to stand up for yourself. “Quietly changing the subject can be authentic; leaving the room and taking a walk can be authentic."" Some families like to decide that this one day, in front of everyone, over a big meal on the good dishes, is when each returning young person must 1) account for everything they've been up to in the past year around career, studies, romantic partnerships, and body size and shape so the group can deem if sufficient progress toward acceptable milestones has been made, and 2) respectfully receive unsolicited advice about ""problems"" that are in the minds of their beholders. It's the worst to feel like you have to audition for the approval of and defend your life to people you rarely see (and why is that?, I wonder). Your family doesn't need to know every detail of your life just because they asked. Try deflecting with boring responses like ""Interesting, Grandma, I'll think about it,"" which is technically true for about two seconds as you continue to disagree, or, ""That's not my experience, but can you tell me what it was like when you were my age?"" This can disarm people who are just dying to unload on you by distracting them with the appearance of compliance while inviting them to talk about themselves. Instead of waiting to be quizzed, ask people anodyne questions like, ""Is there any TV you're loving lately?"" or, ""What's the most fun thing you did this year?"" When the ""big"" family conversation is contentious or irritating, feel free to be “rude” and start up side conversations with people you like. Chances are somebody else in that room also dreads the annual interrogation and will be grateful. Small talk can be annoying, but do you really want to have Big Talk with some of these people? Friend, u do not. One of McDaniel's favorite self-care habits is ""bookending"" trips in order to be more grounded and to decompress. ""This could mean setting up dinner before and after the trip with best friends, or doing something to take care of your body, like scheduling a favorite exercise class for the day you come back,"" they explained. ""Whatever makes you feel grounded in the life you created for yourself and makes you feel valued and supported by the community you can count on.""

2016-04-11 19:00:00,2016,4.0,11,"For the First Time, Scientists Have Imaged the Brain on LSD","Researcher, drug policy reformer, and Countess of Wemyss Amanda Feilding made a promise to Albert Hofmann, the ""father of LSD,"" after meeting him in the 90s: She would carry out scientific research with his ""problem child"" on human subjects by his 100th birthday in 2006. A study published on Monday makes good on that vow, albeit ten years late: For the first time, researchers have imaged the human brain on LSD. The study, published in PNAS, is the result of years of work conducted by researchers at Imperial College London and supported by the Beckley Foundation, which Feilding founded in 1998. It reveals some of the effects LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) has on the brain, and offers insight into how psychedelic drugs could both shed light on the fundamental nature of consciousness and be used as a therapeutic tool to treat psychological disorders such as depression and addiction. ""It's a very proud day for us and for British science really; we are the first to do this and it's very much a dream come true,"" said lead investigator Robin Carhart-Harris as he introduced the findings alongside Feilding and research co-director David Nutt at an event at the Royal Society. In this study, the researchers gave 20 volunteers an injection of 75 micrograms of LSD—an amount Carhart-Harris described as ""a moderate dose""—and imaged their brain while they were under the influence using two types of fMRI and a MEG scan. They also asked them questions about their experience on the drug, allowing them to draw correlations between the subjects' reports and their observed brain activity. The participants underwent the same experience with a placebo of saline. The volunteers all had some prior experience with psychedelics and were screened for mental and physical health to check they would tolerate being in the potentially anxiety-inducing position of having to lie still in an fMRI machine while on acid. The researchers ended up with 15 clear datasets, the rest discarded due to movement-related noise, and what they found offers insight into the brain mechanisms behind two definitive aspects of the psychedelic experience: visual hallucinations and effects on consciousness, and particularly what's known as ""ego dissolution"" or a breakdown of the sense of self as it's usually understood. Carhart-Harris highlighted the effects on consciousness as particularly interesting. ""Really, I think this is why psychedelics in general, but also LSD, are special,"" he said. ""They really alter consciousness in this very fundamental and unusual, novel way, and therefore they're very powerful tools to understand this major problem of 'what is the nature of consciousness?'"" The study revealed several interesting leads. In fMRI scans of subjects' brains on LSD, researchers found reduced communication between the parahippocampus and regions related to the sense of self such as the retrosplenial cortex. ""There's a kind of dislocation, if you want, in this circuit, and a disintegration in the system which underlies these functions,"" explained Carhart-Harris. Most importantly, the magnitude of this observed pattern correlated with subjects' ratings of the ego-dissolution effect. In their paper, the researchers compare their overview of results with studies on other psychedelics, such as psilocybin. ""It seems increasingly evident that psychedelics reduce the stability and integrity of well-established brain networks and simultaneously reduce the degree of separateness or segregation between them; that is, they induce network disintegration and desegregation,"" they write. Carhart-Harris explained this as the brain being less ""compartmentalized"" and more ""unified"" under psychedelics, functioning in a ""simpler"" or ""freer"" way. In the paper, he and his coauthors characterizes this phenomenon as brain activity becoming more ""entropic."" As for psychedelic visuals, the researchers observed an increase in blood flow in the visual cortex and increased communication between the visual cortex and other areas of the brain when on LSD. ""We also saw that the magnitude of this effect correlated with our volunteers' ratings of complex visual imagery,"" Carhart-Harris said. These findings may seem niche, but they add to a fundamental understanding of how the brain and consciousness works. By showing how LSD acts on the brain, they also bolster research into the therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs, which has lately seen something of a revival. In their conclusion, the researchers speculate that the ""entropic"" effects observed under LSD could help to disrupt psychiatric disorders in which the brain has ""become entrenched in pathology, such that core behaviors become automated and rigid."" Perhaps as remarkable as the study's results, however, is the fact that it was done at all. Since LSD became illegal in 1966, it's been very difficult to use the drug in scientific research. As a Schedule 1 drug in the UK, LSD is officially considered to have no therapeutic applications, which makes getting the required licences and ethics approvals to run trials with it particularly hard. (Fielding in particular is campaigning for it to be moved to Schedule 2.) The taboo around research with illegal drugs can also put off research institutions and make it hard to get funding. It even makes getting hold of the drugs difficult—they need to be specially made to a sufficient standard for a scientific trial, which is a costly process with its own set of regulations. Indeed, this imaging study was partly funded through a crowdfunding campaign. David Nutt, who is well-known for his criticism of UK drug policy, said the study was ""easily the most significant thing I've ever done."" He noted jovially that his much-publicised dismissal as a government drugs adviser in 2009 allowed him to help follow the vision of psychedelics research Feilding had previously presented. For her part, Feilding characterised the groundbreaking study as a ""coming-of-age"" of Hoffman's discovery. ""But for the taboo surrounding this field, he would, surely, have won the Nobel Prize,"" she said. She spoke of her own use of LSD after being introduced to it in the 60s, and her enduring aim ""to re-integrate these valuable compounds into the fabric of society, and to make their benefits available where appropriate."" There are of course many unanswered questions remaining, and the researchers are working on other studies with psychedelics, the most imminent being a clinical trial looking at the effects of psilocybin (magic mushrooms) in depressed patients. It's worth noting this was a small trial, and only involved participants who had previously used psychedelics, which could impact the results. Carhart-Harris also pointed out that it's difficult to measure things like ego dissolution, which is highly subjective. However, the team hopes that publishing this study will help open the floodgates for further research. Having published their findings in a highly-regarded journal and presented them in the eminent surroundings of the Royal Society, they want to push the impression that psychedelics research is not a fringe interest but a mainstream concern. ""I think we've now achieved something that, hopefully, is transformational,"" said Nutt. ""If you want to quote this, I will say to you that this, for human neuroscience, is the same as the discovery of the Higgs boson, because we have known for almost as long as we knew there was a Higgs boson that we needed to study the effects of LSD on the brain, but no one did it because the reputational risk was too oppressive.""

He couldn't see them -- the usually flat white sea ice was covered in water, the result of flooding from Greenland's ice sheet, the second largest on the planet.  The incredible photo he took, of sled dogs ankle deep in a wide expanse of light blue water, quickly went viral, destined to join pictures of starving polar bears, shrunken glaciers, stranded walruses and lakes turned bone dry in the pantheon of evidence of our ongoing climate catastrophe.  As Olsen said on Twitter, communities in Greenland -- mainly indigenous -- ""rely on the sea ice for transport, hunting and fishing."" They will be among the first affected by the melting of the ice sheet, but the repercussions will not remain limited to Greenland or even North America.  Greenland's ""melt season"" runs from June to August, with the bulk of melting occurring in July, the hottest month. But this year has already seen massive amounts of ice lost, with some 40% of Greenland experiencing melting on June 13 -- the day Olsen took his photo -- for a total melt of more than 2 billion tons of ice, according to recent estimations.  Scientists have been predicting a record year for melting on the Greenland ice sheet for months, and the amount of ice already being lost this early in the summer suggests they're right.  The effect is also cumulative -- the more ice lost early in the summer causes greater melting as the weeks go on. This is because white snow and ice reflect the sun's rays back into space, reducing the amount of heat absorbed and keeping the ice cold. The less ice there is, the less heat is reflected, and the more melting occurs.  Thomas Mote, a research scientist at the University of Georgia who studies Greenland's climate, told CNN last week that while previous melt periods occurred in 2007, 2010 and 2012, ""we didn't see anything like this prior to the late 1990s.""  This could have a major effect on sea level rise, one of the most dangerous effects of climate change that could drive millions of people living in coastal communities from their homes.  ""Greenland has been an increasing contributor to global sea level rise over the past two decades,"" Mote said, ""and surface melting and runoff is a large portion of that."" Since 1972, ice loss from Greenland alone has added 13.7 millimeters (about half an inch) to the global sea level, a recent study estimates. The island's ice sheet is the leading source of water added to the ocean every year. Just as an early melt in Greenland can cause more melting later in the year, the loss of ice can have an amplifying effect on global temperatures because less heat is reflected off the planet. That heat causes sea temperatures to rise, which then causes more ice to melt, causing a cycle that is only broken when winter arrives and the Arctic begins to freeze again.  But with winters becoming warmer and warmer as the global climate catastrophe continues, the risk is that one day the cycle doesn't stop or even slow, and instead of huskies in Greenland ankle deep in water, it'll be people in Manhattan. And that will only be the start of their problems.  CNN's Brandon Miller and Jen Christensen contributed reporting.

Photo:  Ken Gage (CDC)The city of angels is dealing with a nasty outbreak of a disease spread by fleas. Last Friday, California health officials reported that there has been an epidemic of flea-borne typhus within the  Los Angeles area this year.Typhus is an old disease, with recorded accounts dating back to the 14th century. There are several forms of typhus, but all are caused by a group of bacteria known as Rickettsia. Each form is primarily spread by a different insect or arachnid vector. Like many vector-borne diseases, typhus thrives in warm and tropical areas. The most serious form of typhus—spread by body lice—has killed millions of people throughout history, but nowadays, thanks to better sanitation and living conditions, as well as the discovery of antibiotics, it’s rarely seen in most of the world. Flea-borne typhus is more common and less serious, but in the U.S., it’s still only sporadically spotted in Southern states like Texas, California, and Hawaii.One of the hotspots for typhus in California is Pasadena, a city within Los Angeles County. According to the Pasadena Public Health Department, there have been at least 20 residents who have contracted the disease this year, a relatively dramatic rise from the one to five cases seen annually. There have also been more than 20 cases outside of Pasadena in the state, according to NBC News. And because typhus most often occurs in the summer and fall months, more cases could be on the way.The symptoms of typhus include fever, headache, nausea, and rash. Less commonly, it causes neurological symptoms like seizures or confusion. Though most people recover without medical help, flea-borne typhus can be fatal, especially if more severe symptoms go untreated. “Typhus fever is a disease that can cause serious complications requiring lengthy hospitalization, and rarely, death,” said Dr. Ying-Ying Goh, a Pasadena health official, in a statement. “All residents should to take steps to prevent fleas in and around the home.”Flea-borne typhus is also known as murine typhus—a reference to the fact that rats are the main host of the fleas that can spread the bacteria, Rickettsia typhi. But fleas that feed from pets and other feral animals like opossums can also spread it. These animals can put us in close contact with the fleas, who aren’t shy enough to turn down an opportune meal from people. We don’t get typhus from the flea’s bite, though. The fleas poop out the germ, which then gets into our system when it’s rubbed into skin wounds or our eyes.Health officials are still trying to figure out why typhus has been so common this year, though an especially warm year has likely contributed to the increase. The seeming rise of homelessness in areas like downtown Los Angeles might also explain some cases.“We’re deploying every available resource to help control and stop this outbreak,” a spokesperson for Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told NBC News. “The City and County have formed a dedicated task force through our Unified Homelessness Response Center to keep Angelenos safe, and ensure everyone gets the treatment they need as quickly as possible.”Both poverty and climate change, experts in vector-borne disease have warned, are sure to make diseases like typhus once again common throughout the U.S.[Pasadena Public Health Department via NBC News]",https://gizmodo.com/los-angeles-is-dealing-with-an-outbreak-of-flea-borne-t-1829603536,Health,Gizmodo,health,557
2016-05-10 00:00:00,2016,5.0,10,China's cigarette sales fall slightly after tobacco tax: WHO,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Cigarette sales in China fell slightly over the past year after a hike in tobacco taxes, the World Health Organization said on Tuesday, as the country works to suppress a habit with major healthcare costs. The world’s largest producer and consumer of cigarettes has stepped up its battle on smoking, despite persistent opposition from the tobacco industry. China has 300 million smokers and 740 million more who are exposed to secondhand smoke, state media have said. The number of cigarettes sold in China fell 3.3 percent in the year to March 2016 from the previous year, the WHO said in a statement. Sales of the cheapest cigarettes fell 5.5 percent over the period, the WHO added, signaling that the tax prompted poor smokers, in particular, to cut back on cigarette purchases. “This is good news, because it is people in the lowest socio-economic groups in China who are most profoundly affected by the health and economic burdens caused by smoking,” said Bernhard Schwartländer, the WHO representative in China. Last year, China hiked its wholesale tax rate on cigarettes to 11 percent from 5 percent, an increase the WHO said earned revenue of about 70 billion yuan ($11 billion) for the central government in 2015. Retail cigarette prices rose about 10 percent on average, with the cheapest brands becoming as much as a fifth more costly, a WHO analysis found. Anti-smoking campaigners in China have faced tough opposition from the state-owned tobacco monopoly, which wields great sway because it contributes an estimated 7 percent to 10 percent of government tax revenue. Two-thirds of young men in China take to smoking, mostly before the age of 20, and around half of them are eventually killed by the habit unless they quit, a study showed last year.

2018-08-31 00:00:00,2018,8.0,31,"Cataract surgery not tied to longer life for women, after all","(Reuters Health) - While older women may have a better quality of life and better vision after surgery to remove cataracts, newly reanalyzed data suggest they shouldn’t base their decision to have the surgery on whether it will help them live longer. In a paper last year in JAMA Ophthalmology, researchers concluded that women who opted for cataract surgery were 60 percent less likely to die from all causes during the study period than women who didn’t. Their findings were drawn from 74,044 women with cataracts, including 41,735 who underwent cataract surgery. But the authors retracted their paper last week, noting that they had failed to account for the time that lapsed between the diagnosis of cataracts and the surgery to remove them. Many news outlets, including Reuters, had reported on the now-retracted study. (reut.rs/2orCrmz) “With cataract surgery, there can be a 10- to 20-year delay between diagnosis and treatment because the surgery is elective,” senior study author Dr. Anne Coleman of the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles told Reuters Health by email. When researchers accounted for the time between diagnosis and surgery for women who got operations, and also for how long women with cataracts survived when they didn’t get surgery, the cataract surgery was now associated with a higher risk of death from all causes during the study period. “With this additional factor, it appears that not having surgery (is associated with) longer life, but it is not a cause-and-effect relationship,” Coleman said. “The decision to proceed with cataract surgery should be based on several factors related to visual and overall physical functioning, after a complete assessment and discussion between a patient and his or her family, caretakers, and cataract surgeon,” she said. From 1993 to 2013, 6,878 women in the study who had cataract surgery died, as did 6,123 women with cataracts who didn’t get the procedure, researchers reported in the original paper. Women in the study were 71 years old, on average, the original paper stated. They were participating in the Women’s Health Initiative, a long-running study that collects information on demographics, medical conditions and lifestyle habits. Cataracts often develop with age. By age 80 roughly half of Americans either have cataracts or have had cataract surgery, according to the National Eye Institute. With a cataract, the lens in the eye becomes cloudy and things look blurry or less colorful than they should. During cataract surgery, the damaged lens is removed and replaced with an artificial lens that helps restore clear vision. Several previous studies have linked cataract surgery to lower odds of premature death for both men and women, Coleman said. Cataracts can’t be prevented, but there are benefits to treating them, said Dr. Justine Smith, author of editorial published with the original study. However, the retraction illustrates the difficulty of trying to determine whether cataract surgery directly impacts how long people live, Smith, a researcher at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, said by email. “These events provide a great example of good science: good scientists are constantly re-evaluating their work, and are always interested to receive questions from other scientists about that work,” Smith said.

Bloomberg on Monday highlighted a couple features that it says are coming to those platforms. Software changes to iOS 13, reportedly named ""Yukon,"" are unlikely to be drastic enough to flip falling iPhone sales, but they may refine the experience for Apple's current customers. They could also be used to push the new digital services Apple recently announced, like a video game subscription service and streaming TV shows produced by Apple. Bloomberg reported Apple is planning to add a new ""dark mode"" to iOS 13, a feature that's already available for Macs that darkens different parts of the user interface so it's less harsh on eyes, particularly in the evening. The company is also reportedly planning a new feature that will allow people to use iPads as a secondary display when connected to a Mac. Other features include new multitasking for iPads, tweaks to iMessage that make it more like WhatsApp and a new Health app that ""better outlines your daily activity from the day,"" Bloomberg reported. Apple's iOS has improved steadily over the years, with recent releases focused on improving battery life and performance on older devices. The company's voice assistant Siri could use a big upgrade, but major changes to it weren't mentioned in the report. Since Apple always rolls out new features to older iPhones and iPads however, iOS upgrades don't usually drive new device sales.

2018-01-11 00:00:00,2018,1.0,11,"France blames Lactalis, retailers in deepening baby food scare","PARIS (Reuters) - France, seeking to limit reputational damage to its agri-business industry, threatened on Thursday to impose sanctions after the country’s big supermarkets said recalled baby foods made by Lactalis had still found their way onto shop shelves. The admissions by Carrefour (CARR.PA), Leclerc, Auchan and Systeme U deepened a salmonella health scare that began in early December when France’s consumer protection agency ordered the halt to sales and a global recall of products from a factory in northwest France. Three dozen children have fallen ill. The botched recall is particularly embarrassing for the government after President Emmanuel Macron pushed food exports during a state visit to China this week. Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire laid the blame squarely on Lactalis, one of the world’s largest dairy groups, and the retailers as he tried to stem the fallout from the scandal. “There has been unacceptable behavior, which should be punished,” he told a news conference. In a sign of how seriously France is taking the issue, Macron weighed in from Italy, also promising punishment for those responsible. Salmonella infections can be life-threatening, particularly for young children, and the recall risks damaging Lactalis in China, a fast-growing market for baby food and dairy products where consumers are highly sensitive after melamine-tainted baby milk led to the deaths of six children in 2008. That health scare caused distrust in locally produced infant formula and benefited foreign suppliers such as Nestle NESN.N, Danone (DANO.PA) and Lactalis. Privately-held Lactalis, which has annual sales of around 17 billion euros ($20 billion), addressed the salmonella contamination by halting operations at the factory where it started, and on Thursday announced the temporary layoff of 250 workers. The recall affected goods carrying the Picot, Milumel and Taranis brands destined for French and overseas markets and France’s consumer protection agency DGCCRF has begun an investigation and carried out 2,500 checks so far. A further 2,500 checks will be carried out from next week. Le Maire said initial checks showed recalled products had remained on sale at 91 sites in France, but there were no indications so far that potentially contaminated products had been exported. Just back from a three-day official visit to China with Macron, Le Maire said he had discussed the recall with his counterparts in Beijing, adding: “The best response is transparency”. Le Maire said the DGCCRF was forced to issue a Dec. 10 recall because Lactalis was too slow to take action. “The state took over from a company which failed in its actions,” he said. Lactalis rejected criticism of its response, saying it had collaborated closely with the authorities. “Our group has since the beginning behaved like a responsible company and of course it will continue to do so,” Michel Nalet, Lactalis’ head of communication, told reporters. Le Maire has summoned Lactalis for talks on Friday. The DGCCRF issued a first recall on Dec. 10 after Lactalis discovered salmonella contamination at its Craon factory, halting the sale of several baby food products made there. Lactalis announced an extension to the recall less than two weeks later, confirming that contamination occurred at Craon during work in the first half of the year. The recall included products aimed for export to some 30 countries, including to China, and overall represented more than 12 million baby food tins in what Nalet said was the biggest recall Lactalis had ever experienced. In a statement on Thursday, Carrefour said it had sold 434 products at risk of contamination since the Dec. 21 recall, but that another 95,000 had been successfully removed from shelves. Leclerc, France’s biggest food retailer, said this week it had sold 984 products involved in the recall. “We made mistakes, as did all the big distribution companies,” Systeme U spokesman Thierry Desouches told BFM TV, adding the recall had been complex. A French judicial investigation was launched in December and consumer protection association UFC-Que Choisir said it had filed a lawsuit against Lactalis for alleged fraud.

2019-02-04 00:00:00,2019,2.0,4,"Bud Light shames Miller, Coors for using corn syrup in Super Bowl ad","Anheuser-Busch used one of its Super Bowl ads to shame Bud Light rivals Miller Lite and Coors Light for using corn syrup to brew their beers, but dietitians say the sweetener isn't all that bad when used in the fermentation process. In the 60-second commercial, an order for corn syrup inadvertently shows up at the wrong castle. The Bud Light king takes an arduous journey up mountains and across the sea to deliver it to the Miller Lite and Coors Light castles, which both use corn syrup in their brewing processes. The ad prompted backlash from corn grower industry groups and Millers Lite and Coors Light, who are both owned by MillerCoors, the U.S. subsidiary of Molson Coors. Added sugars, especially high-fructose corn syrup, have come under intense scrutiny fueling an obesity epidemic that has left nearly 40 percent of U.S. adults obese. While corn syrup sounds pretty close to high-fructose corn syrup, it's actually quite different on the molecular level, Margaret Slavin, an associate professor in nutrition and food studies at George Mason University, told CNBC. Corn syrup is essentially corn starch that has been mostly broken down into single glucose molecules. To make high-fructose corn syrup, scientists use enzymes that change about half of those glucose molecules into fructose. The result is a sweeter substance that's cheaper to produce than regular sugar. Miller Lite and Coors Light use corn syrup to feed yeast in the brewing process. Yeast eats sugar, in this case corn syrup, and turns it into alcohol and carbon dioxide. Anheuser-Busch uses rice to feed the yeast when brewing Bud Light. Rice takes a little bit longer to digest because corn syrup is pre-digested, since the enzymes break it down, Slavin explains. The end result for both? Beer. ""I'm a little surprised at (corn syrup) being used in advertising in such a way,"" said Slavin, a registered dietitian. ""I think it's more playing on consumer hot topics and concerns than on a particular scientific concern whether or not they're using sugar or rice or some other refined grain to feed the yeast."" Nicole Lund, sports dietitian at NYU Langone, said one of her clients came in Monday asking her what she thought about the commercial and the implication that consumers should stay away from beer made with corn syrup. He said one of his friends prefers Coors Light and was a little nervous about drinking it. Like Slavin, Lund says the ad plays into consumer fears about high-fructose corn syrup and weight gain. Our bodies store whatever they haven't used for energy. Added sugars are typically found in foods we tend to overeat, like soda or candy, so they commonly get stored as fat, she said. However, it's not really an issue when sugars get mostly stripped out during the beer-making process, she said. ""With a lot of these trendy things, you have to take a step back and decide how big of an issue it is to your life, but for the most part, that's probably not somebody's biggest issue,"" Lund said. ""Especially if they're drinking six beers a day, it would probably be more about the quantity than which beer they're choosing."" MillerCoors, which makes Miller, Coors and a variety of other lagers and brews, agreed. In a post on its website titled ""About those Bud Light ads,"" Miller took a jab at its rival and explained why brewers use the syrupy sweetener. ""As Anheuser-Busch pointed out in a series of low-performing television spots aired during Sunday's football game, both Miller Lite and Coors Light use corn-derived sugars during fermentation,"" Miller said, adding that it ""aids in making them light-bodied, easy-drinking beers with reduced calories and carbohydrates."" It also said that none of the sugars make their way into the final product. Anheuser-Busch has been promoting its transparency efforts. In January, Bud Light became the first beer in the U.S. to start displaying ingredient labels. ""We don't have anything against corn syrup, we just don't use it in Bud Light,"" the company said in a statement. ""Consumers want transparency and we're providing it. Bud Light's Super Bowl commercials are only meant to point out a key difference in Bud Light from some other light beers.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/04/bud-light-shames-miller-coors-for-using-corn-syrup-in-super-bowl-ad.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,702
2017-09-15 10:41:24,2017,9.0,15,SoFi Board Says C.E.O. Is Out Immediately Amid Sexual Harassment Scandal,"Social Finance, a privately held online lender and technology start-up, said on Friday that Mike Cagney would step down immediately as chief executive, accelerating a departure announced this week amid a sexual harassment scandal. The board of the company, which is based in San Francisco and known as SoFi, said that Tom Hutton, the executive chairman, would be the interim chief executive and would take over day-to-day management responsibilities. Mr. Hutton, an initial SoFi investor, has been on the SoFi board since 2012. “The business is strong, stable and well-positioned,” Mr. Hutton said in a statement. “For now, there is no more important work than paving the way for future success by building a transparent, respectful and accountable culture.” Mr. Cagney, 46, said in a letter on Monday that he would leave his position at the end of the year amid a sexual harassment lawsuit, accusations that he had inappropriate relationships with company employees and questions about whether he had skirted risk and compliance controls. He did not respond to a request for comment. SoFi was founded in 2011 and bundles money from Wall Street investors into loans for students, home buyers and others. The company is valued at more than $4 billion and has raised $1.9 billion from venture investors, including Baseline Ventures, Discovery Capital and SoftBank. It recently began the process of applying for a banking license. SoFi was sued last month by a former employee who argued that sexual misconduct at the company had created a toxic work environment and that he had been fired for reporting sexual harassment to managers. SoFi disputed the accusations, but said it would investigate them. Mr. Cagney said in the letter he sent to SoFi employees on Monday that “the combination of HR-related litigation and negative press have become a distraction from the company’s core mission.” On Tuesday, The New York Times published an article examining Mr. Cagney’s stewardship of SoFi. The article included accusations from more than 30 current and former employees, who said he had treated women inappropriately and had aggressively taken on risk to accelerate the company’s growth. The article included details of a $75,000 settlement that SoFi reached with a former executive assistant at the company, Laura Munoz, who some people said had received sexually explicit text messages from Mr. Cagney. He was also seen holding hands and talking intimately with another female employee, which made employees uncomfortable. In addition, the article reported on a SoFi loan product that was sold to investors without being properly funded. The product was ultimately phased out, with investors being offered their money back or an opportunity to invest in a new product. They were not told about the funding shortfall. A SoFi spokesman told The Times for the article that the company had not taken on too much risk and that the board had investigated the dispute with Ms. Munoz in 2012 and had found no evidence of a romantic or sexual relationship. He declined to comment on other personal relationships involving Mr. Cagney and other employees, saying the company did not comment on personnel matters. The spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment on Friday. With Mr. Cagney’s abrupt departure, SoFi joins the ranks of technology start-ups that have had to contend with serious issues related to workplace culture. Other companies in that category include the blood testing start-up Theranos, the insurance start-up Zenefits and, perhaps most prominently, the ride-hailing company Uber, whose chief executive, Travis Kalanick, stepped down amid a spate of scandals. Like some of those companies, SoFi continues to grow quickly. The company said in a statement on Monday that it had funded $3.1 billion in loans in the second quarter of 2017, generating more than $134 million in revenue. It said it had lent more than $20 billion to more than 350,000 borrowers over the course of its history.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/technology/sofi-cagney-scandal.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,648
2018-12-16 20:13:00,2018,12.0,16,How Do You Cope With Fear of Death?," I was 26. I watched my fair complexion darken to grey, then black. The flesh fell off my skin in damp patches that were absorbed into the earth. Then I was bone. Those, too, deteriorated to fine grains that were picked up by the wind. And then I was not there. Where my body had been, there was only earth. This was a guided meditation on death, led by a Buddhist monk, that I attended in the early aughts. My response to it was visceral. Disgust. Dismay. Fear. On some level, I just didn’t get it. I was young and healthy and beautiful and I was pretty sure that I was not going to die anytime soon and even if I did, it would probably be in some horrible accident. I would never witness this gentle decay of my body or the reintegration of it into the earth. I filed that experience under WTF and never thought about it, which is what most of us do with thoughts of our own death. We don’t think about it. Or we think about it logistically and legally: Who will get my stuff and who will take care of my cats? The decay of our bodies is not our concern. It will be handled, chemically, by professionals. But our culturally-mandated avoidance of thinking about death might not be helping us. In fact, it might be hurting us. Thinking about death might make you happier. Read more about this phenomenon, and try a death meditation, because why the hell not? A: There are two types of phobias around death: necrophobia, which is the fear of dead things and things associated with the dead (funerals, cemeteries), and thanatophobia, which is the fear of one’s self dying. You can live a fulfilling life with either phobia if you have the right coping skills. A good starting place, if you can do it, is to find a therapist who has experience in treating anxiety and phobias. It can be helpful to understand where your particular fear of deathcomes from. Often there is a trauma associated with the fear, whether it be the loss of a loved one or having come close to dying yourself. Regardless, a therapist can tailor a treatment plan to you and your specific anxiety. Two things to try on your own: If you are in a situation where you are facing end-of-life care due to illness, it can be helpful to have conversations with your family about a plan, whether it’s about how long you’d like to be on life support or what kind of celebration or funeral you envision. Having a plan and knowing your wishes will be carried out can give you a sense of comfort and control. Thinking about death is scary—it’s final, and what comes after is unknown, whether you believe in an afterlife or not. Most of all, coming to terms with death being a part of life is important for moving past the fear.

The liquid crystal display (LCD) maker for smartphones, which gets more than half of its revenue from Apple, posted a net loss of 25.4 billion yen ($233 million) in the July-September quarter, wider than the 7.8 billion loss a year earlier. Japan Display, money-losing for the past five years due to slowing Apple iPhone sales and the delayed adoption of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens, did not give a full-year earnings outlook. But CEO Minoru Kikuoka, who took the helm in September, told an earnings briefing the company turned profitable in October. Japan Display is seeking to raise at least 50 billion yen ($470 million), having had to scramble after Chinese investment firm Harvest suddenly pulled out of a bailout plan. Of the planned bailout funds, Apple intends to invest $200 million, sources with direct knowledge of the talks have said. Hong Kong-based Oasis Management is likely to contribute $150-180 million, Japan Display has said.

2017-01-23 00:00:00,2017,1.0,23,The New White House Website Says Almost Nothing About Tech,"Prior to today's presidential inauguration, the official website of the president, Whitehouse.gov, was reset to reflect the new occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.: Donald Trump.  And while the largely barebones new site features language related to the new administration's energy, defense, trade, and job growth policies, it features scant information related to technology, a sector that directly affects all four. There are only two direct mentions of issues germane to the internet or technology: One, in the ""Making Our Military Strong Again"" subsection, is some boilerplate about the importance of cyberwarfare: Cyberwarfare is an emerging battlefield, and we must take every measure to safeguard our national security secrets and systems. We will make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities at our U.S. Cyber Command, and recruit the best and brightest Americans to serve in this crucial area. The second comes at the end of the biography page of first lady Melania Trump, and concerns her campaign against cyberbullying: Mrs. Trump cares deeply about issues impacting women and children, and she has focused her platform as First Lady on the problem of cyber bullying among our youth. That cyberwarfare and cyberbullying are the only two mentions of the internet or technology on the White House page is somewhat ironic, given revelations about Russian interference in the presidential election, and the scores of pro-Trump trolls that plagued social media during the campaign. There is no mention of automation —acknowledged by economists as a major threat to American jobs — or specific policies important to Silicon Valley, including the status of visas for high-tech workers, and a proposed one-time tax holiday on repatriation of foreign income to encourage big tech firms to bring money back into the US.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/23/the-new-white-house-website-says-almost-nothing-about-tech.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,289

""When we look at three to five years, we are long-term shareholders, we think this company has the potential to double again in that type of time frame,"" Mehra said Thursday on CNBC's ""Closing Bell."" Amazon's stock just after market open Thursday, marking a major milestone in its climb toward a $1 trillion market valuation. Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to reach that valuation in early August. Mehra, who is also a portfolio manager at Baron Capital, said cloud computing and advertising will be the major growth areas fueling Amazon's rise to $2 trillion. ""Advertising, for those of us who have been paying attention over the last few quarters, has really become a big driver,"" Mehra said. ""If you think about what that could be in three or more, in five years, that could be a $30 [billion] to $50 billion revenue business with very high margins."" Kim Caughey Forrest, Fort Pitt Capital Group analyst and portfolio manager, says other major companies will attempt to slow Amazon's growth, particularly when it comes to advertising revenue. To combat that, Amazon needs to learn to merchandise, she said. ""Amazon really is a convenience store; it is not a place I like to dilly-dally and shop,"" she said. ""To really become a compelling long-term retailer, you have to learn how to merchandise. That's a big question mark."" Another ""question mark,"" Caughey Forrest stressed, is AWS. She said rivals, such as Microsoft, already have a large install base using their tools and services, so it just makes sense for those customers to migrate their business to Microsoft's cloud. ""I think that's a real competition for the company. They're going to have to step it up and spend a whole lot more on tools and ancillary products you need whenever you are moving your business to the cloud in a meaningful way,"" she said. But Mehra remained bullish on the transformative power of Amazon's cloud and advertising businesses. To get an idea of where Amazon could be in five years, Mehra said, just look at the business five years ago. ""The overall profitability of Amazon, when you compare it versus five years ago, if you just looked at the retail business, it's completely different. So the profitability is really inflecting at Amazon over this year and next year,"" he said. At the moment, Mehra and Baron Capital aren't advocating to buy more shares of Amazon, but he said Amazon has ""a lot more upside.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/30/amazon-could-double-its-value-in-three-to-five-years-analyst-says.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,447
2016-04-13 00:00:00,2016,4.0,13,Sean Parker sets up $250 million cancer immunotherapy collaboration,"(Reuters) - A $250 million grant from Silicon Valley billionaire Sean Parker, announced on Wednesday, aims to speed development of more effective cancer treatments by fostering collaboration among leading researchers in the field. The Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy will include over 40 laboratories and more than 300 researchers from six key cancer centers: New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering, Stanford Medicine, the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of California, San Francisco, Houston’s University of Texas MD Anderson and the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. “Any breakthrough made at one center is immediately available to another center without any kind of IP (intellectual property) entanglements or bureaucracy,” Parker, the co-founder of music-sharing website Napster and the first president of Facebook, told Reuters in an interview. The institute will focus on the emerging field of cancer immunotherapy, which harnesses the body’s immune system to fight cancer cells. Recently approved drugs such as Yervoy and Opdivo from Bristol Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co Inc’s Keytruda have helped some patients sustain remission. But those first-generation therapies do not work for everyone, and scientists are trying to understand how to make them more effective. “Very little progress has been made over the last several decades,” Parker said, referring to cancer drug research. “Average life expectancy has only increased three to six months with some of these drugs that cost billions to develop.” The institute has identified three key areas of research - modifying a patient’s own immune system T-cells to target a tumor; studying ways to boost patient response to current immunotherapy drugs; and research to identify other novel targets to attack a tumor. Parker said the current system of cancer drug development discouraged the kinds of risk-taking that could lead to a major breakthrough. The new institute “is paradigm shifting,” said Dr. Jedd Wolchok, chief of the melanoma and immunotherapeutics unit at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. He said it would alleviate the need for scientists to secure grants, which he said took up at least 30 percent of his time, foster collaboration among accomplished scientists and provide access to the newest information processing and data technology. “I have no doubt this will allow us to make progress, and to make it much more quickly,” Wolchok said. The Parker Institute aims to ensure members can easily share research discoveries and tools, as well as jointly conduct clinical trials with standardized data collection and operations. Parker said the aim was to maximize the return on investment by holding off on licensing deals until later in the research process, or even after a drug has been approved by regulators. Any profits would be funneled back into the institute. Patented discoveries made by the cancer center researchers will be shared 50-50 with the institute. A committee with members from each cancer center as well as representatives of the Parker Institute will review potential licensing deals. Jeff Bluestone, a professor at UCSF and an early researcher of immunotherapy, was appointed president of the Parker Institute. Parker credited his late friend Laura Ziskin, a Hollywood producer known for such films as “Pretty Woman” and founder of Stand Up To Cancer, with raising his awareness of the need to overhaul cancer research. She died of the disease in 2011. “Losing Laura transformed me,” he said.

2017-06-27 15:53:00,2017,6.0,27,The iPhone Has Objectified Our Faces,"  Motherboard staff is exploring the cultural, political, and social influence of the iPhone for the 10th anniversary of its release.   Follow along. iPhones have fundamentally changed what we expect from a smartphone. But how have they changed the way that we think about ourselves—specifically, with respect to our faces? One could argue that the design of the iPhone and its most popular apps spurred the popularization of what some—often Baby Boomers—like to call ""selfie culture.""  Several face-altering apps launched in 2010 alongside the iPhone 4, taking advantage of the iPhone's then-new front-facing camera. Fatbooth was one of the first popular face-altering apps.  Jenna Drenten, a professor of communications at Loyola University Chicago who has written about Fatbooth and social media, says that face-altering apps reflect the way that we want—and don't want—to be perceived by others. They promote the idea that features like wrinkles or pimples are inherently negative physical features. ""Apps like AgingBooth and FatBooth just perpetuate existing social stigmas that being old or being overweight are bad and should be laughed at,"" she told me in an email. ""When we use face-altering apps to edit our images, we are often more concerned with how other people see us than with embracing who we truly are."" FatBooth has fallen into relative obscurity over the years, but Drenten doesn't think this is because we've become any less resistant to fat-shaming. ""Apps like Snapchat and now Facebook are integrating similar face-altering features into their platforms,"" she said. ""Consumers already use Snapchat religiously, so using an additional app like Fatbooth is unnecessary. It has been pushed out of the market by competitors.""  In 2013, facial retouching app Facetune launched alongside the iPhone 6. According to its description in the App Store, the app has features that ""refine your smile,"" ""remove temporary imperfections,"" and give your eyes a ""penetrating gaze."" I spoke with Itai Tsiddon, one of the founders of Facetune, about the social impact of the app. He said that Facetune ""democratizes"" features normally available on professional editing softwares such as Photoshop and makes them available to any iPhone user.  ""You could argue, 'Oh, now everyone feels the need to retouch their photos before they post them,'"" he told me on the phone. ""But think about photos of Jennifer Aniston or famous, pretty, rich people. They always get retouched anyway—unlike you and me—and their stuff gets posted.""  James Charles, a makeup and beauty Youtuber with 1.2 million subscribers, is the creator of an instructional Facetune video called ""HOW TO TAKE YOUR SELFIES FROM DRAB TO FAB! FACETUNE TUTORIAL,"" which has almost 700,000 views. ""I don't know why recently people have been getting so surprised and called out for [Facetuning], when it's been something that's been going on literally since the beginning of time,"" Charles said in the video. ""Everybody edits their photos, and I guarantee, probably half of you watching have probably Facetuned yourselves on your phones as well."" There are growing concerns about the social impact of retouching apps such as Facetune. Bob Bednar, a media professor at Southwestern University, believes that Facetune indeed ""democratizes"" the ability to tune your face, but we can no longer assume that photographs reflect reality. ""In the larger visual culture, every one of us now is a person, but also has multiple visual selves circulating in different virtual environments,"" he said. ""What does it mean to be in a world where there's hundreds and hundreds of images floating around of ourselves in the ether while our body is always in one place at one time? There's always all these other images of ourselves."" I asked him what the popularity of facial retouching apps such as Facetune says about how we use our iPhones.  ""It implies that we see iPhones as both mirrors and as projection tools,"" he said. ""We want to look at them and show ourselves to ourselves, but I think the whole point of it is that we have access to all these different platforms where we want to show the world something constantly. We can do it instantly with the same device that we took the picture on, just tune it quickly, and move on."" Facetune is just one of many popular facial retouching apps. Meitu is a face-editing and retouching app developed by a Chinese company of the same name. It was available to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean users as early as 2013.  When it became available to English speakers in January 2017, taking over social media feeds for a couple of days. You may have seen these oddly unsettling pictures of people like Hillary Clinton and Mark Zuckerberg grace us on Twitter: The consensus seemed to be that the app makes you look like an anime or manga character. But the app doesn't enhance your eye size—the trademark feature of faces in anime/manga artistry. (Nevermind the fact that it was created by Chinese app developers, and anime/manga is a Japanese art form.) However, Meitu does give faces the air-brushed appearance of being drawn by an artist. It also lightens your skin, and Motherboard has written about how this aesthetic reflects East Asian beauty norms. Meitu spokesperson Vivi Zhou told me that ""Meitu"" has become verb in the same sense as ""Photoshop."" ""We strive to create value for our users through making the sharing of beauty more intelligent,"" she said to me in an email. ""Meitu is not only used as a verb for 'enhancing images,' but it also represents beauty, trendiness and youthfulness.""  According to Loyola's Drenten, Meitu reflects cultural stereotypes of beauty and pressures social media users to conform to these stereotypes. ""Our phones now offer mini-makeovers in the palms of our hands, but as we use them, we're creating and perpetuating unrealistic beauty ideals,"" she said. ""Using apps to alter your appearance can offer opportunities for empowerment, creativity, and experimentation. However, they can also negatively affect consumer well-being."" Even if you have not used Facetune or Meitu, you have almost definitely used Snapchat's ""Lenses"" feature—or ""filters,"" as most people call them. Lenses launched in September 2015 after Snapchat acquired Ukrainian facial tracking and modification app Looksery for $150 million. Clearly, Snapchat saw a market for people hoping to alter their appearance in real time.  Some of the Lenses—like the ones that engorge your eyes and lips to ridiculous sizes—are obviously meant to be used in jest. But many of the lenses incorporate airbrushing and real-time retouching that make us less shy about showing our faces to our friends. For instance, the infamous ""dog/puppy"" lens also airbrushes your face and covers your nose. A spokesperson for Snap, Inc. told me that Lenses were meant to be a creative tool of self-expression. But according to actual Lens users on social media, using Lenses isn't just an act of self-expression, but one of insecurity, boredom, and generally beautifying one's reality. Snap said that although Looksery describes itself as a ""facial tracking"" app, it's powered by object recognition, not facial recognition. In other words, it registers your face as an object, but it can't recognize  you by your face.  This may comfort people who have heard the unfounded conspiracy theory that Snapchat is building a facial recognition database and selling that data to third parties. Personally, I think that facial ""object recognition"" supports an idea that there is a virtual version of our faces that no one—not even our iPhones—can recognize.  According to Southwestern University's Bednar, the iPhone has not only created virtual versions of ourselves, but completely changed the way we visually communicate. As time goes on, he believes that the iPhone will continue to change our visual culture in different ways.  ""When [the iPhone was originally released], it was, 'Well, anyone can be a filmmaker. Anyone can be a photographer,'"" Bednar told me. ""Now, it's 'How do you participate in the culture that surrounds you?' To be in this culture means not only that you photograph and share, but that you've gotta perfect the photographs before you share them or you might as well not take them.""",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mbj8z4/the-iphone-has-objectified-our-faces,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,1337

In a series of tweets on Sunday, the activist and actress, 33, shared a new poster for her NBC show The Good Place, in which her “backfat” is clearly visible. “Finally able to INSIST my image, even on billboards isn’t ever airbrushed,” she wrote alongside the photo. “I get backfat in Every. Single. Bra. And I used to hide/bin so many photos because of ‘muffin tops.’ Double chins/ ‘imperfections’ because I never saw them on people on TV. #freethebackfat #letabitchlive.” I know it’s hard because we are perpetually scrutinized and criticized in this industry, but I’m begging other influencers, actors, and models to join me in not allowing airbrushing. We have to stop setting standards for others that we ourselves don’t even meet. #letabitchlive ❤️ https://t.co/Z3t88YOO5J — Jameela Jamil 🌈 (@jameelajamil) August 10, 2019  Jamil, who stars on the cover of Meghan Markle’s guest-edited issue of British Vogue, explained that by conquering this industry norm, she was empowering herself and paying tribute to her younger teenage self, who suffered from an eating disorder and body dysmorphia. “I’m aware this isn’t some huge victory, and not ‘brave’ but as someone who had such obsessive body dysmorphia and was so fixated on the embarrassment of what we perceive as ‘flaws’ this is just a little win for little anorexic teenage me,” she said. The Good Place star then went on to ask others in the spotlight to consider doing the same to help break the cycle of an unattainable beauty standard. “I know it’s hard because we are perpetually scrutinized and criticized in this industry, but I’m begging other influencers, actors, and models to join me in not allowing airbrushing,” she urged. “We have to stop setting standards for others that we ourselves don’t even meet.” In response to Jamil’s photos, some fans began sharing their own images that they’ve kept hidden because of certain bodily imperfections that they saw. “Thank you!  Seeing celebrities with ‘imperfections’ means the world. Here’s a wedding photo I really love but have kept hidden for over a year because the back fat AND double chin..,” one fan wrote. “It deserves to be seen with all the perfectly posed ones too. #freethebackfat.” Jamil previously told PEOPLE that her own experience as a young girl, when she suffered from anorexia, has inspired her to take action. “I was a teenager in the ’90s when all of the actresses were skeletally thin,” she said in April. “We were trying to literally emulate famine, which was going on in the world at that time. That was the look of iconic beauty. I starved myself for years. I didn’t have my periods for years. I hurt my fertility. I hurt my bones. I hurt my internal organs. My digestive system has never really recovered, nor has my thyroid, nor has my metabolism.” Jamil added: “All I’m trying to do is protect young people because they are so easily influenced. Celebrity has taken over from religion. Celebrities are the new deities, therefore we have too much power and too much influence. It has to be handled more responsibly than it is currently.”",https://people.com/health/jameela-jamil-back-fat-call-on-others-stop-airbrushing-photos/,health,People,health,533

The country, in the Horn of Africa, has long suffered from weak central government, fighting among clan warlords and terrorist acts committed by Al Shabab, an Islamic militant group with some factions aligned with Al Qaeda. In 1993, the capital, Mogadishu, was the scene of the “Black Hawk Down” battle between United States Army Rangers and clan militias. American troops sent to protect food aid shipments ended up fighting the warlords who were seizing them. The world’s largest refugee camp complex in Dadaab, Kenya, contains 260,000 Somali refugees who fled the civil war in the 1990s or subsequent floods and famine. Now about three million people in Somalia face starvation caused by a long drought. Last week, the United Nations said its appeal for $864 million in aid had raised less than a third of that amount. Making matters worse, cholera is spreading, attacking people already weakened by malnutrition. “Ever since the drying up of the Shabelle and Juba Rivers, people have been forced to move out to seek water and food in unfamiliar places,” said Dr. Abdinasir Abubakar, a cholera expert in the World Health Organization’s health emergencies program and leader of the campaign to deploy 900,000 doses of cholera vaccine supplied by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. The two rivers, both originating in Ethiopia, are normally Somalia’s only perennial streams, and the flood plain between them is the country’s breadbasket. Many wells have run dry, Dr. Abubakar added, so people drink from whatever puddles they can find, which may be contaminated by feces-borne diseases, including cholera. In 2015, the country had 15,619 known cholera cases and 548 deaths; this year it has already had over 13,000 cases and 333 deaths, Dr. Abubakar said. Cholera patients’ lives can be saved by intravenous feeding, oral rehydration and antibiotics. But that requires huge treatment wards. “There are very few humanitarian agencies and staff to support cholera response activities,” Dr. Abubakar said, so vaccination may be the only way to slow the spread.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/health/cholera-somalia-vaccination-campaign.html,health,The New York Times,health,366

The Vivo Nex 2, rumored for release in December, would be the successor to the Nex S phone which popularized the pop-up selfie camera. Similar to the Nubia X, the Nex 2 reportedly features a dual-screen design in an apparent attempt to maximise the screen-to-body ratio of the front display.

2018-04-30 00:00:00,2018,4.0,30,U.S. appellate judges seem divided on gene editing patents decision,"(Reuters) - U.S. appeals court judges appear divided over whether to allow a research center affiliated with MIT and Harvard to keep patents potentially worth billions of dollars on a groundbreaking gene editing technology known as CRISPR. Patents on the technology that could revolutionize treatment of genetic diseases and crop engineering are held by the Broad Institute, which was challenged in court by a rival team associated with the University of California at Berkeley and University of Vienna in Austria. Their lawyers argued at a hearing on Monday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington that the Broad Institute’s contributions were obvious and that an administrative court decision allowing Broad’s patents to stand should be reversed. One of the three judges hearing the case said she will likely side with Broad and affirm the administrative court, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). The two others judges did not say how they would rule. The court did not say when it would publish a decision. “Based on the oral arguments today, we are even more confident the Federal Circuit will affirm the PTAB’s judgment and recognize the contribution of Broad, MIT and Harvard in developing this transformative technology,” Broad said in a statement. Berkeley said in a statement that “based on the questioning today, we are optimistic that the court has serious doubts about several aspects of the PTAB’s decision.” In 2012, researchers at Berkeley and Vienna jointly applied for the first CRISPR patent. A team at Broad applied for a patent months later, opting for a fast-track review process. It became the first to obtain a CRISPR patent in 2014, and has since obtained additional patents. In 2015, Berkeley and Vienna petitioned PTAB to launch a so-called interference proceeding, claiming the Broad patents covered the same invention as their earlier application. Broad countered that its patent represented the real breakthrough because it described the use of CRISPR in so-called eukaryotic cells, which include plant and animal cells. PTAB said in a February 2017 decision that there was “no interference” between Berkeley and Vienna’s application and Broad’s patents, meaning both can be granted. That decision has created confusion over which institutions are entitled to royalties for commercial applications of CRISPR in the biotechnology and agriculture industries.

New mom Autumn Lampkins said in her lawsuit that management and fellow employees made it so difficult to pump during her long shifts that her breast milk dried up, according to The News Journal. When Lampkins was hired to be an assistant manager at a Camden location of KFC just a few months after giving birth in 2014, she was told that it would not affect her need to breastfeed. But she immediately had to work 10-hour training sessions with just one break, which didn’t allow her to pump every two hours, as her doctors recommended. At first, Lampkins pumped in a single-stall restroom, but she was later instructed to instead pump in the manager’s office, which had a surveillance camera that she was told they could not turn off. Once she completed her training, Lampkins was moved to a KFC in Dover where she was soon demoted to a shift supervisor, and dealt with insubordination from her co-workers who complained that she got too many “breaks” to breast pump, she said in the lawsuit. Lampkins said that the experience caused physical pain and led her to switch her baby to formula far sooner than she had planned. A jury agreed with Lampkins’ claims of workplace discrimination and awarded her $25,000 in compensatory damages and $1.5 million in punitive damages. “It was a great and long-fought victory,” one of her attorneys, Patrick Gallagher of Wilmington law firm Jacobs & Crumplar P.A., told The News Journal. “It’s a great day for women’s rights. The jury sent a message that employers cannot treat lactating women differently in the workplace.”",https://people.com/health/former-kfc-employee-wins-lawsuit-breastfeeding-discrimination/,health,People,health,296
2020-02-06 00:00:00,2020,2.0,6,SpaceX rival OneWeb launches 34 more internet satellites,"New York (CNN)A rocket blazed into space Thursday afternoon carrying 34 OneWeb satellites. It's the latest sign that 2020 will be a year in which new devices are deployed into Earth's orbit at an unprecedented pace as OneWeb and rival SpaceX race to make global broadband a reality.  The OneWeb satellites launched from Kazakhstan at 4:42 pm ET Thursday (Friday morning local time) atop a Russian-made Soyuz rocket. OneWeb purchased the rocket from Arianespace, an aerospace company based in France. Thursday's launch is expected to be the first of 10 that OneWeb will execute this year as it grows its constellation of internet-beaming satellites to more than 300 devices, the company's CEO, Adrian Steckel, told CNN Business. Each of the launches will carry at least 34 satellites, according to the company. Before Thursday, OneWeb operated just six satellites that were launched nearly a year ago. Steckel said they have performed better than expected,"" demonstrating speeds that could rival 5G internet. The firm has spent the past 11 months figuring out how to mass produce its satellites at its sprawling facility in Florida.  Steckel said OneWeb and its manufacturing partner, Airbus (EADSF), had to iron out issues in their production system and supply chain. But now that those issues are resolved, he estimates satellites will be rolling off assembly lines smoothly for the remainder of the year, and a second batch of more than 30 satellites will be ready for flight as soon as March. Only one other company is manufacturing telecommunications satellites on such a large scale: Elon Musk's SpaceX. The company is building its own constellation of internet satellites that already includes more than 200 devices and is expected to grow to more than 1,500 over the next 11 months. SpaceX and OneWeb are both basing their satellite internet businesses on the same ethos: rather than connecting people using traditional ground-based technologies — such as cables and cell towers, which still don't reach billions of people around the globe — a hive of satellites orbiting a few hundred miles up can blanket the entire planet in high-speed internet service. OneWeb plans to officially open for business in 2021. It will begin by selling services to governments and corporate customers that provide internet service to airplanes, ships and boats. Eventually, the company will sell bandwidth to consumer internet providers, such as Comcast and Verizon, said Steckel, OneWeb's CEO. SpaceX, which is aiming to start offering its broadband service as soon as mid-2020, is taking a different approach. It hopes to bring internet service straight to consumers, competing directly with traditional internet service providers. The coming months will be crucial: The companies will burn through massive amounts of cash as they build and launch hundreds of satellites — and OneWeb will do it all without bringing in a dime of revenue. That can be a tough pill to swallow, Steckel acknowledged. ""We are taking our money and doing something very exciting, the problem is that it seems intangible because [our assets] are flying around in space,"" Steckel, the CEO, said. ""But really we're investing in infrastructure."" OneWeb's largest backer is Softbank (SFTBF), the Japanese investing giant, which was hammered last year by ill-fated bets on startups, including Uber and WeWork. Softbank is reportedly putting more pressure on its portfolio of companies to cut costs and turn profits. But Steckel denied that OneWeb has felt pressure from Softbank. ""We're extremely pleased about the support we've gotten,"" he said. ""They understand we're not like other companies."" OneWeb's other investors include Coca-Cola (KO), Airbus (EADSF) and Virgin Group. The startup has raised a total of about $3.4 billion, Steckel said. Financial questions aside, however, the sheer number of satellites that OneWeb, SpaceX and others are deploying presents daunting questions about how to avoid collisions in space. Two orbital objects ramming into each other can have disastrous implications: Each piece of shrapnel from such a collision becomes uncontrollable garbage, and at orbital speeds, something smaller than a thumb tack could blow a hole into another critical satellite. OneWeb and SpaceX both say they are committed to preventing such disasters. Among the steps OneWeb says it is taking, for example, is to outfit its satellites with grappling hooks. The hooks could allow a cleanup spacecraft to latch on to a defunct OneWeb satellite and drag it out of orbit.

2016-08-22 00:00:00,2016,8.0,22,Indian doctors remove 40 knives from man's stomach,"New Delhi (CNN)A man in India spent two months swallowing knives and had 40 of them surgically removed from his stomach, according to the doctor who led the operation. ""He had a wild urge to consume metal. Even for us, the experienced surgeons, it was frightening,"" Dr. Jatinder Malhotra told CNN.  ""We were so nervous... a small mistake could have taken the patient's life. In my 20 years of practice, I have never seen anything like it."" Malhotra said it took his team about two days to form a diagnosis and surgery plan. The five-hour operation took place Friday in the northern Indian city of Amritsar, a Sikh holy city in the state of Punjab. Malhotra said they found foldable knives, which when fully extended were about seven inches long. ""He [the patient] says he swallowed some knives folded, and some unfolded. When we took out the knives -- some were found folded, some were open, and some had even started rusting and were broken,"" Malhotra said.  The patient, a 42-year-old father of two, told CNN he's feeling much better. ""I'm sorry I let my family down. I'll be forever thankful to doctors and hospital staff for saving my life,"" he said. Malhotra says the patient is now ""out of danger"" and is set to be discharged in a couple of days.  He won't be discharged until he's cleared by psychiatrists, which is set to happen in a couple of days, two doctors at the hospital told CNN. 'Try spinach' But the big question remains -- why did he start eating knives? ""I don't know why I used to swallow knives,"" the patient told CNN. ""I just enjoyed its taste and I was addicted ... how people get addicted to alcohol and other things, my situation was similar."" Malhotra believes the patient has a very rare mental disorder that most likely has not been published in any international medical journal. The patient is currently under the continuous supervision of the hospital's in-house psychiatric team and will soon be visited by independent mental health experts, doctors said. The patient told doctors that he has no idea why he started eating knives but that he ""developed a taste for metal"" and ""loved the way blades tasted."" The patient even managed to keep his habit secret from his family, according to Malhotra. Now, Malhotra says, the patient claims he won't even touch a knife anymore. ""I will never do such acts ever again,"" the patient said. ""I'm a new person now."" If the urge does strike, Malhotra and his team gave him some advice -- ""we told him if you ever feel like you need more iron in your body, try spinach.""

This year, CNBC was able to escape the crowds for a bit by traveling to higher ground: the Salesforce Tower. At 1,070 feet tall, the tower dwarfs other buildings in the vicinity and is the tallest office building on the West Coast. It has 61 floors and elevators that can zip visitors to the top in 39 seconds, fast enough to make our ears pop. The Wilshire Grand in Los Angeles is technically taller, at 1,100 feet, but includes a 166-foot spire on top, while the Salesforce Tower has no spire. The floor is still under construction. It has floor-to-ceiling windows that offer 360-degree views of the city. We were able to spot the Bay Bridge, Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz during our visit. Instead of executive offices, Salesforce says it will use the top floor as an events space, which will be open to employees as well as non-profits and NGOs. Salesforce is the building's anchor tenant and will occupy floors three to 30, 39 to 44, and the top two levels. The building is owned by Boston Properties and Hines.

2018-11-08 00:00:00,2018,11.0,8,Yoga and meditation on the rise among US adults and kids," (CNN)More Americans are turning to forms of complementary medicine such as yoga, meditation and chiropractors, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics.  The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, part of the National Institutes of Health, says in reports released Thursday that more than 30% of US adults and about 12% of children use ""healthcare approaches that are not typically part of conventional medical care or that may have origins outside of usual Western practices.""  Complementary medicine is when these practices are used alongside conventional medicine.  ""Many people turn to complementary health approaches, such as yoga and meditation, in order to help with symptom management, such as pain. As well, they turn to these approaches for a general sense of wellbeing,"" Richard Nahin, the lead epidemiologist at the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health and co-author of the reports, wrote in an email.   The reports, which were compiled using data from the National Center for Health Statistics' National Health Interview Survey, looked at the use of yoga, meditation and chiropractors between 2012 and 2017.  The practice of yoga rose from 3.1% of the overall child population in 2012 to 8.4% in 2017 and from 9.5% to 14.3% in adults, equating to about 4.9 million children and 35.2 million adults doing yoga in 2017. Meditation use went up from 0.6% of children in 2012 to 5.4% in 2017 and from 4.1% of adults in 2012 to 14.2% of adults in 2017. The use of chiropractors in children stayed essentially the same -- about 3.5% of children visited chiropractors in both years. There was a small difference for adults, from 9.1% in 2012 to 10.3% in 2017. More females are doing yoga in both age groups in 2017: 11.3% of girls, compared with 5.6% of boys, and 19.8% of women, compared with 8.6% of men.  Meditation and chiropractors were more popular with adult women surveyed, but in children, the rates of use between boys and girls were similar.  Among children, those between 12 and 17, were the most likely to either meditate or visit a chiropractor.  For adults, yoga was found to be most popular with 18- to 44-year-olds, and meditation and chiropractors were used most by those in the 45-to-64 age group.  Racially, white non-Hispanics were the most likely to use all three methods in both age groups.  Though the patterns of use were the same as in previous years for children, according to the report, there were changes in adult usage.  ""The popularity of meditation surpassed that of seeing a chiropractor to become the second most-used approach among those examined in 2017,"" the report said.   All three methods of complementary medicine appear to have health benefits, Nahin said. Yoga may improve general well-being, and evidence is increasing that it helps with some aspects of wellness, including mental health and stress management. It can also helps relieve lower back and neck pain.  He also noted that research suggests that meditation can help with medical problems, including symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and that the spinal manipulation of chiropractic research could help low back pain as well as problems such as whiplash-associated disorders.

SoftBank's stock ended Thursday's session in Japan at 9,962.0 yen per share, a 17.73 percent gain over its last close at 8462.0. Son owned 231,205,000 shares in the Japanese conglomerate as of Sept. 30, 2018, according to the company's website. If that number is still accurate, then that would mean Thursday's stock move made Son about 346.81 billion yen ($3.15 billion) richer. The massive gains on Thursday came after SoftBank Group announced what one investor called an ""enormous"" stock buyback on Wednesday. SoftBank Group said it would repurchase 112 million shares worth 600 billion yen (approx $5.46 billion) in the next 11 months, or about 10.3 percent of its total outstanding shares, excluding treasury stock. That came as the company announced a more than 50 percent surge in its net income for the first three quarters of the fiscal year. SoftBank has been thrust into the spotlight in recent years as a result of its Vision Fund, which has shaken up the global technology landscape.

2018-11-09 00:00:00,2018,11.0,9,U.S. to restrict e-cigarette flavors to fight teenage vaping 'epidemic',"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration next week will issue a ban on the sale of fruit and candy flavored electronic cigarettes in convenience stores and gas stations, an agency official said, in a move to counter a surge in teenage use of e-cigarettes.  The ban means only tobacco, mint and menthol flavors can be sold at these outlets, the agency official said, potentially dealing a major blow to Juul Labs Inc, the San Francisco-based market leader in vape devices.  The FDA also will introduce stricter age-verification requirements for online sales of e-cigarettes. The FDA’s planned restrictions, first reported by The Washington Post and confirmed to Reuters by the official, do not apply to vape shops or other specialty retail stores.  There has been mounting pressure for action after preliminary federal data showed teenage use had surged by more than 75 percent since last year, and the FDA has described it as an “epidemic”.  “E-cigs have become an almost ubiquitous ‒ and dangerous ‒ trend among teens,” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in September. “The disturbing and accelerating trajectory of use we’re seeing in youth, and the resulting path to addiction, must end. It’s simply not tolerable.”   That growth has coincided with the rise of Juul, whose sales of vaping devices grew from 2.2 million in 2016 to 16.2 million devices last year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The agency threatened in September to ban Juul and four other leading e-cigarette products unless their makers took steps to prevent use by minors. The FDA gave Juul and four big tobacco companies 60 days to submit plans to curb underage use, a compliance period that is now ending.  The planned restrictions on flavors in convenience stores are likely to have the biggest impact on Juul, which sells nicotine liquid pods in flavors such as mango, mint, fruit and creme, previously called creme brulee.  The only other e-cigarette competitors sold at convenience stores are those marketed primarily by tobacco companies such as Altria Group Inc, British American Tobacco Plc, Imperial Brands Plc and Japan Tobacco Inc.  Those products, sold under the MarkTen, blu, Vuse and Logic brands, have lost market share as Juul has risen to prominence over the last year, growing from 13.6 percent of the U.S. e-cigarette market in early 2017 to nearly 75 percent now, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of Nielsen retail data.  E-cigarette products represent a small share of revenue for major tobacco companies, whereas Juul’s business is built entirely on the vaping devices. Revenue from e-cigarette devices made up less than 1 percent of British American Tobacco’s global revenue for the first six months of 2018, according to a company filing from July.  Tobacco company shares were mixed on Friday. Imperial Brands closed up 2 percent, Altria was down slightly and Japan Tobacco barely moved. Shares of British American Tobacco closed down 1.7 percent.  Altria last month announced it would stop selling its pod-based electronic cigarettes, generally smaller devices that use pre-filled nicotine liquid cartridges, in response to the FDA’s concerns about teen usage. The company also said it would restrict flavors for its other e-cigarette products to tobacco, menthol and mint.  Logic, a unit of Japan Tobacco, said in a statement that it is awaiting the FDA’s official announcement but welcomed “steps that ensure the responsible sales of all e-cigarettes and prevent youth access to them.”   A representative for R.J. Reynolds Vapor, a unit of British American Tobacco, declined to comment until getting specifics from the agency, but added the company met with the FDA and supports measures to prevent online sales to minors and penalties for retailers selling to youth.  James Campbell, a spokesman for the Imperial Brands unit that makes blu, said the company supports strong age-verification requirements for online sales but still had questions on how the FDA would differentiate vape stores from other retailers.   A Juul spokeswoman declined to comment. Altria did not respond to a request for comment.  The companies have previously said their products are intended for adult use and that they work to ensure retailers comply with the law.  Juul has previously said the company wants to be “part of the solution in keeping e-cigarettes out of the hands of young people” but that “appropriate flavors play an important role in helping adult smokers switch.”  Meredith Berkman, a founder of Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes, which seeks to curb underage use, said the agency’s move was a “good first step,” but added that “the final step should have happened yesterday.”  “Why not do away with flavors altogether, why not do away with online sales altogether?” she said.       E-cigarettes have been a divisive topic in the public health community. Some focus on the potential for the products to shift lifelong smokers onto less harmful nicotine products, while others fear they risk drawing a new generation into nicotine addiction.  Last year the FDA, under Gottlieb, extended until 2022 a deadline for e-cigarette companies to comply with new federal rules on marketing and public health.

2018-12-31 22:37:00,2018,12.0,31,Hackers Threaten to Dump Insurance Files Related to 9/11 Attacks,"On Monday, New Year’s Eve, a hacker group announced it had breached a law firm handling cases related to the September 11 attacks, and threatened to publicly release a large cache of related internal files unless their ransom demands were met. The news is the latest public extortion attempt from the group known as The Dark Overlord, which has previously targeted a production studio working for Netflix, as well as a host of medical centres and private businesses across the United States. The announcement also signals a slight evolution in The Dark Overlord’s strategy, which has expanded on leveraging the media to exert pressure on victims, to now distributing its threats and stolen data in a wider fashion. In its announcement published on Pastebin, The Dark Overlord points to several different insurers and legal firms, claiming specifically that it hacked Hiscox Syndicates Ltd, Lloyds of London, and Silverstein Properties. “Hiscox Syndicates Ltd and Lloyds of London are some of the biggest insurers on the planet insuring everything from the smallest policies to some of the largest policies on the planet, and who even insured structures such as the World Trade Centers,” the announcement reads. It is unclear what exact files the group has stolen, but it is trying to capitalize on conspiracy theories around the 9/11 attacks. “We'll be providing many answers about 9.11 conspiracies through our 18.000 secret documents leak,” the group tweeted on Monday. A spokesperson for the Hiscox Group confirmed to Motherboard that the hackers had breached a law firm that advised the company, and likely stolen files related to litigation around the 9/11 attacks. “The law firm’s systems are not connected to Hiscox’s IT infrastructure and Hiscox’s own systems were unaffected by this incident. One of the cases the law firm handled for Hiscox and other insurers related to litigation arising from the events of 9/11, and we believe that information relating to this was stolen during that breach,” the spokesperson wrote in an email. “Once Hiscox was informed of the law firm’s data breach, it took action and informed policyholders as required. We will continue to work with law enforcement in both the UK and US on this matter,” they added. Lloyds of London did not respond to a request for comment. The hacking group published a small set of letters, emails and other documents that mention various law firms, as well as the Transport Security Administration (TSA) and Federal Aviation Administration (The TSA could not provide a statement in time for publication, and the FAA told Motherboard in an email it was investigating.) Those documents themselves appear to be fairly innocuous, but the group says it may release more. In its extortion note, The Dark Overlord included a link for a 10GB archive of files it allegedly stole. The group also provided a link to this archive to Motherboard before publishing its announcement. The cache is encrypted, but the hackers are threatening to release the relevant decryption keys, unlocking different sets of files at a time, unless the victims pay the hackers an undisclosed ransom fee in Bitcoin. “Pay the fuck up, or we're going to bury you with this. If you continue to fail us, we'll escalate these releases by releasing the keys, each time a Layer is opened, a new wave of liability will fall upon you,” the extortion note reads. The Dark Overlord is also claiming to be offering to sell the data on a dark web hacking forum, and is attempting to blackmail individuals who may be included in the documents themselves. “If you're one of the dozens of solicitor firms who was involved in the litigation, a politician who was involved in the case, a law enforcement agency who was involved in the investigations, a property management firm, an investment bank, a client of a client, a reference of a reference, a global insurer, or whoever else, you're welcome to contact our e-mail below and make a request to formally have your documents and materials withdrawn from any eventual public release of the materials. However, you'll be paying us,” the group’s post reads. As The Dark Overlord’s announcement notes, the breach itself was previously reported in vague terms by a specialist legal publication, and Hiscox Group pointed Motherboard to the firm’s own April 2018 announcement of a data breach. “Hiscox recently learned of an information security incident affecting a specialist law firm in the US that provided advice to Hiscox or its policyholders on some of its US commercial liability insurance claims. The incident involved illegal access to information stored on the law firm’s server, which may have included information relating to up to 1,500 of Hiscox’s US-based commercial insurance policyholders,” that earlier announcement reads.

2019-06-04 00:00:00,2019,6.0,4,Tesla just finished its best day of the year,"Shares of Tesla have fallen as the company has entered cost-cutting mode and analysts questioned the demand for its vehicles and its future in China. Last week, Tesla's stock dipped below the valuation of CEO Elon Musk's private venture, SpaceX. Investors familiar with SpaceX's latest funding round told CNBC it's valued at $33.3 billion. Tesla may have fallen so far that it is now a good buy, according to Cornerstone Macro technical analyst Carter Worth. Worth said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Fast Money "" that Tesla has ""undershot by such an amount that actually it's so bad, it's good."" Tesla popped early last month after it disclosed plans to raise $2 billion. In a filing, Musk signaled plans to buy around $10 million of the stock in the offering. But shortly after, Musk told employees in a company-wide email obtained by CNBC that the funds would only get the company through 10 months if it failed to cut back its spending. Musk wrote the ""hardcore"" cost-cutting measures would be so granular that he would ""personally review and sign every 10th page"" of outgoing payments. Tesla has made significant progress toward its second-quarter production goals for the Model 3, according to another leaked email from Musk last month. It's also rejiggering its car factory in Fremont, California, CNBC previously reported, allowing it to ramp up production for its Model Y crossover SUV, which is a growing segment. But the company still faces several challenges to its financial health, including the impact of tariffs in China. Loup Ventures co-founder Gene Munster estimated last month that China deliveries would fall from 70,000 to 40,000 vehicles as some Chinese consumers are likely to avoid the brand.

2017-03-09 00:00:00,2017,3.0,9,Google backs UK-based payments company Currencycloud,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s venture arm has invested in Currencycloud, a UK startup that provides technology to enable businesses to provide cross-border payments services to their customers. GV, formerly Google Ventures, participated in a $25 million investment round in Currencycloud alongside existing investors Notion Capital Ltd, Sapphire Ventures LLC, Japanese technology company Rakuten Inc and venture capital firm Anthemis Group, the payments company said on Thursday. The cash injection, which brings the total raised by Currencycloud to $61 million, will be used to support the company’s global expansion plans, the company said. “We just opened up in the U.S. and that requires a lot more development,” said Mike Laven, Currencycloud’s chief executive officer. “We are also seeing tremendous interest from Asia broadly.” Launched in 2012 Currencycloud’s platform allows companies ranging from banks to popular payments startups to offer international payments services without having to set up complex and costly cross-border infrastructure. Clients include Swedish payments business Klarna Inc, lender Standard Bank Group, foreign exchange company Travelex Ltd [TRVLXP.UL] and startups Azimo and Revolut. Around $25 billion has been sent through the company’s infrastructure to more than 200 countries to date. Laven said Google was attracted to Currencycloud because it saw it as a company that provided computer developers tools to add cross-border payment functionality to their services. “Google looked at us as a tool that is used in globalizing domestic businesses,” Laven said. Currencycloud’s funding round comes following a drop in venture capital investments in UK financial technology startups in 2016, as the country’s decision in June to leave the European Union raised concerns on the prospects of local businesses. UK-based fintech companies raised $783 million from venture capitalists last year, down 33.7 percent from 2015, according to a report by trade group Innovate Finance.

2020-01-14 00:00:00,2020,1.0,14,China to frame rules for online-only banks this year in boost to foreigners: sources,"HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China is working to finalize its first rules to cover online-only banking operations in a push to minimize risk in the financial sector and attract players including foreign lenders, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The guidelines could also bolster foreigners with existing China operations such as Citigroup Inc, HSBC Holdings PLC and Standard Chartered PLC by allowing them to set up separate digital banking platforms, two of them said. The framing of rules come as companies’ use of data as well as digital and artificial intelligence technologies have transformed China’s financial services landscape, from processing payments to selling investment products. But foreigners have struggled to make money in mainland retail banking, with many yet to break even despite years of onshore presence as they compete with the vast physical networks of domestic rivals. About a dozen groups including foreigners are in talks with Chinese regulators over the new rules and have shown interest in launching digital banking operations, said one person who has been involved in such discussions with the banking watchdog. The rules would allow them to partner tech firms for independent digital banking platforms, the person said. Banks are expected to be allowed to own majority stakes in online-only banking ventures, the people said, as the government pushes ahead with its strategy of easing access for foreigners to China’s vast financial markets. The framework, which will cover the existing online banking units of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd among others, will form China’s first comprehensive move to standardize oversight of the fast-growing digital banking sector. Other Asian economies including Hong Kong and Singapore are also ushering in digital-only banks. China has licensed four online-only banks since 2014 including Tencent-backed WeBank, Alibaba offshoot MYbank, and AiBank, backed by search engine operator Baidu Inc and China Citic Bank Corp Ltd. The People’s Bank of China and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission did not respond to Reuters’ faxed requests for comment. The people declined to be identified as the regulatory plans are confidential. A spokesman for Citi said the bank would review the rules when they are published, and that its own China consumer banking business had already been digitized. HSBC declined to comment on the rules but said it would welcome any move that continued to open the financial markets in mainland China, and would always look for new opportunities to expand there. StanChart, AiBank, MYbank and WeBank declined to comment. In August, the central bank announced it was developing a three-year plan for the financial technology sector. It has yet to publish plans or give a timetable for doing so. So far the online sector has made little inroad into day-to-day banking, with assets of the four online banks standing at $56 billion at the end of 2018, latest official data showed, accounting for 0.15% of China’s total banking assets.

2019-06-13 00:00:00,2019,6.0,13,"IBM, Walmart, Merck in blockchain collaboration with FDA","(Reuters) - IBM, Merck and Walmart have been chosen for a U.S. Food and Drug Administration pilot program that will explore using blockchain technology to improve the security of prescription drug supply and distribution.  The companies said they would work with consultancy KPMG to create a shared blockchain network that will allow real-time monitoring of products in the pharmaceutical supply chain.  The project has been authorized under the U.S. Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) that was set up to increase regulatory oversight of counterfeit, stolen, contaminated or otherwise harmful drugs.  The FDA has previously used the DSCSA to issue a warning letter to drug distributor McKesson Corp for violations involving opioid medications.   Opioids have been tied to thousands of overdose deaths and state and local governments across the United States have filed lawsuits seeking to hold pharmaceutical companies responsible for the epidemic of abuse.  The new project is aimed at reducing the time needed to track and trace prescription drugs, improving access to reliable distribution information and ensuring products are handled appropriately and stored at the right temperature while being distributed, the companies said in a statement.  Blockchain technology, originally conceived a decade ago as the basis for the cryptocurrency bitcoin, will help stakeholders establish a permanent record and can be integrated with existing systems used to trace products while they are distributed.    The project is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019 and results will be published in a report, the companies said.

2018-10-09 19:34:00,2018,10.0,9,Which Allergy Meds Are the Most Effective? ,"A new study found that just 17 percent of people picked the best OTC medication to treat their allergy symptoms. Really, who can blame them? With all the pills, sprays, and syrups out there, making a decision at the drugstore can be an outright nerve-wracking experience. Here’s how to demystify the allergy aisle so you can find relief sooner. This can be tricky. “Common cold and allergies can have overlapping symptoms like congestion and feeling tired,” says Anju Peters, an allergy and immunology specialist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. But they do have their differences: “A cold will typically last up to two weeks and your symptoms will improve within that time frame,” Peters says. “If you don’t treat allergies, they can last for weeks or even months.” With allergies, you probably won’t have a fever, body aches, or sore throat like you might with a cold, but they do often cause itchy, watery eyes, rashes, and more sneezing, says Jay Portnoy, an allergist in the division of allergy, asthma, and immunology at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City. The time of year might give you some insight—most people experience seasonal allergies in the spring, summer, or fall, but it’s not always a dead giveaway. “Some regions have active allergy seasons all year and indoor allergens like dust mites, mold, and pet dander can bother you in any season, too,” says Andrew Murphy, an allergist and immunologist based in West Chester, PA. “If you’re really unsure, have a doctor check you out—they can give you a more accurate diagnosis.” Antihistamines and decongestants are the two main types of OTC allergy meds, but each one tackles different symptoms. Antihistamines block histamine, a substance released by the body when you come into contact with an allergen, which brings on symptoms like itching, sneezing, and runny nose, Portnoy says. If those are your main issues, Claritin (loratadine), Zyrtec (cetirizine), or Allegra (fexofenadine) are a good bet. Antihistamines are all pretty much the same—it’s not been found that one works better than another—though Zyrtec and “older generation antihistamines” like Benadryl (diphenhydramine) can make you drowsier. Some people can experience the side-effects of one antihistamine more than the other, so if you’re not feeling great, try a different one, Murphy says. But there’s no way to know how you will react, so you can make your first pick based on which one is the most affordable for you, he adds. More from Tonic: If congestion is your main gripe, a decongestant could help. Decongestants decrease the fluid in the lining of your nose by constricting blood vessels, Murphy says. They’re safe to use up to three days; any more than that and you can get rebound congestion, which basically means stuffiness gets worse. “Decongestants also hike up heart rate and blood pressure, and cause nervousness or insomnia, so they’re not for everyone,” Portnoy says. If you just need runny nose relief for a few days—say, you traveled to a new region where pollen counts are way higher than where you live—decongestants are a good option. Steroid nose sprays like Flonase or Rhinocort also target congestion, and if you ask most people who struggles with allergies, they’re often considered the holy grail of OTC products. “Steroid nose sprays work to decrease inflammation in the nasal passages to relieve congestion and runny nose,” Peters says. “But they don’t cause a tolerance like decongestants might, so they’re safe for long- term use and especially helpful for people who get seasonal allergies every year.” If that’s you, Peters recommends using these sprays a few weeks before allergy season kicks in. “Doing so will help prime the nasal passages and make the inflammation from the allergens easier to treat,” she says. If you don’t see improvement within a week of taking a drugstore buy, head to an allergist who can help you come up with a better medication plan and perhaps prescribe something stronger, Portnoy says. “You might also want to make sure you’re not inadvertently inviting allergens to your surroundings,” Peters adds. Small steps like taking a shower before bedtime, running the AC instead of opening windows, and vacuuming regularly can reduce your exposure and help keep symptoms in check.

2016-08-08 00:00:00,2016,8.0,8,"The myth of sex and athletic performance, explained"," (CNN)Ever since the ancient Olympic Games commenced about 776 B.C., tales of athletes secretly engaging in sex at the ceremonies have become common knowledge. As former Olympic swimmer Dara Torres told CNN in 2012, ""What happens in the [Olympic] Village stays in the Village."" Now, with the 2016 Summer Olympics underway in Rio de Janeiro, the idea of athletes ""getting busy"" is back in the spotlight. About 450,000 condoms were allocated this year for athletes to have safe sex. For those who decide to partake in sexual activity, will doing the deed dampen athletic performance on the court, track or field or in the ring? What athletes say about sex The idea dates to ancient Greece and traditional Chinese medicine, which both suggest that abstaining from sex could increase frustration and aggression, and boost energy, said David Bishop, research leader at Victoria University's Institute of Sport, Exercise and Active Living in Melbourne, Australia. Remember the 1976 film ""Rocky""? In the movie, boxer Rocky Balboa's trainer, Mickey, declares that ""women weaken legs,"" suggesting that the athlete should put romance on hold while training and competing.  Along those same lines, Mexico's soccer team announced in 2014 that its players were asked to abstain from sex during the World Cup in Brazil in order to maximize their athletic performance. The team lost in the round of 16, as they had in every World Cup since 1994. On the other hand, MMA fighter Ronda Rousey -- holder of a 12-1 UFC record -- told Showtime's Jim Rome in 2012 that she tries to have ""as much sex as possible"" before a fight since it has been linked to higher testosterone levels in women. Nonetheless, very few studies have scientifically examined how sex can improve or impair athletic performance -- if at all, Bishop said. He added that he is only aware of four, and ""all of the studies have been on males."" A lack of research The research that Bishop cited includes a small study published in the Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness in 2000, which involved 15 high-level athletes between the ages of 20 and 40 who participated in a two-day experiment. The athletes were instructed to abstain from sex for at least 24 hours before the beginning of the study. On the first day, they completed a stress test on an exercise bike in the morning, a mental test designed to measure concentration in the afternoon and then a second stress test on an exercise bike later in the afternoon.  In between the mental test and the second stress test, about 4:15 p.m., blood samples were taken for testosterone measurements.  Next, the athletes had sexual relations with their usual partners, who were aware of the protocol of the research. The following day, the athletes participated in the same tests and had their testosterone levels measured again. The researchers found that sexual activity had no significant overall effect on how the athletes performed during the exercise and mental tests. However, during the morning exercise test after sex, the researchers noticed slightly higher heart-rate levels.  They concluded that ""the recovery capacity of an athlete could be affected if he had sexual intercourse approximately 2 hours before a competition event."" A separate paper, published last month in the journal Frontiers in Physiology, found that sex had no significant effect on athletic performance. The paper involved a systematic review of nine studies on the topic of sexual activity and athleticism. Those researchers concluded that ""The present review demonstrates that sex activity in sport is poorly investigated in both males and females. However, the data available do not really support the misconception that sex activity can produce a negative effect on the athlete's performance."" Sex advice for athletes All in all, athletes attending the Olympic Games in Rio this month should not worry excessively about how sex may affect their competitions, said Emmanuele Jannini, professor of endocrinology and medical sexology at the University of Rome-Tor Vergata in Italy. ""Sex is not just fun but also healthy,"" he said, ""however, if concentration is important, I would suggest to avoid sex for some few days before the game."" Bishop, the sports scientist in Australia, advised against having sex only if it was going to affect sleep.  ""If sex is going to affect performance, it will be via a lack of sleep. ... Wait until after your final event,"" he said, adding, ""but I can't see any problems with having sex and then getting a good night's sleep."" However, the current consensus among coaches and trainers seems to be that each athlete should make the individual choice of whether to have sex in the midst of a major competition. ""Current thinking in elite sports is that athletes should act in ways they consider 'normal' and not do something that goes against their beliefs, which will induce guilt, such as believing pre-competition sex is not good for you and yet engage in sex anyway,"" said Mark Anshel, professor emeritus at Middle Tennessee State University's Department of Health and Human Performance.  ""A lot of athletes feel guilt-free and OK about pre-competition sex because it helps them sleep better as long as their sleep is not disrupted and sex does not follow a night of partying and alcohol intake,"" he said. ""Most contemporary coaches seem to agree."" ",https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/08/health/sex-olympics-athletic-performance/index.html,health,CNN,health,886

2019-04-24 00:00:00,2019,4.0,24,SAP welcomes Elliott's $1.3 billion investment; shares hit high,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. activist investor Elliott revealed a 1.2 billion euro ($1.3 billion) stake in SAP on Wednesday and said it supported a new management efficiency drive, sending shares in the German business software company to a record high. SAP has until now escaped the attention of activist investors, steered by co-founder and Chairman Hasso Plattner who has withstood tough competition from U.S. rivals and is still the biggest shareholder in the German company with 6.5 percent. Yet SAP has never achieved the 40 percent profit margins that Microsoft boasted at its height. It reported an adjusted operating margin of 24 percent for the first quarter as it grapples with a catch-up transition to cloud computing. Europe’s most valuable technology company now wants to expand adjusted operating margins by a total of 5 percentage points through 2023. “This is that magic moment that people have been waiting for where they are like, wow, nobody grows like SAP, but can I get some margin out of this growth?” Bill McDermott, the 57-year-old New Yorker who has run SAP for nine years, told Reuters. “I think our shareholders are going to be super-psyched.” Boosting margins in the cloud - where SAP’s subscription-based products are hosted remotely - is the holy grail for a company that still makes most of its money from license fees and maintenance for software running on customers’ on-site servers. The Elliott stake of around 1 percent in SAP is the first German technology investment by the $34 billion U.S. hedge fund group, which has also urged industrial conglomerate Thyssenkrupp to restructure and called on utility Uniper to agree to a takeover by Fortum. Elliott technology-team partner Jesse Cohn and portfolio manager Jason Genrich have a track record of close involvement with the firms they back, with Cohn for example taking a board seat at online marketplace eBay as part of a deal with management on a strategy review and running activist campaigns at software firms EMC and Citrix. “Elliott fully supports the initiatives announced today,” Cohn and Genrich said in a statement. “The company’s shares were clearly undervalued in relation to its revenue growth, and today’s announcement lays the foundation for substantial realization of value.” SAP’s shares have underperformed rivals Oracle, Salesforce and Microsoft in the past 12 months. It trades at a forward price/earnings ratio of 21, compared to 58 at Salesforce, an all-cloud outfit, 25 at Microsoft and 15 at Oracle, according to Refinitiv data. (GRAPHIC: SAP vs The Rest - tmsnrt.rs/2Od1Dck) “SAP is in the fortunate position that a number of shareholders give us regular feedback – we welcome that feedback, which we take seriously, especially as we advance our plans to meet or beat our 2023 ambitions,” SAP said in response to the Elliott investment. Max Anderl, a fund manager at top 30 shareholder UBS Asset Management, said: “SAP is one of our biggest positions and relative to European peers attractively valued. We appreciate the exploration of new angles to create shareholder value.” The pivot by McDermott came as SAP reported a quarterly operating loss of 136 million euros due to an 886 million euro up-front charge arising from the announcement in January that SAP would let go of 4,400 people. After adjusting for that and other one-offs, non-IFRS operating profits rose by 13 percent at constant currencies to 1.47 billion euros, above expectations in a poll of 17 analysts. Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic said the staffing exercise, only the second major restructuring since SAP was founded by Plattner and a group of former IBM colleagues in 1972, was on track. SAP lifted its growth forecast for non-IFRS operating profits this year to 9.5-12.5 percent at constant currencies, while also nudging up its outlook for 2020. Its shares rose 11.3 percent - their biggest daily gain since Nov. 2008. That in turn lifted the Stoxx Europe 600 Technology Index by 3.6 percent to its highest since last June. SAP will update investors at a capital markets day on Nov. 12 in New York. It is eyeing a multi-year share buyback program as McDermott sets his sights on more than doubling the company’s market capitalization to $300 billion. Valuing the cloud side of the business at 10 times revenues - in line with industry peers - gives a figure of $200 billion based on projected 2023 revenues, McDermott said. Add to that a core revenue multiple of 4-5 times gives another $100 billion. “It’s just simple math,” he told Reuters.

2019-03-25 11:49:00,2019,3.0,25,"'Dwarf Fortress' Is Abandoning Its Text-Based Graphics, but Not Its Soul","  Dwarf Fortress is a hard game to classify. It’s part simulation, part RPG, and part rogue-like. It generates a 2D world and tasks the player with managing a fortress and helping its dwarves survive. There are goblins, gods, mysteries, quests, geese, drinking, cats, and more, and all these elements can interact in unpredictable ways. After one update, players began to notice cats padding around drunk and vomiting. The update had added taverns for the dwarves, which led to spilled beer, which cats walked through. Later, when the cats clean themselves, they imbibed the alcohol and got drunk. That’s how deep the simulation gets.  But players had to imagine the cat vomit because  Dwarf Fortress is rendered entirely in ASCII—a vast fantasy world created with less graphical fidelity than you'll find in a Word Document. There’s nothing that looks or plays quite like it. Now, that's changing.   For 15 years, Bay 12 Games gave away  Dwarf Fortressthe game for free and supported development through donations and a Patreon. On March 13, Bay 12 Games announced it would begin selling  Dwarf Fortress through Steam and Itch.io. Selling the game isn’t the only radical change—the Steam version of  Dwarf Fortress would abandon its iconic ASCII art style in favor of a 2D tileset.  The unique ASCII art style defined the game for the better part of two decades. Moving away from the iconic look will change the game but it might change it for the better. Developer Tarn Adams, (who founded Bay 12 games with his brother Zach) wants to give  Dwarf Fortress to a whole new group of people. The Adams brothers teamed up with developer Kitfox Games (the studio behind  Shrouded Isle) and its own modding community to update  Dwarf Fortress’ art style without abandoning its soul.   In fact, Adams thinks that the 2D change presents unique opportunities to make the game more accessible and fix legacy issues with  Dwarf Fortress.   “ASCII is not purely an aesthetic choice. It is restrictive,” Adams told me over the phone.  According to Adams, the decision to use ASCII in the first place was pure happenstance.“[ Dwarf Fortress] started as an ASCII game called  Mutant Miner...it was supposed to be this little throwaway game.”   But  Mutant Miner kept evolving. Bay 12 Games kept adding elements, tweaking it, and eventually realized its simple turn-based game about mining had turned into a procedurally generated real-time strategy simulation. They kept the ASCII style because working with it was fast. They effectively didn’t have to worry about art.  “We released in ASCII and kept working in ASCII for that reason—the development was so fast and we were not qualified to draw,” Adams said.  As Bay 12 Games continued to develop  Dwarf Fortress, it ran up against the limitations of that choice. There’s only 128 ASCII characters to choose from, which is why a goose, a goblin, and a gremlin all use the same letter—a lowercase g. “Even with color, I’ve run into overlaps now,” Adams said. He pointed out a six pointed star which  Dwarf Fortress uses for a turtle, a campfire, and a gem. Adams said he thinks Bay 12 Games has used the six sided star for 15 different objects.  Adams is conscious that, while ASCII has its limitations, there’s something iconic about the art style. He knows that leaving ASCII behind will change the game, but he still wants to preserve its soul.   “In some sense, it’s not possible,” Adams said. “It really is a distinct look. At the same time, the people that we’ve brought on to make the tileset have both been with the community for ten years each. They’re modders. They dig it. They really understand the game.”  Bay 12 Games partnered with developer Kitfox Games. Kitfox Games' Creative Director Tanya Short brought on  Dwarf Fortress modders Mike “Mayday” Madej and Patrick ""Meph"" Martin Schroeder to build the tileset for the Steam release. “I’m really happy with the dwarf that Mayday Mike drew,” Adams said. “It has a harrowed look to it, it’s not a happy little Snow White dwarf. These poor dwarves. They don’t know what to expect. I’m super happy with how this is going.”  But the 2D facelift isn’t just about changing the art style, it’s about opening the game up to more people, making it accessible, and fixing legacy issues.   “All of the accessibility questions for  Dwarf Fortress are on the table,” Adams said. “We’re going to look at the interface and the menu structure and common problems that new players have that make them bounce off the game.”  One of the big issues Adams is hoping to tackle is topography.  Dwarf Fortress allows players to build a fortress with multiple levels and that’s hard to navigate in ASCII. In its current form, players move between layers of the game individually and have to keep track of the whole fortress in their mind. It’s like leafing through pages of a book. With some clever shading techniques, it’s easier to create a multi-leveled fortress in a 2D space.   “Before, when I had 16 colors, I couldn't do that,” Adams said. “If the lower level is a darker green, well, there's only one darker green available, and it might clash with some of the darker green stuff that's above. And then you can't tell what's up and what's down. It's just confusing.”  Adams also pointed out that the ASCII art style alienated a number of different potential players. People with color blindness and dyslexia had a hard time picking up the game.  Dwarf Fortress uses color to distinguish between creatures—a goblin and a goose are both the letter “g” but the colors are slightly different variants of white. If you can’t see color, you can’t tell the difference.  Adams is excited for the future of  Dwarf Fortress, but he knows some people will always love the ASCII original. “There's a crew of ASCII people who really liked the fact that like, a dragon is a capital D, because then they can imagine the dragon, that's been in their mind their whole life,” he said. “Now we'll have a great looking dragon, but it’ll have more properties that are assigned to it by the artist rather than the player. That’s the trade off.” But Bay 12 Games isn’t abandoning the ASCII version of  Dwarf Fortress. It plans to keep updating the game with more unicode pages (an enhanced superset of ASCII) and design tweaks and every copy sold on Steam and Itch.io will come with the ASCII version. “Everyone everywhere can experience  [Dwarf Fortress] the the way they want to experience it.”",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pan94n/dwarf-fortress-is-abandoning-its-text-based-graphics-but-not-its-soul,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,1100

Speaking to CBS This Morning, Burns said that they are working with the Centers for Disease Control as the government agency begins investigating the nearly 200 reported cases of breathing problems linked to vaping. He said the reports are “worrisome for the category; worrisome for us, if we contributed to it,” but that he needs more information before making any changes to the Juul products. “CDC is leading the investigations; we’re obviously in close contact with them. They’re in charge of the investigation, we like to get all the specifics that we can,” he said. “We want to make sure that we have access to all the information so if there’s any issue that was associated with us, we want to get to the root cause to understand that.”  Asked why Juul would not pause selling their e-cigarettes, Burns said he does not yet know if they are at fault for the lung illnesses, and he believes the issues are mostly due to vape pens with THC, a compound in marijuana. “I don’t know if it’s tied to vaping or even associated with nicotine products — most of the early reports have indicated it’s related to THC, so,” he said. CBS This Morning co-host Tony Dokoupil interjected to say that “most” may not be an accurate descriptor, and Burns said that they need more information in all cases. “Most of [the reports] that have any specifics have said they’re related to THC — we don’t have the details related to all those reports,” Burns said. “If there was any indication that there was an adverse health problem related to our product, I think we’d take very swift actions associated with it.” Burns affirmed to Dokoupil that he feels “confident” in confident in continuing to sell Juul’s products during the investigations. “At this point, until we see some facts — and the CDC is leading the investigation — yes we do,” he said. An Illinois resident who had recently vaped died of a severe respiratory illness in the last week, according to the state’s Department of Public Health. The resident was one of over 20 cases of vaping-related illnesses under investigation in Illinois, and the CDC announced Friday that they are looking into 193 cases across 16 states that occurred in the last two months.",https://people.com/health/juul-ceo-lung-illnesses-tied-to-vaping-worrisome/,health,People,health,431

In fact, HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. It’s so common that nearly everyone will get at least one type of the virus in their lifetime, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and about 80 million Americans are currently infected. It’s as common as men not knowing how to sext or Sky Ferreira lying about her album coming out Otis is right, though, about HPV being nothing to “freak the F out” over; the CDC says that nine out of 10 infections clear up on their own within two years. Even though coverage of Otis’ HPV journey has referred to the infection as “common,” these facts are important context—HPV stigma is still totally a real thing. Some strains do carry a cancer risk, however, causing nearly 35,000 new cases of cancer every year, so it’s still important to seek treatment from a medical professional, even if HPV isn’t a big deal, generally speaking. Unfortunately, Otis indicates in the Instagram post she will have to wait until after her pregnancy is over to investigate whether her HPV is more serious—which, still, would be nothing to be ashamed of, of course. The important thing is to get checked out, treated if necessary, and monitored by a licensed professional. Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.

2016-02-16 00:00:00,2016,2.0,16,Scientists hail spectacular results from cancer ‘revolution’,"Terminally ill blood cancer patients have experienced complete remission following the introduction of a radical new treatment, scientists claim. Speaking at the annual meeting for the American Association for the Advancement for Science (AAAS), researcher Stanley Riddell said Monday the results were unprecedented. ""In the laboratory and in clinical trials, we are seeing dramatic responses in patients with tumors. ""Unlike a chemotherapy drug which destroys cancer cells that are growing, you put in a living therapy that engages the cancer in hand to hand combat"". The new cancer therapy from Riddell's team uses the body's own immune cells to attack tumors. ""When you see it work, it is so amazing-the bone marrow just goes from being full of leukemia to being in remission, and very large tumors simply melt away,"" Riddell said on his company website. The technique involves taking T-cells from patients, arming them with molecules that target cancer, and putting them back into the body. The new T-cells then seek and destroy cancer. According to data presented at the AAAS meeting, and reported by several news outlets, one trial witnessed 94 percent of patients with a form of leukaemia see symptoms vanish. And patients with other blood cancers saw response rates of more than 80 percent, with half experiencing total remission. Dr Chiara Bonini, of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute in Milan, Italy called the results revolutionary. ""The last time [I saw] a change in remission rates like this must have been in 2000."" ""T-cells are a living drug, and in particular they have the potential to persist in our body for our whole lives,"" she said at the joint presentation. And she believes a product coming to market is not long off. ""I think we are at the beginning of a road. I think the first products will be available very soon,"" Dr Bonini said. Detailed findings of the clinical trials are to be published later this year.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/16/scientists-hail-spectacular-results-from-cancer-revolution.html,Health and Science,CNBC,health,321
2017-10-18 00:00:00,2017,10.0,18,Toronto's internet city features taxibots and self-driving shuttles,"Google’s founders have long fantasized about what would happen if the company could shape the real world as much as it has life on the internet. “Years ago, we were sitting there thinking, Wouldn’t it be nice if you could take technical things that we know and apply them to cities?” Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Alphabet (now Google’s parent company), said Tuesday. “And our founders got really excited about this. We started talking about all of these things that we could do if someone would just give us a city and put us in charge.” That is, of course, an outlandish idea. “For all sorts of good reasons, by the way, it doesn’t work that way,” Mr. Schmidt acknowledged. But there he was standing Tuesday before an array of Canadian flags, in front of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ontario officials, to announce the closest thing anyone has seen to a tech company that takes the reins in a major city. Toronto has about 800 acres of waterfront property awaiting redevelopment, a huge and prime stretch of land that amounts to one of the best opportunities in North America to rethink at scale how housing, streets and infrastructure are built. On Tuesday the government and the group overseeing the land announced that they were partnering with an Alphabet subsidiary, Sidewalk Labs, to develop the site. They want it to embody the city of the future, a technological test bed for other communities around the world, “the world’s first neighborhood built from the internet up.” The Sidewalk Labs proposal in the competitive bid for the project floated all kinds of technological dreams: a thermal energy grid that would be carbon neutral, sensors that separate waste from recycling, modular buildings that convert from retail to housing, monitors that track noise and pollution, self-driving transit shuttles, shared-ride taxibots, adaptive traffic lights, delivery robots, heated bike paths and sidewalks that melt snow on their own. In theory, each of these ideas would be best tested across more than just one building or street, and all of them would be more easily implemented together. Once you cover your traffic lights in sensors, it’s easier to turn them into air-quality monitors, too; as long as you’re redesigning streets around driverless cars, you can also think about what the delivery robots need. The prospect of a city designed by technologists, at least as a thought experiment until now, has made some nervous, urbanists especially. The tech industry is better known in its Silicon Valley backyard for contributing to rather than solving urban problems like unaffordable housing and traffic. And its corporate campuses are mostly models of how not to build cities, with mega office parks (and spaceship designs) dependent on cars and detached from their neighboring communities. There’s no small contradiction in having tech founders muse about how to build better cities from places that bear little resemblance to lively cities at all. The tech industry also thrives by working in ways that can be incompatible with public-sector city-building. It’s hard to “move fast and break things” in government, and public funds don’t allow for the failure rates that venture capital does. New tech products are often targeted to early adopters, and they spread to the rest of us later. But you can’t do that with innovations in public service; if the tech savvy get the nicer bus routes or the new Wi-Fi kiosks first, that raises equity issues for the rest of the city. There’s also the hitch that cities are inherently organic and unpredictable. They resist omniscient engineering. And past efforts at doing that — whether through the urban renewal of individual neighborhoods or the wholesale development of utopias — have invariably failed for that reason. How the Frightful Five Put Start-Ups in a Lose-Lose SituationHow Many People Watch Netflix? Nielsen Tries to Solve a MysteryAfter Drone Hits Plane in Canada, New Fears About Air Safety Many intractable urban problems are in fact not engineering problems at all, including the ones that most look like it. Housing is very expensive in a place like San Francisco not because we haven’t developed the right engineering methods to build it more cheaply. Unaffordable housing is largely a political problem — we haven’t developed the societal consensus to build enough of it. Sidewalk Labs, to its credit, has internalized many of these criticisms. The company, formed by Google two years ago, has pointedly been based in New York City and not Silicon Valley. It’s staffed by both technologists and government alums. Its leader, the former New York City deputy mayor Dan Doctoroff, openly acknowledges the gulf between technologists and city government types. And Sidewalk Labs says it wants to bridge the two. “We all collectively see cities as about friction: good friction and bad friction,” Mr. Doctoroff told me not long after Sidewalk Labs started. “Good friction is serendipity, it’s opportunity, it’s diversity, it’s seeing 40 different nationalities on the subway as you commute in the morning. Bad friction is congestion, it’s pollution.” The technologist’s temptation may be to try to build a city from scratch, with none of that friction. And especially without the greatest friction of all, politics. In Toronto, Sidewalk Labs is looking at something between a blank slate and New York City: a sizable plot of land to develop that’s still part of a city large enough that any successful ideas could ultimately spread. Because it’s looking at a neighborhood and not just a typical developer’s parcel, Sidewalk Labs can play with all the infrastructure that connects those parcels — the utility grid, the street network, the sidewalks. But there would be no point in doing all that if there weren’t thousands of people nearby ready to move in, as is the case in rapidly growing Toronto. (Google also announced Tuesday that it would move its Canadian headquarters, which are in Toronto, into the first pilot phase of the development.) The challenge now amid all the carbon-neutral, internet-enabled robot-monitor sensors will be to keep those humans in mind.

2019-01-28 11:00:04,2019,1.0,28,Study Offers Hint of Hope for Staving Off Dementia in Some People,"People who received intensive treatment for hypertension were less likely to develop minor cognitive problems than those receiving standard treatment. In dementia research, so many paths have led nowhere that any glimmer of optimism is noteworthy. So some experts are heralding the results of a large new study, which found that people with hypertension who received intensive treatment to lower their blood pressure were less likely than those receiving standard blood pressure treatment to develop minor memory and thinking problems that often progress to dementia. The study, published Monday in JAMA, is the first large, randomized clinical trial to find something that can help many older people reduce their risk of mild cognitive impairment — an early stage of faltering function and memory that is a frequent precursor to Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. The results apply only to those age 50 or older who have elevated blood pressure and who do not have diabetes or a history of stroke. But that’s a condition affecting a lot of people — more than 75 percent of people over 65 have hypertension, the study said. So millions might eventually benefit by reducing not only their risk of heart problems but of cognitive decline, too. “It’s kind of remarkable that they found something,” said Dr. Kristine Yaffe, a professor of psychiatry and neurology at University of California San Francisco, who was not involved in the research. “I think it actually is very exciting because it tells us that by improving vascular health in a comprehensive way, we could actually have an effect on brain health.” The research was part of a large cardiovascular study called Sprint, begun in 2010 and involving more than 9,000 racially and ethnically diverse people at 102 sites in the United States. The participants had hypertension, defined as a systolic blood pressure (the top number) from 130 to 180, without diabetes or a history of stroke. These were people who could care for themselves, were able to walk and get themselves to doctors’ appointments, said the principal investigator, Dr. Jeff D. Williamson, chief of geriatric medicine and gerontology at Wake Forest School of Medicine. The primary goal of the Sprint study was to see if people treated intensively enough that their blood pressure dropped below 120 would do better than people receiving standard treatment which brought their blood pressure just under 140. They did — so much so that in 2015, the trial was stopped because the intensively treated participants had significantly lower risk of cardiovascular events and death that it would have been unethical not to inform the standard group of the benefit of further lowering their blood pressure. But the cognitive arm of the study, called Sprint Mind, continued to follow the participants for three more years even though they were no longer monitored for whether they continued with intensive blood pressure treatment. About 8,500 participants received at least one cognitive assessment. The primary outcome researchers measured was whether patients developed “probable dementia.” Fewer patients did so in the group whose blood pressure was lowered to 120. But the difference — 149 people in the intensive-treatment group versus 176 people in the standard-treatment group — was not enough to be statistically significant. But in the secondary outcome — developing mild cognitive impairment or MCI — results did show a statistically significant difference. In the intensive group, 287 people developed it, compared to 353 people in the standard group, giving the intensive treatment group a 19 percent lower risk of mild cognitive impairment, Dr. Williamson said. Because dementia often develops over many years, Dr. Williamson said he believes that following the patients for longer would yield enough cases to definitively show whether intensive blood pressure treatment helps prevent dementia too. To find out, the Alzheimer’s Association said Monday it would fund two more years of the study. “Sprint Mind 2.0 and the work leading up to it offers genuine, concrete hope,” Maria C. Carrillo, the association’s chief science officer, said in a statement. “MCI is a known risk factor for dementia, and everyone who experiences dementia passes through MCI. When you prevent new cases of MCI, you are preventing new cases of dementia.” Dr. Yaffe said the study had several limitations and left many questions unanswered. It’s unclear how it applies to people with diabetes or other conditions that often accompany high blood pressure. And she said she would like to see data on the participants older than 80, since some studies have suggested that in people that age, hypertension might protect against dementia. The researchers did not specify which type of medication people took, although Dr. Williamson said they plan to analyze by type to see if any of the drugs produced a stronger cognitive benefit. Side effects of the intensive treatment stopped being monitored after the main trial ended, but Dr. Williamson said the biggest negative effect was dehydration. Dr. Williamson said the trial has changed how he treats patients, offering those with blood pressure over 130 the intensive treatment. “I’ll tell them it will give you a 19 percent lower chance of developing early memory loss,” he said. Dr. Yaffe is more cautious about changing her approach. “I don’t think we’re ready to roll it out,” she said. “It’s not like I’m going to see a patient and say ‘Oh my gosh your blood pressure is 140; we need to go to 120.’ We really need to understand much more about how this might differ by your age, by the side effects, by maybe what else you have.” Still, she said, “I do think the take-home message is that blood pressure and other measures of vascular health have a role in cognitive health,” she said. “And nothing else has worked.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/health/dementia-blood-pressure-cognitive-impairment.html,health,The New York Times,health,955

Spotify, which launched a year after the 2007 launch of the iPhone, said on Wednesday that Apple's control of its App store deprived consumers of choice and rival providers of audio streaming services to the benefit of Apple Music, which began in 2015. Central to Spotify's complaint, filed to the European Commission on Monday, is what it says is a 30 percent fee Apple charges content-based service providers to use Apple's in-app purchase system (IAP). Horacio Gutierrez, Spotify's general counsel, said the company was pressured into using the billing system in 2014, but then was forced to raise the monthly fee of its premium service from 9.99 to 12.99 euros, just as Apple Music launched at Spotify's initial 9.99 price. Spotify then ceased use of Apple's IAP system, meaning Spotify customers could only upgrade to the fee-based package indirectly, such as on a laptop. Under App store rules, Spotify said, content-based apps could not include buttons or external links to pages with production information, discounts or promotions and faced difficulties fixing bugs. Such restrictions do not apply to Android phones, it said. ""Promotions are essential to our business. This is how we convert our free customers to premium,"" Gutierrez said. Voice recognition system Siri would not hook iPhone users up to Spotify and Apple declined to let Spotify launch an app on its Apple Watch, Spotify said.

2019-10-22 13:39:19,2019,10.0,22,How Children Get Hooked on Sugary Drinks,"Misleading marketing and labeling may confuse parents about the health value of many juices, a new report finds. Slave to your sweet tooth? Researchers say the predilection for sweetened drinks — a major driver of the nation’s obesity crisis — begins in childhood. That’s one reason health experts recommend children under 2 never be given fruit juice. When it comes to children 2 to 18, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a daily limit of 25 grams of sugar, or six teaspoons. Nice try. Last year, nearly two-thirds of the $2.2 billion in beverages marketed to children contained added sweeteners, according to a report released last week by the Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity at the University of Connecticut. At a time of mounting childhood obesity, food and beverage giants like Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz and Harvest Hill spent nearly $21 million last year advertising sugary drinks to children. Although beverage companies have been developing healthier options like blends of juice and water, the report found that the packaging and marketing of these products often leaves parents confused. Another problem, the center found, is that drinks made with 100 percent fruit juice and those devoid of wholesome ingredients are often sold side by side in supermarket aisles. Some of the confusion is intentional. Labels on drinks that contain no fruit juice are frequently splashed with images of apples, oranges and grapes, and many tout prodigious amounts of vitamin C. Others shout “no added sugar” on the front but bury any mention of artificial sweeteners in fine print on the back. “I think parents are terribly confused,” said Jennifer L. Harris, the lead author of the report. “I’ve talked to parents with Ph.D.’s in public health who say they’ve been tricked into buying unhealthy drinks for their kids.” Sugary drinks are responsible for almost half the added sugar consumed by American children, but many pediatricians remain wary of artificial sweeteners because they help cultivate a child’s sugar cravings, and they are most often added to products with little nutritional value. “If your children gets used to sweetness, it’s going to be almost impossible to get them to drink milk or plain water,” Dr. Harris said. The Rudd Center analyzed 23 of the best-selling children’s drinks and ranked those with the highest sugar content and those most heavily advertised to children. The center also flagged products most likely to subtly misrepresent their front-of-label ingredients. Here are a few that stood out. Just a single serving exceeds the recommended daily limit of sugar for children by three grams, but it gets worse: the 16-ounce bottles technically contain two servings, which means an especially thirsty child could gulp down 56 grams of sugar in one go. Adding to the impression of wholesomeness are the profusion of bright red cranberries on the front label, the words “No High Fructose Corn Syrup!” and the tagline “100 percent Vitamin C.” [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] What it lacks in real fruit juice (it has none), this iconic childhood thirst-quencher makes up in sugar. A lot. A multi-serving bottle contains 38 grams of sugar per 12-ounce serving. This Kool-Aid flavor and others also dominate the list of products that use “child features” — marketing devices like cartoons, wacky names and words like “cool,” “fun” and “extreme” to appeal to children. Kool-Aid Sour Jammers topped the list, with an average of five such features per package. Those who experienced their first sugar high on this birthday party staple won’t be surprised that Hawaiian Punch comes in third among the most sugar-laden children’s drinks. On the plus side, Fruit Juicy Red contains 5 percent fruit juice and no caffeine and it’s gluten free. Hawaiian Punch’s popularity helped its owner, Keurig Dr Pepper, rack up $7.4 billion in sales last year, an 11 percent increase over the year before. With its gargantuan lemons and claims of 100 percent fruit juice, a box of Minute Maid Lemonade can give consumers the impression that it is a healthy drink option. It contains 11 percent fruit juice, and the second ingredient, after water, is high-fructose corn syrup, followed by sugar. Because supermarket refrigerators often display the lemonade side by side with 100 percent juice products, some consumers consider it as salubrious as orange juice. Also confusing: an official serving of Minute Maid Lemonade is just 6 ounces, less than a cup. Flavored waters are one of the fastest growing categories in the drinks industry, fueled in part by the perception that they are healthy. But many of these products are sweetened with hard-to-pronounce additives like acesulfame potassium. You wouldn’t glean that from the packaging of Capri Sun Roarin’ Waters, which touts “50 percent less sugar” and “all natural ingredients” but makes no mention of the Stevia that makes the drink so sweet. These products also have another distinction: they are far more likely to be advertised to black children than to white children. The Rudd Center found that the average black child 6 to 11 was likely to view Capri Sun television ads 21 times over the course of 2018, compared to 11 times for white children.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/health/drinks-sugar-children.html,health,The New York Times,health,864
2016-02-04 20:24:04,2016,2.0,4,Unicef Report Finds Female Genital Cutting to Be Common in Indonesia,"Female genital cutting has always been seen as an ancient ritual practiced in Africa and to a lesser extent in the Middle East, but a new global assessment documents for the first time that it is widespread in one of the most populous countries in Asia: Indonesia, where almost half the women are estimated to have undergone it. There has long been anecdotal evidence of the practice there, but the United Nations Children’s Fund estimated Thursday that 60 million women and girls there have been cut based on national survey data collected by the Indonesian government. The addition of Indonesia is largely responsible for raising the global tally of women and girls who have undergone the practice to 200 million from 130 million, and the number of countries where it is concentrated to 30 from 29. “We knew the practice existed but we didn’t have a sense of the scope,” said Claudia Cappa, a statistics specialist for Unicef, which released the report. She said the new data from Indonesia showed that cutting was not just “an African problem.” Experts in Indonesia said the practice there had largely involved a less drastic version of cutting, usually a surface scratch or nick, as compared with more severe disfiguring. The Indonesian government’s survey asked parents if their young daughters had undergone circumcision. Ms. Cappa said it was possible that there were some more severe cases in Indonesia, but she said the official Indonesian government definition of female circumcision was “an act of scratching the skin that covers the front of clitoris without injuring the clitoris.” The Indonesian data is part of Unicef’s latest global update on female genital cutting, which shows that over all the practice is declining worldwide. For example, the percentage of girls ages 15 to 19 who have been cut has declined from 51 percent in 1985 to 37 percent today in the countries where the practice is concentrated. Some countries have shown rapid and significant declines. In Egypt, where 97 percent of 15- to 19-year-olds were circumcised 30 years ago, the rate is now 70 percent. Burkina Faso has dropped from 89 percent to 58 percent, and Liberia from 72 percent to 31 percent. Still, even as the United Nations advocates an end to cutting — and Unicef surveys report that men, women, boys and girls in many of the countries agree it should be eliminated — the practice persists. The Unicef report says that “current progress is insufficient to keep up with increasing population growth” and if trends continue the number of girls and women being cut “will rise significantly over the next 15 years.” The data from Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation, provides a snapshot of the prevalence of genital cutting in a country where secular and religious attitudes toward the practice are increasingly in conflict. Indonesian authorities tried to ban cutting 10 years ago, but religious authorities who consider it important for girls to undergo the ritual before marriage objected. In response, the government softened its stance, issuing regulations that directed cutting should be done only by medical professionals in a noninvasive way that does not injure girls and women. The Indonesian survey reported that 49 percent of girls age 11 and younger had undergone female circumcision, mostly as infants, and more than half of the procedures were performed by midwives or other health professionals. The practice is “regarded as part of our culture, or a confirmation that they will be officially ‘Islamized,’ ” Jurnalis Uddin, the chairman of the Center for Population and Gender Studies at Yarsi University in Jakarta, said in an email, adding that the practice “in Indonesia is mostly symbolic (no cutting at all).” For Unicef and others who seek to eliminate the practice in all its forms, the fact that medical providers are performing the procedures is unwelcome because it can confer legitimacy on the practice. “We are very concerned with medicalization,” said Francesca Moneti, a child protection specialist with Unicef. “Medical personnel are looked up to and are seen as knowing what’s good for your girl.” The Indonesian survey, conducted in 2013 as part of large general health questionnaire administered to 300,000 households, was the first time the government collected national data on the practice. Although the data applied only to girls age 11 and younger, Unicef officials extrapolated it to the entire female population given the practice’s deep roots there, Ms. Cappa said. Because Indonesia has such a large population, Unicef estimated that about 60 million women and girls in Indonesia have been cut. The survey found that the practice was reported in most provinces, but was more prevalent among urban and wealthier families. Views of the practice among Indonesian women vary. Rena Herdiyani, vice chairwoman of Kalyanamitra, an Indonesian nongovernmental organization that lobbies the national government to ban all forms of cutting, wants the government to impose sanctions on people who perform circumcisions. “They think it’s a family or cultural tradition, and an Islamic obligation, yet they can’t name any verses in the Quran about female circumcision,” she said. But there are strong supporters like Lia Sarifah, 47, whose experience involved more than just a scratch and occurred when she was 7 because her parents wanted her to be old enough to remember it. She recalls shaking with fear as she lay down on a bed at her parents’ house on the island of Sulawesi, and said a traditional healer pushed up the hem of her new dress, holding a small traditional knife in his gloved hands. A few minutes later he stood up with a small sliver of her clitoris. But Ms. Lia said she recalled that day not with anger or shame, but with pride. “Even today, I believe in circumcision and support it,” she said, sitting on the floor of her Jakarta salon, where she also makes and sells ceremonial dresses for young girls’ circumcisions. “If we don’t, then we can’t be whole as women and we can’t marry.” Conflicting views have influenced public policy toward cutting. In 2006, the Ministry of Health issued a document banning female circumcision by medical professionals. In response, in 2008, Indonesia’s top Muslim clerical body issued a nonbinding fatwa or edict saying female circumcision should be performed if requested, as long as the method was not physically or psychologically dangerous. In 2010, the Ministry of Health, at the urging of the clerical body, issued a regulation saying female circumcision should be performed only by licensed doctors, midwives or nurses using safety and cleanliness procedures detailed by the ministry. But anti-cutting activists objected to the regulation, and in 2014 it was repealed. Unicef officials assert in their report that the repeal does not go far enough because it does not explicitly prohibit cutting or set penalties for those who perform the procedure. In Jakarta, Fitri Yanti, a pregnant 30-year-old mother of two, said she did not understand what all the fuss was about. She said she was not mutilated during her circumcision, didn’t bleed at all and felt nearly no pain during or after the procedure. “Mutilation is horrible, but it’s not true that it happens here” in Indonesia, Ms. Fitri said. “They cannot stop us. It’s our tradition.”",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/health/indonesia-female-genital-cutting-circumcision-unicef.html,health,The New York Times,health,1201
2018-09-24 00:00:00,2018,9.0,24,Apple Watch demand much higher than expected,"First-weekend demand for the new Apple Watch was much higher than expected, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a reputation for accuracy, particularly when it comes to predicting new products. The Apple Watch Series 4 has a larger screen and built-in cellular connectivity. It also has an electrocardiogram sensor, which will soon be able to monitor heart activity and can detect abnormalities and health issues, although that feature isn't available at launch. It comes in two sizes, 40 mm and 44 mm, making it much easier to see and use, said CNBC's Technology Product Editor Todd Haselton. Supply is somewhat constrained by the capacity of the companies building the watches, and Kuo doesn't expect shipments to really pick up until November. He also raised his 2018 shipment forecast from 18 million to 18.5 to 19.5 million units. The large iPhone XS Max is also outperforming its expectations and is selling over three times better than the XS. The gold and space-gray colors are more popular than the silver.

2019-01-14 23:59:00,2019,1.0,14,Ajit Pai Refuses to Brief Congress About Why Bounty Hunters Can Buy Cell Phone Location Data,"Monday, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai refused to meet with a Congressional committee to discuss the underground sale of real-time cell phone location data. Last week a Motherboard investigation revealed that cell phone providers and location aggregators have allowed real-time smartphone location data to be sold to bounty hunters, landlords, and used car salesman, among others. Soon after the story broke, Frank Pallone, the Chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, asked Pai for an emergency briefing on the issue. Monday, Pai refused that request, according to Pallone’s office.  “Today, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai refused to brief Energy and Commerce Committee staff on the real-time tracking of cell phone location, as reported by Motherboard last week,” Pallone said in an emailed statement. “In a phone conversation today, his staff asserted that these egregious actions are not a threat to the safety of human life or property that the FCC will address during the Trump shutdown.” Pallone added that using the shutdown as an excuse to not meet with Congress is a copout: “There’s nothing in the law that should stop the Chairman personally from meeting about this serious threat that could allow criminals to track the location of police officers on patrol, victims of domestic abuse, or foreign adversaries to track military personnel on American soil.” Jessica Rosenworcel, commissioner of the FCC, also reiterated her calls that the FCC needs to investigate. ""Your wireless phone location data is being sold by shady entities that you never gave permission to track you. That’s a personal and national security issue. No law stops the FCC from meeting with Congress to discuss this right now. It needs investigation,"" she tweeted Monday. In 2016, Congress gutted rules proposed by Pai’s predecessor that would have given consumers much more control over how their personal data could be used by telecom companies. Pai, a former telecom lobbyist, has generally taken a pro-industry stance at every turn, most notably with his vote to repeal federal net neutrality protections. The FCC did not respond to a request for comment. “The FCC once again appears to have dragged its feet in protection consumers,” Pallone wrote in his letter to Pai. “The FCC must take immediate action to ensure no wireless carrier is allowing the rampant disclosure of real-time location data.” Update: This piece has been updated to include comment from Jessica Rosenworcel, commissioner of the FCC.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mbymqp/ajit-pai-refuses-to-brief-congress-about-why-bounty-hunters-can-buy-cell-phone-location-data,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,400

Last week, the U.S. telecommunications regulator voted to propose requiring carriers to remove and replace equipment from Huawei from existing networks. The move could eliminate a key source of funding for Huawei’s biggest U.S. business - telecoms equipment. Huawei is expected to file a suit challenging the FCC decision next week in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, the Journal reported on.wsj.com/2L3zbta, citing people familiar with the matter. The company is expected to make an announcement about the legal case at its Shenzhen headquarters next week, the report added. “We don’t comment on speculation,” Huawei spokesman in Shenzhen told Reuters.

2017-11-26 17:32:57,2017,11.0,26,Twitter Says Blocking a New York Times Account Was ‘an Error’,"SAN FRANCISCO — As Twitter has tried to draw bright lines between what is acceptable and not acceptable on its platform, it has stumbled over them itself. The company was criticized after it froze the account of the actress Rose McGowan in October, when she included a phone number in one of her tweets about misconduct by the movie producer Harvey Weinstein. Then, after verifying a white supremacist this month, the company paused the entire verification program and now has new rules: the company can revoke verification for behavior both on and off the platform. This weekend, Twitter locked The New York Times’s international team account. The account was blocked on Saturday afternoon and unlocked about 24 hours later, on Sunday afternoon. The social network said that a @nytimesworld tweet violated Twitter’s rule against hateful conduct. The tweet promoted an article about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s apology to indigenous people in a Canadian province, where for much of the 20th century their children were compelled to attend boarding schools that separated them from their families and cultures. The post said, “Left out of an apology a decade ago, native people in Newfoundland and Labrador get an apology from Justin Trudeau.” In a statement, shortly after the Times account was restored, Twitter said: “After reviewing the account, it appears that one of our agents made an error. We have flagged this issue so that similar mistakes are not made going forward.” The company apologized “for any inconvenience this may have caused.” The New York Times international reporting team uses Twitter to promote its coverage to nearly two million followers, usually posting 50 to 100 tweets a day. Twitter has experienced increased public and government scrutiny over the past year. Earlier this month, Donald Trump’s personal account was disabled for 11 minutes, causing an uproar. Executives later discovered that it was a contractor who was leaving Twitter that day who had disabled the account. An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Newfoundland and Labrador. It is a single Canadian province, not two separate provinces.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/26/technology/twitter-says-blocking-a-new-york-times-account-was-an-error.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,344

In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for Pinterest said the company remains ""focused on building a visual discovery engine."" ""Upon first look, Hobbi appears to be a photo saving app that lacks the discoverability, search, and recommendations of Pinterest.

2018-03-30 00:00:00,2018,3.0,30,How to lose underarm 'batwing' fat ," (CNN)Chances are, if you are a woman over 40, you are probably familiar with the term ""batwings"" to describe the stubborn fat and sagging skin that starts appearing under your upper arms around this age.  Though it's difficult to completely avoid or correct, you don't have to toss your tank tops in the trash, either. There are several actions you can take to significantly improve their appearance. Flabby arms are due to a combination of factors associated with aging and genetics, including an increase in overall body fat mass (a greater portion of which localizes to the arms in some women due to genetics), loss of muscle mass in the arms associated with aging and reduced activity (causing the skin to hang more loosely on the upper arm) and a loss of elasticity in the skin due to both aging and sun damage from UV radiation, according to San Francisco dermatologist Dr. Richard Glogau. The most effective way to target flabby arms is through exercise. Losing body fat is essential if you are overweight and building up your triceps muscles. Those muscles on the backs of the arms, which you probably don't use that much in your day-to-day activity, can make a big difference in reducing flab there.  According to personal trainer Jennifer Cohen, you don't need a gym membership or special exercise equipment to target this muscle. Doing these three exercises two or three times each week and reducing your body fat if it is too high, you should notice a difference in your upper arms in four to six weeks.  Triceps step-ups Start in a plank position, holding your body as straight as possible, balancing on your toes and elbows. Make sure your abs are pulled into to your spine. From this position, go up on your hands one at a time and then quickly go back on to your elbows. Keep doing this for 30 seconds and rest for 30 to 90 seconds. Repeat three times (for a total of four), alternating the starting arm (right, left, right, left). If you are a beginner, you can do this exercise on your knees instead of your toes.  Triceps pushups Start in a plank position, this time balancing on your hands and toes. (Beginners can balance on hands and knees.) Hands should be on the ground, shoulder width apart. From this position, lower your body toward the floor while keeping your elbows brushed against your rib cage. Stop when your shoulders are in line with your elbows. (Beginners, stop when you feel you can no longer hold up your body weight.) Pause for a count of three and then press back into a plank pose. Aim for three sets of 10 to 15 repetitions, resting 30 to 90 seconds in between sets. Triceps dips  This exercise can be done of the side of a bench, couch or very sturdy chair. Sit and wrap your hands around the front of the bench with your knuckles facing forward. Slide your butt off the bench with your arms extended, and slowly lower your body until your elbows are bent to a 90-degree angle. Note that the closer your feet are to the bench, the easier this exercise will be. Go up and down for 30 seconds three times, resting 30 to 90 seconds in between each set. Alternatives When it comes to often pricey skin firming and tightening creams, don't waste your money, Glogau said, as science hasn't figure out a way to rebuild the protein in the skin responsible for elasticity.  You are much better off wearing sunscreen to prevent or avoid skin damage and using a good basic moisturizer to smooth out the top layer of skin.  Some procedures, including radiofrequency, ultrasound, infrared and lasers, may have a very modest effect on skin tightening by injuring the fibrous bands that attach skin to muscle, causing them to tighten up. Cold- and heat-based fat reduction procedures can help with fat loss and may result in modest skin tightening, but they are expensive, and individual results vary. Like with most things, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. To keep batwings at bay, the best thing you can do as you get older is to stay fit and lean and to wear sunscreen.

2019-03-26 00:00:00,2019,3.0,26,"EU Passes Article 11, Article 13 Copyright Rules in Final Vote","Photo:  GettyAmid widespread protests, online and off, the European Union approved a controversial new copyright directive on Tuesday. Two years in the making, the legislation is intended to give copyright holders more control over their work, but critics say it could hand more power to tech giants, stifle the free flow of information, and kill our beloved memes.European Parliament passed the copyright directive in a vote with 348 votes in favor, 274 against, and 36 abstentions. The new guidelines are the EU’s first major update to its copyright laws since 2001, and they’ve gone through a circuitous and confusing legislative process that only caught the public’s attention last summer. Lawmakers who opposed the directive attempted to remove the most contentious pieces of the legislation before holding a final vote on Tuesday but were overruled by just five members of Parliament.The directive aims to empower news publishers and artists against big tech platforms like Facebook and Google as they profit from others’ work. As such, it has seen high profile support from big names like Lady Gaga and Paul McCartney. For many, making it more difficult for tech giants to make money and gather traffic from copyright violations sounds good in theory. But experts like the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, have taken issue with two pieces of the legislation that they warn could have enormous unintended consequences.The whole situation is quite complicated, and we’ve covered it in further detail before, but the basic principals are fairly simple. Article 11, or what’s come to be known as the “link tax,” requires web platforms to obtain a license to link to or use snippets of news articles. This is intended to help news organizations gain some revenue from services like Google News that display a headline or a portion of an article that it suggests to readers. Article 13 requires a web platform to make their “best efforts” to obtain licenses to copyrighted material before it is uploaded to their platforms and changes the current standard of requiring platforms to simply comply with copyright takedown requests. The expectation is that platforms will have to use imperfect upload filters to deal with the flood of user-generated content, and the most draconian moderation practices will become the new normal. In both cases, critics argue that the directive is too vague and efforts to fix the issues are shortsighted.The primary concern is that the legislation will do the exact opposite of what it’s intended to do. Publishers will suffer as it becomes more difficult to share articles or discover news, and instead of paying for a license, companies like Google will just stop displaying news results as they’ve done when similar rules were tried in Spain. Smaller platforms or startups that allow users to upload content, meanwhile, won’t have a chance of competing with the Facebooks of the world that can afford massive moderation operations and still fail to get it right. The idea of fair use will become null and void as companies decide it’s not worth the headache to allow a re-purposed meme and risk legal liability.MEP Julia Reda has been one of the most vocal critics of the directive and tweeted this morning that it’s a “dark day for internet freedom.” Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia, tweeted that the internet user “lost a huge battle today” in European Parliament. “The free and open internet is being quickly handed over to corporate giants at the expense of ordinary people,” Wales wrote. “This is not about helping artists, it is about empowering monopolistic practices.”For those who oppose the directive, there’s a small bit of hope in the fact that each country in the EU now has two years to take the legislation and improve it before its implemented in their country. But as the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Cory Doctorow has pointed out, that’s also an issue. “The problem is that EU-wide services will struggle to present different versions of their sites to people based on which country they’re in, and so there’s a good reason to believe that online services will converge on the most restrictive national implementation of the Directive,” Doctorow wrote.The final tally of how each member of Parliament voted on the directive will be posted here. Europeans who want to sure the internet remains as open as possible will need to maintain pressure on their governments as this all gets worked out. This legislation slipped under the radar for a long time, but now that it has gained so much attention, no one should think that the fight to make it better is over.[The Independent]",https://gizmodo.com/a-dark-day-copyright-law-that-threatens-the-internet-a-1833570802,Tech Policy,Gizmodo,technology,767

2016-07-23 18:00:00,2016,7.0,23,Ancient Poop Sticks Prove the Silk Road Spread Disease,"The Silk Road, an ancient network of trade routes spanning from China to Mediterranean Europe, was once critical to trade and the transmission of ideas between the East and West. It helped turn Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity into truly world religions, satiated the Roman desire for Asian silks and spices, turned Baghdad into a world capital, and if a team of researchers from Cambridge are right, spread infectious diseases across continents. The team was lead by biological anthropologists Piers Mitchell and Hui-Yuan Yeh, who used microscopy to analyze personal hygiene sticks discovered in a latrine at a once thriving Silk Road relay station in China to determine that the trade route was used to spread disease. As detailed in Mitchell and Yeh's recent report in the Journal of Archaeological Sciences, these 2000-year old hygiene sticks (basically a stick wrapped in cloth used to wipe one's ass) had traces of preserved feces on them which contained eggs from four types of parasitic worms: roundworm, whipworm, tapeworm and Chinese liver fluke. ""When I first saw the Chinese liver fluke egg down the microscope I knew that we had made a momentous discovery,"" said Yeh. ""Our study is the first to use archaeological evidence from a site on the Silk Road to demonstrate that travelers were taking infectious diseases with them over these huge distances."" The presence of the Chinese liver fluke was ""momentous"" because it was discovered in a latrine on the border of the Taklamakan desert which is about 1500 kilometers away from its nearest natural environment in China. This suggests that it was brought to the area by traders traveling enormous distances on the Silk Road. The liver fluke can cause severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, and even liver cancer, and as such the researchers were surprised to find that traders were able to travel such long distances while carrying the parasite. This is big news, as researchers have previously suggested that other diseases such as bubonic plague, anthrax and leprosy were also transmitted by way of traders on the Silk Road. Until the Cambridge research, however, their assertions lacked robust evidence. ""Until now there has been no proof that the Silk Road was responsible for the spread of infectious diseases,"" said Mitchell. ""They could instead have spread between China and Europe via India to the south, or via Mongolia and Russia to the north. This proves for the first time that travelers along the Silk Road really were responsible for the spread of infectious disease along this route in the past.""",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mg79a4/ancient-poop-silk-road-disease,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,421
2017-09-08 12:00:00,2017,9.0,8,"We See You, Fake Service Dog Owners","I get it: You want to fly with your dog. You want to overrule your landlord's anti-pet policy, and it would be nice to bring your fur-baby into a restaurant with you. I have a dog too, and I certainly don't want her flying in the belly of a plane, subject to cold temperatures, shifting luggage, and the whims and inconsistencies of airline pet handling. But you know who else wants to spend extra time with their dog? The visually impaired, who deserve the opportunity to live a more navigable life. Wheelchair-bound individuals who simply want more autonomy. Those who have PTSD or epilepsy and require a specially trained helper to get them through an episode or panic or seizure. Disabled people bring dogs with them because they depend on those highly-trained animals not only for independence, but survival. That's why the Americans with Disabilities Act was legislated in 1990. People with legitimate needs required the use of dogs—again, highly-trained ones—to help them live ""normal"" lives, and this need was so great it had to be recognized by the federal government. So when I was waiting for my flight at the Albuquerque Sunport, I was shocked to witness a large-breed hound-type with a bright red vest boasting service animal status squat down and unrelentingly piss all over the tile floor. The owner quickly flung his jacket to the ground, soaking up the smelly mess, while looking around to see if anyone noticed. The thing is, a true service animal, one with years of training, would not have made that mistake. And even if they had, anyone whose daily life consists of managing that animal would know to bring their accidental-mess-kit, like the one I was required to carry for two years while raising and training a puppy with Guide Dogs for the Blind (GDB). This was no isolated incident. In my years as a trainer I've seen countless vest-clad dogs barking, biting, peeing, jumping, and generally doing things that even a mildly-trained dog wouldn't do. During my time as a puppy raiser, the visually impaired people that joined my local GDB group repeatedly shared stories about non-service dogs that distracted their guides in places where pets were otherwise not allowed. Outside recently published a collection of data and anecdotes supporting the reality and severity of this problem. But apparently for many, the need to bring a beloved pet into dog-free places supersedes the survival needs of the disabled. The primary ADA loophole that people exploit is about the legality of questioning the legitimacy of a service animal: ""Staff cannot ask about the person's disability, require medical documentation, require a special identification card or training documentation for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task."" While this rule maintains a level of respect and privacy for the disabled, it makes it really easy to pretend your pet is a specially trained service dog by calling it an emotional support animal, even though ""dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the ADA."" Whereas someone with PTSD would have a service dog that is specifically one-on-one trained to sense and respond to an oncoming anxiety attack, an ESA simply offers comfort by virtue of being there. But to an onlooker—or more importantly, someone who could lose their job for refusing to accommodate a service animal team—there is heavy incentivization to tolerate the presence of all dogs, trained and otherwise, because questioning the dog's service legitimacy would be breaking the law. A law which, by the way, exists so that disabled people wouldn't have to be further called out or stigmatized. Yet people are enthusiastic about pushing the boundaries of this law to meet their personal desires. And it's a more serious problem than just dismissing these people as insensitive. First off, as I mentioned, untrained animals are really good at testing the training of even the most excellent service dogs. When a dog is the literal eyeballs of a human being, distraction can be death. If a regular dog is allowed to distract a service animal in a confined area, this could mean it might miss the signs of its person's seizures, or send their person walking into a doorframe, hitting their head. That's why it's a major faux pas as a human to touch or get the attention of a working dog. Which brings me to my second point: Most people with ostensible service animals that are neither trained nor certified will often allow and encourage people to interact with their dog. They wear the Service Dog vest, appear in places where most dogs can't go, and confuse the hell out of people when they later encounter a true service dog. Children, who struggle with animal boundaries to begin with, really get thrown for a loop when they can pet one vested dog but not the next. Third, vendors don't enjoy having raucous canines in their establishments. I'm sure the Albuquerque airport isn't thrilled that there's a partially sopped up puddle of dog pee on their floor that someone now has to clean up, just because one person felt the rules don't to apply to them. This leads businesses to pressure legislators against ADA rules, which only ends up hurting the people it was created to protect. This is not to say emotional support animals shouldn't be a thing. Many people benefit from their companionship and when registered for legitimate reasons, they can provide incredible therapy. It's when pet dogs are costumed up as service animals under the banner of an ESA that it becomes an ethical dilemma, hurting not only the disabled but people who genuinely need ESAs as well. Hell, I trained my own dog using GDB standards to assist with my diagnosed PTSD episodes, and even she doesn't meet the service dog certification requirements, so I don't parade her around like she does—even though she's better trained than most pups out there. Conflating indistinguishable emotional support animals with service dogs means that a few people gain a minor benefit at the expense of the safety and security of disabled people. And that's a pretty ugly equation.

2019-12-07 00:00:00,2019,12.0,7,How to stop Google Maps from tracking your location,"If you don't configure Google Maps properly, it will automatically keep a detailed log of everywhere you go, whether you're walking, driving or even flying anywhere in the world. It's wildly detailed down to the minute, and can show where you were at any moment in time. I'll show you how to automatically delete it. That information can be helpful for you. You might want to look back and see where you went during a past trip, for example. Or you might want Google to know how long it typically takes to drive somewhere you go often. Still, it's kind of creepy to have years and years of that data stored on Google's servers. Here's a sliver of the places I went during June, for example: But, over the summer, Google began rolling out a feature that lets you automatically delete your saved location date either every 18 months or every 3 months. Anything older than that is automatically deleted, so Google won't know about those stops you made in Las Vegas last year. Oddly, it's not where Google normally puts this setting, on your Google Account page. Instead, you need to dig through your settings in Google Maps. Here's what to do: I recommend forcing Google to delete after every 3 months. There isn't much reason to hold on to your history for much longer than that, though you can select 18 months if you disagree. Now, anything older than the time you set will automatically be deleted and will continue to be deleted by Google as time goes on.

2017-10-10 17:37:00,2017,10.0,10,The US Government Now Says Life Begins at Conception [Updated],"Update 4/20/18: The final strategic plan does indeed define life as starting at conception by saying ""HHS accomplishes its mission through programs and initiatives that cover a wide spectrum of activities, serving and protecting Americans at every stage of life, from conception."" It is also reiterated in strategic goal 3, which states that ""a core component of the HHS mission is the dedication to serve all Americans from conception to natural death."" The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the branch of the government tasked with enhancing the health and well-being of Americans, has released its draft strategic plan for 2018 to 2022, and that plan defines life as beginning at conception. Gynecologist Jen Gunter explained on her blog how the Trump administration could use this language as a way to attack contraception, abortion, and IVF, and how additional language about religious freedom could let religious healthcare providers discriminate against their patients. This document was apparently published before HHS Secretary Tom Price (himself a staunch anti-choice legislator) resigned over his use of private planes. It's a lot to unpack. First, the definition of life stuff. The current HHS strategic plan for 2014 to 2018 says: The new draft says (emphasis added): Conception as the start of life is mentioned again in goal #3, which also seems to reflect the anti-euthanasia views of former Americans United for Life president and current HHS assistant secretary of public affairs, Charmaine Yoest: This science-defying, anti-choice language shouldn't surprise anyone. In a September 2016 letter, Donald Trump said he'd enlisted the president of anti-choice group Susan B. Anthony List as the president of his campaign's ""Pro Life Coalition"" and promised to do several things: nominate pro-life justices to the Supreme Court, sign a 20-week abortion ban into law, ""defund"" Planned Parenthood, and make permanent an amendment that prohibits taxpayer funding from being used to pay for abortions. Both Americans United for Life and Susan B. Anthony List believe that copper IUDs and emergency contraception cause abortions, which medical experts say is not the case; they can prevent ovulation, prevent fertilization, and, in some cases, the copper IUD can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterine lining. Implantation is the medical definition of when pregnancy begins. Gunter points out that if life begins at conception as far as HHS is concerned, it means the department could label these forms of contraception as abortifacients and no longer cover them for low-income people with Medicaid. (Medicaid falls under the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which is an agency of HHS.) This, of course, would be in addition to private employers being able to opt out of birth control coverage for religious or moral reasons, per a rule issued on Friday. Redefining the start of life is also a step toward even more restrictions on abortion if HHS says a fetus is no longer a fetus, but rather an unborn child, to use another phrase popular among anti-choicers. Objective 3.3 says HHS will ""Protect women and their unborn children from harm."" Reproductive medicine physician Kristen Cain pointed out that this kind of language reflects the personhood movement, where even embryos created for in-vitro fertilization would be considered people with full legal protection under the Constitution. Roe v. Wade protects women's right to abortion until a fetus is viable outside the womb; only after that can states enact restrictions. If HHS says that life begins at conception, it could lend legitimacy to personhood bills like HR 586, The Sanctity of Human Life Act, introduced in January. But wait, there's more! The document is also littered with references to faith-based care and objective 1.3 includes a subsection devoted to ""removing barriers for faith-based and other community-based providers."" It basically means that doctors in HHS programs would be able to discriminate based on their religious beliefs. This section promises that HHS will: Gunter writes, ""Yes, the agency tasked with enhancing the 'health and well-being of Americans' now believes that certain religious beliefs are more important than health care. This could apply to contraception, abortion, vaccines, addiction medicine, sexually transmitted infection screening, and transgender care just to name a few."" Politico reported on this draft strategic plan on October 3 in explaining how Price's conservative vision will likely remain in place at HHS, but the story failed to capture much attention. They noted: During his tenure, Price was a big proponent of faith-based care, notoriously touting faith-based programs for addiction while showing less support for proven treatments like medication-assisted therapy. Doctors ripped him a new one over those comments. Gunter concludes that this draft plan is a draft: People can make comments online for every section where it says ""share your thoughts."" Update 10/16/17: People can also email, fax, and mail comments on the draft plan to HHS.

2018-08-14 00:00:00,2018,8.0,14,'Detox tea': What's behind the Teami craze sweeping Instagram?,"This story contains profanity and language that some readers might find offensive.  (CNN)They call her ""Cardi Bardi, banging body / Spicy mami, hot tamale"" -- and she's got an image to maintain. Cardi B would like for her 30 million Instagram followers to believe she's able to do that thanks in part to Teami, ""all-natural loose leaf teas"" that are sold online and endorsed by a growing chorus of high-profile celebrities, who echo some questionable health claims about the products. The rapper, who skyrocketed to fame last year with her smash hit ""Bodak Yellow,"" gave birth to her first child on July 10. She now says she's trying to lose her baby weight and get back in shape, like many new moms. But no surprise to her legions of fans, Cardi is doing that in her own way: online and unfiltered. ""Ya ain't seeing my body till i snap back,"" she wrote on Instagram late last month. ""This @teamiblends gonna do the work !!!"" The post did not contain a hashtag (such as #ad or #spon) indicating that it had been sponsored, as encouraged by the Federal Trade Commission. Representatives for Cardi B did not respond to an email asking whether she received any compensation from Teami for her post. Teami also declined to say whether it paid Cardi for the social media shout-out. The very next night brought another Teami endorsement, this time from one of Instagram's most followed accounts, Kylie Jenner (with 113 million followers and counting). Jenner, who Forbes says is poised to become the world's youngest self-made billionaire, posted: ""#ad I started the @teamiblends 30 day detox program because they promote a healthy lifestyle and it is important for me to feel my best. I'm on day 7 right now... I have way more energy and it is like a magic tea to get rid of tummy bloat."" Celebrities getting paid (or not) to endorse products is nothing new. In fact, it's how many of them make a large percentage of their money. But medical experts say consumers should be encouraged to seek out additional information before purchasing any product with purported health benefits. Teami is not the only detox or weight loss tea touted by the rich and famous. Singers Nicki Minaj and Britney Spears have gushed about MateFit, Kim and the rest of the Kardashian crew have posted about Fit Tea and Flat Tummy tea, and actress Hilary Duff has called Lyfe Tea ""a secret weapon."" What are detox teas, exactly? ""If you take a really close look at it, these teas are just a bunch of herbs,"" said nutritionist Lisa Drayer, who writes about diet and nutrition for CNN. ""Some contain caffeine; others may function as a diuretic or laxative. And so any of the weight loss that occurs is due to water weight, and it would quickly be regained once people either stop [drinking] the tea or start hydrating again."" Teami claims that its Skinny Tea contains a potpourri of ingredients including oolong, yerba mate, lime leaf extract, lotus leaf, ginger root and rhubarb root. Teami's Colon Cleanse Tea purportedly contains senna leaf and root, hawthorn berry extract, lotus leaf, lime leaf and extract, psyllium husk seed, phaseolus calcaratus seed, rhubarb root, poria cocos stem bark and valerian root. Oolong tea is a partially fermented, caffeinated tea that is a cross between black and green tea, Drayer said. Senna acts as a laxative and will cause more bowel movements. ""I don't know the amount they use, but yerba mate is known for its caffeine content, which can ... perhaps speed metabolism in the short term,"" Drayer said. ""In large amounts, it certainly can be an issue for those with high blood pressure or any heart issues."" Garcinia cambogia and valerian root, which are ingredients in many of these weight-loss products, have been associated with drug-induced liver injury and in some cases liver failure, said Dr. Dina Halegoua-De Marzio, a gastroenterologist and director of the Jefferson Fatty Liver Center in Philadelphia. Researchers acknowledge that the liver-damaging potential of garcinia cambogia is debated and warrants further study. Though the exact concentrations of these substances are not listed on the companies' websites, the US National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health says that taking garcinia cambogia for 12 weeks or less should be safe for most healthy people. The National Institutes of Health also reports that instances of liver toxicity from valerian root are very rare. Do detox teas work? The lack of regulation of the ingredients in these teas is a concern for many doctors. ""The FDA does not regulate these substances,"" said Halegoua-De Marzio, who is also an assistant professor of medicine at the Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University. ""Really, they can put anything they want in these teas. They can make any claim that they want, and it doesn't have to be supported by any evidence. That makes these very, very dangerous."" Adi Arezzini, Teami's co-founder and CEO, maintains that her company is ""definitely transparent."" ""All of the ingredients are 100% plant based and 100% natural,"" she wrote in an email to CNN. ""All of the ingredients we use are written on our product labels!"" MateFit, Fit Tea, Flat Tummy and Lyfe Tea did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. The sellers of these supplements tend to use general terms to describe their actions like ""supports a healthy digestive system,"" Drayer said, contrasting that with drugs that have scientific backing that can assert they ""lower blood pressure or cholesterol"" and other more specific benefits. Halegoua-De Marzio, who is a liver specialist, has seen an increase in patients asking about ways to detoxify their bodies, an ability many of these weight loss companies profess to offer. ""And my answer is, it's an organ,"" she said. ""There's no way really to detoxify an organ. The liver does a very good job of it on its own."" Are there any risks to detox teas? The worst side effect someone may experience is liver failure, according to Halegoua-De Marzio, but that would be extremely rare. More common side effects include increased heart rate, high blood pressure, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. ""In my mind, it's not an effective treatment, so it's not worth any potential risk,"" she said. Users ""really should talk to their physicians about any supplements. Because even beyond them not being effective and my safety concerns, some of these supplements can actually interact with other medications that someone may be on."" Halegoua-De Marzio said valerian root can interact with muscle relaxants, sleep and anxiety medicines, as well as antidepressants. Dried green tea leaves contain vitamin K, which can increase blood clotting, she said, and large amounts of vitamin K may interfere with some blood thinners. Nevertheless, Halegoua-De Marzio and Drayer agreed that the average healthy person will probably be fine drinking the teas for a short period of time. ""We know by now that there are no quick fixes when it comes to weight loss,"" Drayer said. ""You may get a temporary drop in pounds, which can certainly be motivating on a psychological level, but that's as far as it's going to go. In terms of real weight loss, it takes portion control [and] changing your eating habits."" The key to sustained success, Drayer said, is ""just making one or two changes a week until it becomes habit.""

2016-10-11 00:00:00,2016,10.0,11,Self-driving cars hit the road for first public test in the UK,"Self-driving cars — or more accurately self-driving pods — took to the road in a city outside of London Tuesday in what organizers are calling the first public test of driverless cars in the UK. To be sure, it was at extremely low speeds in a sparsely trafficked area, but was still celebrated as a milestone by Great Britain, which has lagged behind the US in testing self-driving cars. The autonomous Lutz Pathfinder Pod, developed by the Oxford Robotics Institute and a university spinout company Oxbotica, navigated its way around a small area in the southern English town of Milton Keynes at 5 mph, turning corners and stopping as pedestrians crossed its path, according to Reuters. The test was overseen by the government-sponsored Transport Systems Catapult, a non-profit that funds innovation projects in the UK. The egg-shaped vehicle, with its purple trim, electric battery, and spinning LIDAR sensors, looked more like one of Google’s self-driving prototypes than any of the more traditional looking driverless cars that are currently being tested in the US. It was the first of several tests planned for the UK in the coming months, since the government gave the green light to autonomous vehicles trials on public roads last year. The Meridian shuttle in the southern London borough of Greenwich has been testing its vehicles, which look like elongated golf carts, on private roads for over a year. Another project is run by Venturer and will be operating out of Bristol. A spokesperson for Oxbotica said their vehicle was the first to be tested in an “unsegregated public area.” Much like the US government, the UK has said it wants to take a ""light touch, non-regulatory approach"" to trials of autonomous vehicles. The plan is to encourage companies to put more self-driving cars on the roads by 2020, with the goal of building an industry to serve a global market that’s worth £900 million ($1.1 trillion) by 2025. For now, the goal of weird-looking, driverless pods like the Lutz Pathfinder Pod is to acclimate the public to the concept of self-driving vehicles, organizers say. ""If people can see that these vehicles are capable of driving themselves they can gain trust in them,” Neil Fulton, a program director at the Transport Systems Catapult told Reuters. But where it goes from there will be the true test. Organizers say they want 40 driverless pods operating in Milton Keynes by next year. Meanwhile, carmakers Jaguar Land Rover and Volvo are spearheading their own driverless car projects in the UK, as they seek to head off technology companies that are testing autonomous vehicles like Google and Uber.",https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/11/13243134/self-driving-car-pods-uk-england-lutz-pathfinder-test,Tech,The Verge,technology,437
2018-02-23 19:30:00,2018,2.0,23,Ethereum Scammers Posing as Tech Celebrities Are Running Rampant On Twitter,"Scammers are tricking gullible Twitter users into sending their hard-earned ether (Ethereum’s in-house cryptocurrency) to random addresses with the empty promise of a hefty giveaway. It’s the latest chapter in the neverending saga of scammers exploiting the cryptocurrency gold rush, and the so-called Bitcoin or Ethereum FOMO, or fear of missing out on an investment. In this case, the scammers are out in the open impersonating well-known figures in the cryptocurrency community or the tech world, such as Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, Elon Musk, and John McAfee. The scammers often reply to tweets from the real accounts they are impersonating, in an apparent attempt to catch distracted users who might not notice that the Twitter handle is different, or that the account lacks a verified checkmark. I visited these links and checked the Ethereum addresses they advertise. If someone clicks on the short URLs, they are taken to a page that looks like this: To further deceive people, those pages includes what looks like a log of Ether payments, both incoming and outgoing. But the logs don’t appear to be real. The scammers also appear to be using other fake Twitter accounts to make it look like they’re giving out ether. The below screenshot of an Ethereum address used by the scammers—and linked to in the tweets soliciting money—shows outgoing payments, but it is likely forged. If you check the address’s balance on a legitimate blockchain explorer, there are no outgoing payments, only incoming. This particular scammer has gathered more than 40 Ether (roughly $35,000) as of this writing. If you’re keeping track at home, these Twitter accounts posted the link that lead to that address. Buterin himself has called out these type of scams, begging his followers not to trust “anyone who asks you for ETH on Twitter.” “Twitter is terrible, part 629: go to this link, but with the space removed. Notice how it is not in fact my tweet,” Buterin tweeted on Friday, showing how easy it is to trick people. Twitter did not immediately respond to a series of questions asking what the company is doing to stop these scams. On Friday, scammers were apparently using a new trick to—presumably—circumvent Twitter filters: using a Cyrillic letter that looks like an “r” when posting the word “address,” as malware researcher Mikko Hypponen noted in a tweet on Friday. Please, do not believe people who are literally promising free money in exchange for your money. They’re probably not going to give it to you. In the last few months, we’ve seen countless examples of these scams. Some scammers impersonate well-known professors on Slack, others even tried—and failed—to scam our own cryptocurrency expert in residence and editor Jordan Pearson. More sophisticated crooks have been targeting people’s online accounts directly, hijacking their SIM cards and stealing their passwords. So be careful with that too and enable two-factor with an app (and not with your cellphone number) if you use exchanges like Coinbase or Gemini.

2018-03-22 15:29:11,2018,3.0,22,Kevin’s Week in Tech: Zuckerberg’s Answers to Privacy Scandal Raise More Questions,"Bits Each week, Kevin Roose, technology columnist at The New York Times, discusses developments in the tech industry, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. You know those weeks when crazy things happen at work, your entire schedule goes haywire and the concept of a good night’s sleep starts to resemble a hazy and futile dream, like full employment or healthy pizza? Well, folks, this was one of those weeks. On Friday night, when Facebook published a blog post saying that it had suspended Cambridge Analytica for misappropriating user data — a post that was intended to pre-empt articles by The New York Times and The Observer of London about that very subject, which were published the next day — it became clear that this was a new kind of Facebook privacy scandal. It has already led to congressional inquiries and user revolts, thrusting the company into the kind of chaos it had not seen in its 14-year history. On Wednesday, after a five-day silence and lots of speculation about his whereabouts, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, finally re-emerged with a Facebook post and an interview with my colleague Sheera Frenkel and me, among others. You can read the transcript of our interview here, and read our article about Facebook’s horrible week here. We had only about 30 minutes on the phone with Mr. Zuckerberg, but we managed to get him to address several important topics: the Cambridge Analytica mess, Facebook’s lax data policies, its plans to clamp down on third-party developer access and notify users whose data was misused, election interference (including previously unreported Macedonian attempts to interfere in last year’s Alabama special election) and Facebook’s broader responsibility as a global power. But Mr. Zuckerberg’s responses also raised more questions. Here, for example, is how he answered a question about Facebook’s business model, which is based on selling advertisers and developers the ability to target Facebook users based on their personal data. Roose: Is the basic economic model of Facebook, in which users provide data that Facebook uses to help advertisers and developers to better target potential customers and users — do you feel like that works, given what we now know about the risks? Zuckerberg: Yeah, so this is a really important question. The thing about the ad model that is really important that aligns with our mission is that — our mission is to build a community for everyone in the world and to bring the world closer together. And a really important part of that is making a service that people can afford. A lot of the people, once you get past the first billion people, can’t afford to pay a lot. Therefore, having it be free and have a business model that is ad-supported ends up being really important and aligned. Now, over time, might there be ways for people who can afford it to pay a different way? That’s certainly something we’ve thought about over time. But I don’t think the ad model is going to go away, because I think fundamentally, it’s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use, and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free. Narrowly, it may be true that being free and ad supported helps Facebook achieve its goals of connecting billions of people to its services. Facebook has developed a number of ways to make itself cheaper and easier to access — including, in some countries, effectively subsidizing use through its Free Basics program, which allows people to use Facebook without its counting toward their data plans. But it’s not clear this approach has served society well. Especially in countries like Myanmar, where Facebook was recently blamed by United Nations investigators for fueling ethnic violence against the Rohingya, it’s possible that having a slightly higher barrier to entry would be a net good, even if it cost Facebook some users in the short term. (And it’s not even clear that it would. People already pay for their cellphones and data plans all over the world, and might be willing to part with a small fee to keep using their favorite social network.) Switching to a subscription model wouldn’t fix all of Facebook’s problems overnight. There would still be foreign actors trying to interfere in elections, false news and divisive content intending to sway public opinion, and innumerable other issues. But moving away from an ad-supported model would make the network harder to exploit. (Bot networks are less effective on subscription platforms, for example.) And it would lessen the company’s incentive to sell out its users’ privacy to advertisers. Facebook has already shown a willingness to try new models. WhatsApp, for example, makes money by charging businesses for an enterprise product that lets them message their customers. And this week, in an announcement immediately buried by an avalanche of other news about the company, Facebook said it was experimenting with a subscription model that would allow popular creators to charge $5 per month for access to their posts. What if all of Facebook cost $5 per month to use, and certain types of divisive and exploitable ad categories and behaviors were removed from the network entirely? Would users revolt en masse, and decide to colonize some other free social media app? Would Facebook collapse without a pipeline of advertising dollars? Maybe. But being smaller might not be a bad thing. If we’ve learned anything from this year’s troubles, it’s this: Facebook’s platform problems multiply as it gets bigger and more complex, but its ability to deal with those problems stays fairly constant. Zuckerberg might be dedicated to fixing Facebook’s problems, but unless he addresses its biggest problem of all — its enormous scale, paired with a business model that requires the company to monetize its users’ private data to the greatest extent possible — there’s only so much he can do.

User passwords are typically protected with encryption (a process known as hashing), but a string of errors led certain Facebook-branded apps to leave passwords accessible to as many as 20,000 company employees. Between 200 million and 600 million Facebook users are believed to have been affected, according to Krebs, which first reported the security flaw. Facebook confirmed the issue in a blog post, titled “Keeping Passwords Secure,” and it said the company identified the problem in January as part of a security review. Facebook says it has fixed the issue and will notify everyone affected. According to Facebook, there’s no evidence that plain text passwords were exposed outside of the company or that they were abused internally. As a result, users won’t be required to reset their passwords. The issue impacted “hundreds of millions of Facebook Lite users, tens of millions of other Facebook users, and tens of thousands of Instagram users,” the company says. Although there’s no evidence of abuse, at least 2,000 Facebook employees searched through the files containing passwords, though it’s not clear what for. The password logging reportedly started as early as 2012. This is the latest in a string of bad security issues for Facebook. In October, a hacker was able to access personal information from 29 million accounts after stealing login tokens. Before that, hacked private messages from 81,000 users were found to have been put up for sale.

2016-05-16 12:00:00,2016,5.0,16,We’re Taking a Break from Slack. Here’s Why,"Like many publications, Motherboard uses Slack to coordinate our daily operation. We send more than 5,000 messages a week in eight Slack channels. Reporters and contributors pitch story ideas and ask for edits in Slack. We have a room where people share interesting links. We have a room for voting on headlines. It's a marvelous thing to be able to talk to everyone on your team in one place. Most of our team is in New York, but we have an editor and reporter in Toronto, an editor and reporter in London, two writers in the San Francisco area, and an editor in Oregon. Our video producers are on the floor below us, and we have several regular contributors who work from home. Slack has been an indispensible tool. However, we noticed that more and more time was being diverted to Slack. It wasn't just joking around, although there was plenty of that. We'd find ourselves spending 30 minutes in a spirited debate about a story we all seemed interested in, but then… no one would write something for the site. It was as if the Slack discussion had replaced the blogging process. Talking about a topic with our colleagues fulfilled the urge to publish. The other recurring issue with Slack is that it's just baseline distracting. People are always talking, often directly to you, and they usually expect an immediate response. Writers and editors need unbroken blocks of time to work. Slack makes that difficult. This week, Motherboard is going cold turkey. That's right—we're cutting off Slack. Writers will talk directly to their editors. We'll talk via face-to-face conversation, the phone, Google Hangouts, and Gchat. (Why is Gchat allowed?, you might ask. Because Gchat is optimized for one-on-one conversations, and doesn't have persistent rooms.) We're hoping that cutting off Slack will give reporters a chance to refocus on writing stories and encourage more in-depth conversations with editors. After this experiment we'll reevaluate where we really need to use Slack (or any group chat app—we've also used Hipchat, Campfire, and Cryptocat), and how we can restructure in order to use our walled-off conversations in Slack to facilitate our mission of covering tech and science for cyberpunks.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/aekk85/were-taking-a-break-from-slack-heres-why,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,366
2016-06-16 18:00:00,2016,6.0,16,Why Climate Change Could Benefit Parts of Canada’s Boreal Forest,"The boreal forest in Quebec, which is full of black spruce trees, is absolutely huge—it's ""about the size of Spain,"" Loïc D'Orangeville, a postdoctoral researcher at the Université du Québec à Montréal, told me. While the rest of the world grapples with the damaging effects of climate change—wildfires, drought, the list goes on—northeastern parts of the boreal forest could actually stand to benefit, according to his latest research. In fact, he argues that Quebec's massive boreal forest could provide a much-needed ""refuge"" for plants and animals, as much of the continent gets hotter and drier, creating a latitudinal shift that drives the ranges of various species farther north.  D'Orangeville's findings are somewhat surprising, especially given the fierce wildfires we've seen this year in western Canada, most notably around Fort McMurray (and, yes, extreme wildfires are linked to climate change). But, while the boreal forest in western North America is expected to be under an increasing amount of strain—hot, dry weather creates conditions ripe for forest fires—the picture in the east is a bit different.  For one thing, warmer temperatures will bring a longer growing season to parts of the north, where it's relatively limited. And Quebec already receives from more than twice the mean annual precipitation compared to central and western regions: that extra moisture will create a much-needed buffer from increased evaporation, D'Orangeville said.  Even so, until now, direct evidence that eastern parts of Canada could fare better as temperatures warm has been fairly hard to come by. That's because most of the research has been done using satellite data. In this new study, published Thursday in Science, D'Orangeville and his colleagues gathered and analyzed tree-ring data from a whopping 16,450 trees, across 583,000 km² of dense Quebec forest.  Black spruce is commercially important in Quebec, he said (D'Orangeville is also associated with Indiana University), so it's closely monitored across the province. ""That's why we could access a data set [of this size],"" he told me. ""You don't normally get to play with a data set this big. It really is amazing."" In the analysis, they found that the trees in northern areas—between latitudes of 49 and 52˚N—will thrive: up to 80 percent of the forest there will see favourable growth between 2040 and 2070. (Above the 52nd parallel, temperatures are quite cold and trees get sparser, so the same effects won't be seen.)  ""It tells us there's still going to be a good part of the black spruce range that's favourable habitat for [certain] species in coming decades,"" he said. ""But that's only one side of the story.""  The truth is that even Quebec's mighty forest won't be protected from the onslaught of climate change—not really. Wildfires will move farther north, D'Orangeville said. And insect plagues will continue to spread. (Quebec is in the grips of a long-running budworm epidemic, he noted. These bugs feed on various tree species, including black spruce.)  It will be important to identify regions around the world that could become buttresses against climate change, D'Orangeville said—and Quebec's forest could be one of them. But the truth is that no part of the world is really safe from climate change. It impacts us all.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3dav4b/climate-change-could-benefit-parts-of-canadas-boreal-forest-quebec-science-black-spruce,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,530
2018-01-10 00:00:00,2018,1.0,10,College students see drowsy driving as legally safe,"Reuters Health - Although driving while sleepy is as dangerous as driving while intoxicated, college students may see it as unavoidable and not legally risky, a small study suggests. In the U.S. alone, drowsy drivers are involved in nearly 300,000 car crashes each year, including 6,400 that result in deaths, according to the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety. “Drowsy driving is increasingly being recognized as a source of crashes and deaths on highways,” said study leader Dr. Kenneth Beck of the University of Maryland in College Park. Beck and colleagues conducted four focus groups with 26 undergraduate college students in 2016. Students were surveyed about their driving habits, perceptions about risky driving behaviors (such as driving while drunk or using a phone), and strategies to improve traffic safety around drowsy driving in particular. Overall, participants considered themselves safe drivers, especially with passengers in the car. At the same time, they viewed drowsy driving as less risky from a legal perspective than drunk driving or driving while under the influence of drugs or medications. Many participants acknowledged the crash risks associated with drowsy driving but felt relatively immune to legal risks and were unaware of laws against drowsy driving. They also questioned the enforceability of these laws. Without a biochemical test (such as one used for drunk driving, for example), they felt it would be difficult to validate drowsiness. “You can do a test and say . . . they were drunk, or when you’re texting and driving . . . you can see that they just sent this last text message at this time,” one student said. “But when you’re drowsy . . . it’s kinda hard to tell.” Most students had experienced drowsy driving incidents, including crashes or near-misses, most often while driving alone and in the early morning or late at night. They described times they woke themselves up by opening the window to get fresh air, playing the radio loudly, chewing gum and talking along with the radio. To improve messaging about drowsy driving, the students said depicting graphic consequences would be effective for young drivers, similar to campaigns against drunk driving. They said particularly gruesome, emotional and realistic depictions of crashes would get their attention and motivate them to change their behaviors. In addition, clever billboards or rotating LED signs that tell drivers to avoid drowsiness at night could be effective. “In Maryland, signs have promoted the nearest rest stop with a free cup of coffee after certain hours at night,” Beck said in a phone interview. “It may be time to evaluate these and promote them in light of the growing awareness of this problem.” “No one approach will be as effective as many approaches together,” Beck said. “We need to ramp up both publicity and enforcement, and we need to establish a culture for young drivers that drowsy driving is the equivalent of drunk driving.” “Think of the three ‘D’s’ - drunk, drowsy and distracted driving - that are the big causes of auto fatalities in the U.S., and they’re all largely preventable,” he said. In 2007, a Massachusetts driver-licensing program imposed strict penalties for violating a law that prohibited unsupervised driving at night, which included a drowsy driving education program. A 2015 study of the program, published in Health Affairs (bit.ly/2Fn2faJ), found that crash rates fell 19 percent for drivers ages 16-17 and 7 percent for ages 18-19. “We’ve found that legislation targeting the hazards of drowsy driving can reduce the risk of drowsy driving crashes among teen drivers,” said Dr. Charles Czeisler of Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, who worked on the 2015 study. “The most important message is that drowsy driving is dangerous,” he told Reuters Health by email. “Young drivers are at the greatest risk of drowsy driving crashes.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2FpOJDd Sleep Health, online December 1, 2017.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-students-sleepy-driving/college-students-see-drowsy-driving-as-legally-safe-idUSKBN1EZ221,Health News,Reuters,health,638
2020-03-04 00:00:00,2020,3.0,4,Cruise sees rapid improvement in self-drive data in California,"(Reuters) - General Motors Co’s self-driving unit Cruise said its test vehicles experienced a rapid rate of improvement in the second half of 2019, enabling it to edge past Alphabet Inc’s Waymo in data reported to California’s Department of Motor Vehicles. Data released last week by California showed Waymo and Cruise had the greatest number of test miles between “disengagements,” when a human driver must intervene to take control from a self-driving system during testing on public roads. The disengagement data is widely used as a yardstick to compare companies testing self-driving vehicles on California roads, and is often cited as evidence that Waymo leads the sector. Both companies last week criticized the disengagement data. Waymo tweeted that the disengagement metric “does not provide relevant insights” nor does it distinguish Waymo’s “performance from others in the self-driving space.” While the annual data showed that Waymo had the greatest average number of miles between disengagements for the full year, Cruise showed a greater rate of improvement in the second half. Cruise said the data is more useful for showing an individual company’s performance. It said its miles between disengagements in the second half jumped to 20,110, compared with 7,635 in the first half. Cruise, which tests its self-driving vehicles mainly on the streets of San Francisco, noted that it is “intensely focused on rate of improvement.” “Focusing our testing in a dense urban environment has allowed us to improve at a much faster rate than in a simpler suburban setting,” said Cruise spokesman Ray Wert. Waymo did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Waymo also saw its miles between disengagements improve from 11,887 in the first half to 14,819 in the second half. Af the annual California data was released last week, Waymo said that much of its real-world system validation data comes from Phoenix, where the company has been testing self-driving vehicles for several years and operates a small commercial ride sharing fleet. The company’s self-driving performance in Phoenix “is largely unrelated to our California testing,” which Waymo said is mainly for engineering development. “We don’t think (California) disengagement data should be used to compare performance, or judge readiness or competency,” Waymo said.

2019-09-19 00:00:00,2019,9.0,19,Ex-Facebook engineer Patrick Shyu makes fun of company on YouTube,"A former Facebook software engineer named Patrick Shyu took to his YouTube channel this week to post a video called ""Day in the Life of a Facebook Software Engineer."" It's not about any ordinary day, but rather the day Facebook fired him just over a month ago. In the clip, he pretends to walk into a meeting with a human resources representative, who fires him, in part because she didn't like his YouTube channel. Shyu then proceeds to make fun of Facebook and criticize its culture, calling it a ""popularity contest,"" where ideas and projects are driven by likes and comments instead of logic. ""Imagine receiving multiple notifications every day where people are just telling me what they've accomplished, how great they are,"" Shyu said in the video. Shyu, whose ""TechLead"" YouTube channel has over 500,000 subscribers, has been routinely poking Facebook, publishing six videos about getting fired since the day he says he was dismissed, Aug. 26. On that day, he posted a video titled ""I got fired from Facebook (for having a YouTube channel),"" which he shot from his car after apparently leaving the office. He also tweeted out the announcement with a link to the video. ""I know that everybody is shocked,"" he said. ""And at a dire time like this, I feel like what we really need to do is just take a pause, and thank our sponsor."" He then launches into an advertisement. Shyu joined Facebook in May 2018 and previously spent almost four years at Google, according to his LinkedIn profile. While at Google, he worked in the office in San Bruno, California, where YouTube is based. Many of his videos give insights into the life of software developers. They typically get between a few hundred thousand and over 1 million views. In a Sept. 9 video titled, ""How much I make on 1,000,000 YouTube views (after getting fired from Facebook),"" he says that he's probably making well over $500,000 on the site. ""It's funny that I'm generating more on YouTube than what I made as a tech lead at Google or as a staff software engineer at Facebook,"" he said. In the latest video this week, Shyu said Facebook employees have to constantly boast about their mundane accomplishments on Workplace, the company's internal social network, in order to get ahead. ""It's kind of this game for people to get as many likes and comments on their posts,"" he said. ""If you're into popularity contests, if you thrive in that type of environment then you'll probably do really well."" Facebook's culture was described as ""cult-like"" by former employees who spoke with CNBC in January for a report about the company's performance review system.

The development is a setback for Elliott’s private equity arm, Evergreen Coast Capital Partners, as it seeks to become a credible buyer of public companies. Elliott has participated in buyouts of smaller private companies such as Dell’s software group but it is best known as an activist shareholder. Gigamon rejected Elliott’s latest offer in the past few weeks after it came in below the company’s share price, one of the sources said. Gigamon shares ended trading on Thursday at $43.55, giving the company a market capitalization of $1.6 billion. Negotiations could resume in the future with Elliott, or Gigamon could receive an offer from another party, the sources said. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Elliott and Gigamon declined to comment. Santa Clara, California-based Gigamon makes software used in large data centers to boost the flow of traffic and prevent bottlenecks. Elliott is one of Gigamon’s largest shareholders, having disclosed a 15.3 percent stake in the company in May. Gigamon shares have risen about 24 percent since then. Founded by billionaire Paul Singer, Elliott is known for pushing many technology companies to sell themselves in recent years, including Mentor Graphics, LifeLock Inc and Qlik Technologies. But it has branched into private equity investing through its Evergreen unit, which was set up in 2015 and announced its first deal last year. A leveraged buyout of Gigamon would mark the first takeover of a public company to be led by Elliott. Elliott’s Evergreen participated in the auction for LifeLock, but the company was ultimately sold to Symantec Corp for $2.3 billion. Reporting by Liana B.

2017-11-21 11:27:57,2017,11.0,21,F.C.C. Plans Net Neutrality Repeal in a Victory for Telecoms,"The Federal Communications Commission released a plan on Tuesday to dismantle landmark regulations that ensure equal access to the internet, clearing the way for internet service companies to charge users more to see certain content and to curb access to some websites. The proposal, made by the F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, is a sweeping repeal of rules put in place by the Obama administration. The rules prohibit high-speed internet service providers, or I.S.P.s, from stopping or slowing down the delivery of websites. They also prevent the companies from charging customers extra fees for high-quality streaming and other services. The announcement set off a fight over free speech and the control of the internet, pitting telecom titans like AT&T and Verizon against internet giants like Google and Amazon. The internet companies warned that rolling back the rules could make the telecom companies powerful gatekeepers to information and entertainment. The telecom companies say that the existing rules prevent them from offering customers a wider selection of services at higher and lower price points. “Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,” Mr. Pai said in a statement. “Instead, the F.C.C. would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that’s best for them.” Mr. Pai, a Republican who has pursued an aggressive deregulation agenda, was widely expected to have his plan approved during a meeting on Dec. 14. The two other Republicans on the commission generally vote with Mr. Pai, giving them a majority over the two Democrats. Telecom and internet companies are expected to lobby hard in Washington — and directly to the public — as they did when the current rules were adopted. Some internet companies were expected to put up a fight to prevent the proposal from taking hold. The Internet Association, an industry group, joined a legal effort in 2015 to protect the existing rules. The agency has already received 20 million public comments, many of them in opposition of changing the rules, since Mr. Pai announced the broad outlines of his thinking early this year. The big companies that provide internet access to phones and computers have fought for years against broadband regulations. Under the new plan, broadband providers will be able to block access, slow down or speed up service for its business partners in some cases — as long as they notify customers. “This action will return broadband in the U.S. to a regulatory regime that emphasizes private investment and innovation over lumbering government intervention,” said Joan Marsh, a vice president at AT&T. Big online companies like Google and Facebook say the repeal proposal would allow telecom companies to play favorites by charging customers for accessing some sites or by slowing speeds to others. The existing rules were written to prevent such arrangements, adopting a policy often called net neutrality. “We are disappointed that the proposal announced today by the F.C.C. fails to maintain the strong net neutrality protections that will ensure the internet remains open for everyone,” Erin Egan, a vice president at Facebook, said in a statement. “We will work with all stakeholders committed to this principle.” Small online companies believe the proposal would hurt innovation, because telecom companies could force them to pay more for the faster connections. Only the largest companies, they say, would be able to afford the expense of making sure their sites received preferred treatment. Companies like Etsy and Pinterest, for example, credit their start to the promise of free and open access on the internet. And consumers, the online companies say, may see their costs go up if, for example, they want high-quality access to popular websites like Netflix, a company that depends on fast connections for its streaming videos. Netflix said on Tuesday that it opposed Mr. Pai’s proposal. The action “represents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans,” said Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, a lobbying group that represents Google, Facebook, Amazon and other tech companies. Mr. Pai said the current rules had been adopted to stop only theoretical harm. He said the rules limit consumer choice because telecom companies cannot offer different tiers of service, for example. As a result, he said, internet service companies cannot experiment with new business models that could help them compete with online businesses like Netflix, Google and Facebook. “It’s depressed investment in building and expanding broadband networks and deterred innovation,” Mr. Pai said Tuesday. Comcast, one of the country’s biggest broadband companies, said it would not slow websites that contain legally permitted material. “We do not and will not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content — and we will be transparent with our customers about these policies,” the company said. In a call with reporters, F.C.C. officials said the blocking and slowing of some content could be seen as anticompetitive. Those practices, they said, would be policed by the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department. The plan to repeal the existing rules, passed in 2015, would reverse a hallmark decision by the agency to consider broadband a public utility, as essential as phones and electricity. The earlier decision created the legal foundation for the current rules and underscored the importance of high-speed internet service. It was put in place by Tom Wheeler, an F.C.C. chairman under President Obama. Mr. Pai, who was appointed chairman by President Trump in January, has eliminated numerous regulations during his first year. The agency has stripped down rules governing television broadcasters, newspapers and telecom companies that were meant to protect the public interest. On Tuesday, in addition to the net neutrality rollback, Mr. Pai announced a plan to eliminate a rule limiting any corporation from controlling broadcasts that can reach more than 39 percent of American homes. The fight over net neutrality could end up being one of his biggest and most fraught decisions. For more than a decade, the agency has struggled with how to regulate internet service, leading to extended legal battles. The rules adopted under Mr. Wheeler were upheld in 2016 by a federal appeals court in Washington. The proposal released on Tuesday will probably make its way to court as well. And companies like Google and Facebook are expected to push the public to speak out against the plan. They coordinated a huge online protest against the possible changes in July. Some of the lobbying could take place in Congress, even though it may change little because Republicans control both houses. Nevertheless, Democrats have vowed to try to reconstruct the strict rules adopted by the F.C.C. in 2015. The next three weeks promise to hold intense lobbying from both sides, but that might not be the end of it. The regulation of internet providers has already swung once on a change in the Oval Office. “As good as the F.C.C.’s action is for I.S.P.s, it only assures nonregulation of broadband through 2020,” said Paul Gallant, an analyst at the research firm Cowen.

2016-05-06 12:00:00,2016,5.0,6,The Subreddit Dedicated to Trolling Makeup Vloggers Will Make You Blush,"Far off in a hidden part of Reddit, a conversation about lipstick is about to turn ugly.  The commenters have noticeably girly names, like ""PrincessBatman,"" ""BaroquePrincess,"" ""KittenBeauty"" and (ahem) ""MindVagina."" Above them is a banner decorated with a mildly deranged collage, like something a teenage goth would blu-tack inside her school locker. It features Minions, Urban Decay ""Naked"" eyeshadow palettes, and a picture of Ellen Pao with devil horns. The signature Reddit alien is there too, floating in the corner, its usually blank face accessorised with lipstick and a pair of severely arched eyebrows.  Reddit's /r/muacirclejerk is a community built on two values: a love of beauty products, and a dedication to relentless trolling. The result reads like Lord of the Flies, if it was set in a Sephora.  Its members seize on hyperbolic advertising claims and try-hard YouTube ""beauty gurus,"" and mock the obsessions of beauty communities within Reddit itself, like /r/SkincareAddiction and /r/PaleMUA. They alight on the materialistic and the machiavellian, the flippant brand loyalties and the all-consuming narcissism of beauty guru culture, all while remaining a part of this community themselves. It's a weird, occasionally hilarious place, and an insight into the mind of the girl troll at her most self-aware.  In order to ""get"" /r/muacirclejerk's humour, you must already be steeped in online beauty culture. You will keep up with blogs, forums and Instagram accounts, and likely have spent hundreds of hours watching YouTube tutorials. Though this will help you understand the references to ""Dip Dip"" (cult product Anastasia Dipbrow Pomade) and ""boyfie-built battlestations"" (a dressing table, often assembled with the help of a boyfriend), it will more importantly help you to appreciate the truth at the heart of /r/muacirclejerk: that the online beauty community has become a joke itself.  Up until recently, social media served as a grassroots counterpart to mainstream beauty media, where writers were often obliged to give positive reviews to brands in order to please advertisers. Now social media has usurped its place at the top, with ""beauty gurus"" among the most heavily-sponsored and brand-affiliated contributors to YouTube (so much that the site recently launched a ""school"" for beauty vloggers). In this landscape, /r/muacirclejerk operates as the online beauty underground. Like its close relative, Guru Gossip, it relies on a thorough grounding in the same scene it aims to critique. However, /r/muacirclejerk concerns itself less with public figures than with the behavioural quirks of their fans.  The result is a distinctly Reddit, right down to its name. ""MUA"" stands for MakeupAddiction, the most well-known beauty subreddit, as well as ""makeup artist"" (the irony here being that most members of MUA communities are not professionals, though they might act—and spend money on makeup—as though they think they are). Meanwhile ""circlejerk"", implying exactly what you think it does, refers to the long-running Reddit community dedicated to calling Reddit's own users out.  Dip Dip in its natural environment, the beauty vlog. This makes for a curious mix of girly subject matter and trolling. Posts combine camp humour with an eye for ludicrous self-parody—many of members are also a part in the same communities they criticise. They address the delusional claims made by makeup brands for their products, and the dismal results when they fail. (Infamous makeup brand Lime Crime's best-known lipstick, ""Cashmere"", is referred to constantly as ""Cashmere butthole"" for the puckered, shrivelling effect it can cause on the lips.)  ""I got the idea for it during one of those sort of 'bitchfest' threads on MUA (/r/makeupaddiction) where everyone whines about what other people post,"" said moderator ZEF666, speaking in Reddit messages about the origins of /r/muacirclejerk. ""We all clearly took ourselves a little too seriously, and were all posting about the same dumb trends over and over (back then it was all about 'zOMG WINGED LINER' and 'WASH YR BRUSHES OR YOU'LL DIE!!!')"".  Unlike sites like GOMI dedicated to bitching about public figures, /r/muacirclejerk aimed to provide an outlet specifically for makeup fans to make fun of themselves. Founded in 2014, the subreddit hit its first thousand subscribers within two months, then five thousand in four months. Membership currently stands at over 15k.  ""It got a small amount of subscribers when I first linked to it, then it sort of blew up whenever there was drama.,"" ZEF666 wrote. ""There were a few notoriously butthurt people who hated that their posts got parodied. They posted about it in MUA and everyone learned about it.""  /r/muacirclejerk's memes can easily baffle outsiders, as they usually refer to the highly particular, frequently fleeting obsessions of mainstream online beauty communities.  These include the panic over parabens as ingredients, the ""constructive criticism"" of selfies, and the obsessive application of sunscreen. (Skin colour is a point of contention within beauty subreddits, with users frequently belying an underhanded racism with their obsession with ""pale princess"" skin, as well as a curious persecution complex around highlighting products being too dark.)  There are protracted references to Mean Girls and Revlon's ""Black Cherry"" lipstick (an apparently ""universally flattering"" purple shade which leaves many a wearer looking like the undead). Most often you'll see references to ""Dip Dip"" (""Dip dip is key, brows are life...""), to the point that upvotes are called ""updips"" instead.  They also have a keen eye for excess, and cynical marketing. Posts parody meme culture and the very lucrative business of fandom, and challenge the assumption that female internet users demand the use of trigger warnings (users are, to all appearances, proudly untriggerable). The phrase ""literally Hitler"" is frequently used to describe anything bad.  ""People seem to go through stages of liking the gurus and blogs,"" said ZEF666, who did not give their real name. ""Then they slowly realise that half of them are paid to shill some shitty product. Then they get cynical and wise up, and start being a more 'conscious consumer.' MUACJ is definitely an outlet for those in the cynical stage.""  At first, reading /r/muacirclejerk left me baffled, and occasionally a little grossed out. But I started to find it funny, and came back, I started to agree with their points. I stopped believing what beauty gurus told me, and started questioning their brow game. Perhaps this is what it means to be a conscious consumer.  Finally, I questioned my own biases relating to Reddit: Is it such an overwhelmingly ""male"" place after all? Their openly girly, troll-y tone struck me as contradictory at first. But who's to say men do most of the internet's trolling?  What's also unexpectedly clear with /r/muacirclejerk is that their community is a labour of love. For the products, the community they so militantly police, for themselves and for their selfies. You come for the Dip Dip, and stay for the self-reflexive humour.  Recently, a new story has shown up on the subreddit: In an act of sublime poetry, the makeup brand MAC have announced that they're producing a collection themed around ""Trolls"". They mean the neon-haired, crinkly-faced toys we remember from childhood, but it didn't take long for online beauty's troll queens to get in on the joke.

The initiative will be funded from the current 1 trillion-euro EU budget, which runs from 2014 to 2020. Towns will have to apply to get the funds. The three EU institutions - the council of EU governments, the parliament and the European Commission - decided that funds for the free WiFi initiative will come from a limited review of the seven-year EU budget. Monday’s political compromise will need to be followed by a technical agreement over how the EU budget’s resources should be used to fund the new project. The EU budget cannot be increased, but funds can be partly shifted. New resources could also come from fines to companies or other one-off revenues.

2019-05-09 00:00:00,2019,5.0,9,"It's #FreeThePill day, a day of activism to make birth control available without prescription"," (CNN)Nearly 60 years after the Food and Drug Administration approved the birth control pill, women and health activists across America are campaigning to make the oral contraceptive truly accessible to all. Using #FreeThePill, people took to social platforms including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to call on the government to make the pill available over the counter, without the need for a prescription. ""#FreeThePill because a) women shouldn't be subjected to outdated, patronising, clinically unnecessary consultations to access their repro rights b) they shouldn't have to go on a wild goose chase to find it at a reasonable price & c) because you can buy viagra over the counter..."" Twitter user, Rebecca Blaylock said.   ""There are a lot of extra costs that come with getting a prescription for birth control including a doctor's visit, missing work and transportation. We could #FreeThePill and make it available over the counter,"" tweeted  Steph Synoracki, who works at Ibis Reproductive Health, the international non-profit that initiated the day of activism. The organization chose May 9 to coincide with the 59th anniversary of the day the FDA  approved the an oral contraceptive as being safe to use.  Although the pill is widely available, the United States is among some 20 countries that require a prescription in order to get a monthly supply of the pill. The brand and how frequently you can get it depends on what type of insurance you have and how much you're willing to pay.  Pharmacies will often give you a generic version of the drug but charge more for a specific brand, which in turn, may cause a variety of side effects. Add to that the doctor's visits that are required to maintain your prescription plus an annual cervical smear - and the time and costs add up.  ""Young people face a lot of barriers to getting the health care they need and getting contraceptives over the counter is one way to tackle that,""  says Rebecca Thimmesch from the sexual health non-profit,  Advocates for Youth. ""It also allows for a confidentiality and allows young people to have agency and autonomy over their reproductive health."" The movement has wide support from organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians, but the politics are messy. The Trump administration wants to overturn the Affordable Health Act - a law that requires insurance plans to provide contraception free of charge. Nearly two-thirds of US women use contraception, CDC reports It also comes amid a national conversation over women's rights as several states propose laws that would virtually ban abortion. Just last week, Georgia approved a bill that would ban abortions if a fetal heartbeat can be detected -- a law that the American Civil Liberties Union says it will challenge in court. ""Although unplanned pregnancies are on the decline in the Unites States, they are still higher here than in other developed countries,"" says sex education expert Lucinda Holt, adding that access to the pill over the counter would help push those numbers down further.

2018-01-12 00:00:00,2018,1.0,12,"After a clot, shorter treatment with compression stockings may be OK","(Reuters Health) - - Even though many patients with blood clots in their veins are told to wear compression stockings for two years to prevent complications like pain and swelling, a new study suggests they may get the same results in half the time. All of the patients in the study wore compression stockings for six months to treat what’s known as deep vein thrombosis, which is when clots develop in a major vein, usually in the lower leg or thigh. Patients often develop what’s known as post-thrombotic syndrome, a constellation of symptoms that include pain, swelling, sores and skin damage. After that initial six months of treatment, researchers randomly assigned 428 people to wear compression stockings for a total of two years, the current standard of care. Another 437 patients could stop wearing stockings sooner, often within just six months, based on doctors’ assessments of their risk of complications. Overall, 28 percent of the people assigned to wear compression stockings for two years developed post-thrombotic syndrome, as did 29 percent of the patients in the group that could halt treatment sooner. This difference was too small to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance. “It is possible to restrict compression to only six months on an individualized basis in those that do not experience complications,” said lead study author Dr. Arina J. ten Cate-Hoek of Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands. “This is positive for patients because this means that only those who need compression for longer duration will prolong therapy,” ten Cate-Hoek said by email. “For the others, shorter duration of therapy means less hassles and less restrictions in their daily living.” Overall, two-thirds of the people in the individualized therapy group stopped wearing compression stockings before two years. About 55 percent of them stopped after six months, and another 11 percent stopped after one year. By the end of the study, 125 people in the individualized therapy group developed post-thrombotic syndrome, as did 118 people in the standard two-year treatment group. A total of 24 patients died, including 17 on individualized therapy, but none of the fatalities were treatment-related, researchers report in The Lancet Hematology. The study wasn’t designed to test whether compression stockings might work better than other interventions, and it’s not clear why more patients died in the individualized therapy group, the authors note. Once patients develop post-thrombotic syndrome, however, treatment options are scarce, said Dr. Dinanda Kolbach, a researcher at Huidcentrum Limburg in Maastricht who wasn’t involved in the study. “Preventive therapy with elastic compression stockings has been the cornerstone of treatment for decades,” Kolbach said by email. “However, the optimum duration of treatment after the acute phase (beyond the first six months) of deep vein thrombosis was uncertain.” The study results suggest that most patients can wear these for less than two years without an increased risk of complications, said Dr. Menno Huisman, a researcher at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands. “This is very important for patients, because wearing compression stockings - which is unpractical, cumbersome and expensive - can be restricted to around 40 percent of patients needing this prolonged therapy,” Huisman, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “For the other 60 percent a shorter duration means less restrictions.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2mmDRNy The Lancet Hematology, online December 4, 2017.

A real, actual blue whale heart, the first one in the entire world to be preserved, now on display at the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) in Toronto. The blue whale heart is installed at the ROM on Thursday. Video: ROM It was unveiled on Thursday morning, next to the skeleton of the massive blue whale it came from. The plastinated heart, which is roughly the size of a small pony, is ""a thing of beauty,"" said Jacqueline Miller, a mammalogy technician from the ROM who's been working with the whale since it was first discovered in 2014, washed up on a beach in Trout River, along Newfoundland and Labrador's west coast. ""It's quite a bit smaller than we were expecting,"" Miller said. She and others thought they'd pull out something the size of a sedan, or at least the smart car that the museum put on display for size comparison. Without its blood and supporting structure, the heart weighs around 400 pounds, but Miller explained that the weight increased again when their team put steel mesh inside to keeps the ventricles and the thinner blood vessels from collapsing. The Epic Task of Preparing Rare Blue Whale Skeletons for Display: The unveiling today wasn't just a quick ta-da moment. The heart came in a box. It had to be unwrapped (so much bubble wrap) and lifted onto a platform. Things hit a bit of a snag when it came to lifting the heart off of the stand inside the box: Miller, who was narrating the unboxing, said that there was some concern over damaging it, but in the end the heart was placed on its new platform without getting a scratch, while people ""oooohed"" and ""aaaaahed"" over the size of the thing. The whale heart represents the maximum size a heart can be and support a living, breathing creature, said Miller. ""This is as big as things can get."" Before going on display in Toronto, the heart travelled from Canada to Germany, where technicians at Geuben Plastinate GmbH, a museum, worked on it for over a year. Because of the size, no one knew exactly how long the plastination process would take. Miller said the heart had to travel to Germany because there is no facility in North America big enough to handle a whale heart. The organ is just too damn big. Read More: We Watched Gigantic Blue Whale Bones Get 'Degreased' First, scientists had to get all the water out of the tissue, down to cellular level. They did this by placing the heart in an acetone bath, said Miller. Next, they had to put it in a polymer bath. After that, scientists put the whole tank of polymer in a vacuum chamber so that the existing acetone would bubble and boil away. ""Fat is very hard to plastinate,"" said Miller. The heart was in this vacuum for over four months. Now that the process is over, Miller affectionately calls it ""Frankenheart"" and compared the unveiling to the birth of a child because she's been working on it for so long. The heart. Video: ROM ""It really is tremendous,"" she said. ""We're very, very proud."" The heart will last hundreds of years, if not a thousand, said Miller.

The two screenings and panels planned for “Tales of the Loop” and “Upload,” in addition to a consumer marketing activation, have been canceled amid concerns over the spread of coronavirus. So far, 11 cases of the respiratory illness have been confirmed in Texas, where SXSW takes place every year. The move follows Facebook and Twitter’s recent decisions to withdraw their participation from the annual music, technology and entertainment festival in Austin, which runs from March 13 to March 22. It is not yet clear whether activities associated with non-studio divisions of Amazon have been canceled as well. A screening of the first two episodes of “Upload” had been set for the afternoon of March 14 at the Stateside Theatre. Following the showing of science fiction comedy from “The Office’s” Greg Daniels, certain cast and crew members were slated to participate in a Q&A. “Tales of the Loop,” a Nathaniel Halpern science fiction drama based on the artwork of Swedish artist Simon Stalenhag, was set to screen at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema South Lamar the night of March 16, followed by a Q&A with the cast and crew. The Amazon Prime Video marketing activation had been planned in partnership with Entertainment Weekly. The outlet sent out a note Tuesday night, citing “health concerns” as the reason for its cancellation. The fear of the ongoing epidemic, which is believed to have originated in Wuhan, China, has slowly begun to spread through Hollywood, prompting studios and networks to pull out of events and restrict nonessential travel. CBS’ “The Amazing Race” suspended production of Season 33 of the unscripted competition series out of an abundance of caution, after having filmed the first three episodes in England and Scotland; no one associated with the show had been affected by the virus. Meanwhile, as Variety exclusively learned, the upcoming season of “The Bachelorette,” featuring newly unveiled star Clare Crawley, has canceled plans to film in Italy, where the outbreak has also taken hold.",https://www.reuters.com/article/variety/amazon-studios-cancels-sxsw-plans-due-to-coronavirus-concerns-idUSL4N2AX428,Healthcare,Reuters,health,343

2017-09-18 00:00:00,2017,9.0,18,Sprint follows AT&T with free iPhone 8 offer for trade-in,"(Reuters) - Sprint Corp said on Monday it will offer Apple Inc’s new iPhone 8 for free with a qualifying phone trade-in, following AT&T Inc’s buy one, get one free promotion on Friday for DirecTV and U-verse TV customers. While carriers have traditionally used phone launches to lure customers and gain market share, last year’s free phone deals were easily copied by rivals and resulted in no competitive advantage, analysts say. In a market where subscriber defections have been low as people hold on to their phones for longer, carriers initially introduced deals with less generous discounts on the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, in a move analysts said would help margins. Both new and existing customers who enroll in the Sprint Flex leasing program will get a free 64GB iPhone 8 if they trade in newer iPhone and Samsung models, Sprint said on Monday. AT&T’s video customers could buy a new iPhone 8 or 8 Plus, add a line and receive a $699 credit for a second device beginning with pre-orders on Friday. Sprint had previously said last Wednesday that customers who trade in an iPhone 6 or select Android devices can save 50 percent off the monthly lease payment of the iPhone 8 or 8 Plus. The iPhone 8 model starts at $699, while the iPhone X will start at $999, Apple announced last Tuesday. Carriers have been restrained on promotions for the new iPhones, and instead are using their strengths to drive differentiation, said Barclays analysts in a note on Monday. AT&T looks to recover subscriber growth through free HBO and cheap DirecTV Now promotions, while Sprint is focused on keeping subscriber losses low, Barclays said. Barclays analysts characterized the initial promotions - including AT&T’s buy one, get one free deal - as largely in line with expectations, but said the carriers could ramp up promotions heading into the holidays, according to a note to clients on Monday. Verizon Communications Inc, the No. 1 wireless carrier in the U.S., declined to comment on plans for additional promotions. T-Mobile US Inc did not respond to requests for comment.

2018-06-20 00:00:00,2018,6.0,20,"China-based hacking breached satellite, defense companies: Symantec","A sophisticated hacking campaign launched from computers in China burrowed deeply into satellite operators, defense contractors and telecommunications companies in the United States and southeast Asia, security researchers at Symantec Corp said on Tuesday. Symantec said the effort appeared to be driven by national espionage goals, such as the interception of military and civilian communications. Such interception capabilities are rare but not unheard of, and the researchers could not say what communications, if any, were taken. More disturbingly in this case, the hackers infected computers that controlled the satellites, so that they could have changed the positions of the orbiting devices and disrupted data traffic, Symantec said. ""Disruption to satellites could leave civilian as well as military installations subject to huge (real world) disruptions,"" said Vikram Thakur, technical director at Symantec. ""We are extremely dependent on their functionality."" Satellites are critical to phone and some internet links as well as mapping and positioning data. Symantec, based in Mountain View, California, described its findings to Reuters exclusively ahead of a planned public release. It said the hackers had been removed from infected systems. Symantec said it has already shared technical information about the hack with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security, along with public defense agencies in Asia and other security companies. The FBI did not respond to a request for comment. Thakur said Symantec detected the misuse of common software tools at client sites in January, leading to the campaign's discovery at unnamed targets. He attributed the effort to a group that Symantec calls Thrip, which may be called different names by other companies. Thrip was active from 2013 on and then vanished from the radar for about a year until the last campaign started a year ago. In that period, it developed new tools and began using more widely available administrative and criminal programs, Thakur said. Other security analysts have also recently tied sophisticated attacks to Chinese groups that had been out of sight for awhile, and there could be overlap. FireEye in March said that a group it called Temp.Periscope reappeared last summer and went after defense companies and shippers. FireEye had no immediate comment on the new episode. It was unclear how Thrip gained entry to the latest systems. In the past, it depended on trick emails that had infected attachments or led recipients to malicious links. This time, it did not infect most user computers, instead moving among servers, making detection harder. Following its customary stance, Symantec did not directly blame the Chinese government for the hack. It said the hackers launched their campaign from three computers on the mainland. In theory, those machines could have been compromised by someone elsewhere. Symantec provides the most widely used paid security software for consumers and an array of higher-end software and services for companies and public agencies.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/19/china-based-hacking-breached-satellite-defense-companies-symantec.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,474

But cryptocurrencies have lost their luster and the company with the hottest stock is now feeling the pinch.  AMD stock plunged 20% in premarket trading after the chip maker announced third quarter earnings that fell short of Wall Street's expectations. It warned of a weaker outlook.  The company said that slowing sales were ""caused by the decline in blockchain-related demand"" for its graphics processors. The blockchain sector as a whole has been significantly cooling because of volatility in cryptocurrency markets.  AMD's (AMD) powerful graphic processors have been instrumental for running crypto's backend technology and its chips seemed preferable to the ones produced by rivals Intel and Nvidia.   Revenue from blockchain was ""negligible"" in third quarter compared to the same period in 2017, AMD's CFO Devinder Kumar said on an earnings call.  AMD expects revenue to fall below analyst's expectations next quarter, too, he said.  Nvidia (NVDA) shares were down nearly 10% in premarket trading and Intel (INTC) was down nearly 5%.  It wasn't all bad news at AMD. Its third quarter revenue jumped by 4% compared with a year ago to $1.65 billion, but fell below Wall Street expectations for $1.7 billion.  AMD has dropped 30% since it hit a 12-year-high in September. But it's stock is still up a whopping 121% for the year.

2016-11-11 00:00:00,2016,11.0,11,"50 years on, what has changed since the first modern mass shooting?"," (CNN)By now, it's a tragically familiar storyline.  An angry, armed white man unleashes a hailstorm of bullets on a group of random innocents, leaving behind carnage, shattered families and questions about how it could have been prevented.  Before Elliot Rodger, Adam Lanza and Columbine, before the customary procession of speeches, vigils, hashtags, rallies and calls for reform, there was Charles Whitman, the University of Texas Tower sniper who killed 17 people and wounded 30 in 1966. A new documentary now in select theaters across the United States, ""Tower"" revisits the shooting 50 years and a few months after the actual August 1 anniversary -- the same day the state's campus carry law took effect (which lawmakers say was a coincidence). Still, depending on your view, it's hard to overlook the irony or the symbolism. The Texas Tower shooting wasn't just the first mass school shooting, it was the first mass shooting of the modern era: random, public, unpredictable and ""therefore, impossible to defend against,"" said ""Tower"" director and UT graduate Keith Maitland. ""At the time, no one involved had any context for this kind of attack,"" Maitland said. The United States has a long history of mass shootings, notes author Louis Klarevas, including the 1903 Winfield, Kansas, massacre that left nine dead and the 1949 Camden, New Jersey, murder spree that left 13 dead. The UT Tower attack was the first mass shooting broadcast into the living rooms of American families through radio and television. As such, ""it allowed Americans to experience mass murder in an unprecedented, quasi-direct manner,"" said Klarevas, author of ""Rampage Nation: Securing America from Mass Shootings.""  Since the UT Tower attack, mass shootings have been on the rise, both in terms of frequency and lethality. In fact, 2016 is on record as the deadliest year to date for mass shootings because of the Orlando nightclub attack, which itself is the deadliest shooting in American history. And, yet, overall rates of crime are declining. To explain the dichotomy, experts have a few theories that underscore how much has changed since 1966, even as some things remain the same. More people = more shooters = more shootings The reason mass shootings are occurring with greater frequency can be partly explained by our growing population, Klarevas said.  ""Quite simply, more potential shooters, more rampage shootings."" And, people have access to high-powered weapons with large-capacity magazines that deliver fatal force without interruption, resulting in higher death tolls than before, he added. ""Quite simply, more bullets, more victims."" Blame the Internet Even if the Texas Tower attack was the first mass shooting of its kind, it's a stretch to say it started a trend. It would take another 30 years for mass shootings to start becoming as frequent as they are now. According to a report from the Congressional Research Service, there was an average of one incident per year during the 1970s, in which an average of 5.5 victims were murdered and two were wounded per incident.  That number rose to nearly three incidents per year during the 1980s (6.1 victims murdered, 5.3 wounded per incident); four incidents per year during the 1990s (5.6 victims murdered, 5.5 wounded per incident); four incidents per year during the 2000s (6.4 victims murdered, 4 wounded per incident); and four incidents per year from 2010 through 2013 (7.4 victims murdered, 6.3 wounded per incident). What changed during that time? We got the Internet, for one thing, posits psychologist Frank T. McAndrew, a professor at Knox College in Illinois. More often than not, shooters tend to be young men on the margins who feel like ""disrespected losers"" compared with the successful, attractive winners all over the Internet and social media, McAndrew said. ""The Internet makes it easier for us to feel like losers. We're always comparing ourselves to others and obsessing over what we lack,"" he said. The same platform is a direct path to fame that attention-seekers can use to make a statement, he said. ""You know if you do it, you'll be in the news; you'll be a person of consequence."" ... and fame-seeking Research shows that fame is also a compelling incentive. ""As a culture, America's priority on fame-seeking at any cost and celebrity culture is much worse than it used to be,"" said criminology professor Adam Lankford of the University of Alabama, author of ""The Myth of Martyrdom."" For those obsessed with making it, mass violence can be a means to an end.  In a February journal analysis of mass shooters' statements, Lankford makes the case that fame-seeking rampage shooters are more common in recent decades, more so in the United States than in other countries. Decades of data show that on average, children born in the United States in recent years have ""loftier expectations"" of personal success, including fame and fortune, than previous generations, Lankford wrote in ""Fame-seeking rampage shooters: Initial findings and empirical predictions.""  ""When you have more people over time who want to be famous and this particular type of crime is the only way to guarantee you'll be famous -- unless you have exceptional skills or exceptional luck -- that creates a deadly combination."" Though Adam Lanza and one other shooter have named Whitman as inspiration for their crimes, according to Lankford's research, the killers most commonly cited as inspiration are Columbine High School shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. Signs of progress The fame-seeking copycat theories are compelling, given that not much else has changed in terms of causes of gun violence. Whitman is believed to have suffered from mental illness, just like many of today's mass shooters.  Otherwise, it's impossible to say what could have prevented the Tower shooting, but it's clear that law enforcement today are better prepared for these scenarios. They have advanced communication systems instead of hand-held radios, tactical training and weaponry -- lots of it, too much for some people, Maitland believes. Other changes since Whitman's time give Maitland hope. The one thing he heard over and over in dozens of interviews with witnesses and survivors was how they wished they had someone to talk to after the shooting. ""I think that's a big change in the last 50 years. After mass shootings these days, there are grief counselors and all kinds of opportunities for individuals to approach their experience and work through the trauma via counseling and treatment. ""It's incredibly difficult to process this kind of trauma. But I think that's a definite sign of progress,"" he said. ""I wish there were more.""

2019-05-30 00:00:00,2019,5.0,30,'Merch by Amazon' t-shirt business increasing orders from Disney to Dr. Seuss,"NEW YORK/MADRID (Reuters) - The holy grail for apparel brands facing rising uncertainty and cost in their global supply chains is to make their merchandise closer to the point of the sale.  Entertainment companies from Walt Disney Co to Dr. Seuss are increasingly turning to Amazon.com Inc’s t-shirt printing service to help it get there. The trend is up-ending the traditional licensing model where brands worked with apparel wholesalers to produce garments and get them into stores.  The ‘Merch by Amazon’ on-demand printing service, in its third full year of operation, works by printing t-shirts once an order comes in, meaning content creators like video game makers and pay TV channels do not have to commit to a large merchandise inventory upfront.  This allows companies to offer t-shirts featuring niche characters that would not warrant a wide distribution.  “You can list overnight on Amazon all the merchandise that’s for sale and then as you book sales you just make it and ship it,” said intellectual property lawyer Gaston Kroub. “It completely cuts out that whole traditional supply chain.”  The expanding service is another way in which Amazon is becoming a major player in the clothing industry. The company had a group of patents granted in recent years outlining a process to integrate fabric printing, cutting, sewing and dispatch to a customer in one computer-controlled process.   Bringing apparel manufacture back to the United States and Europe would eliminate the long production times and commitment to big orders inherent for Western apparel brands sourcing from countries like China, Vietnam and Indonesia.  When fabric cutting is delayed to the last possible moment and garments are produced on-demand, it can also prevent the pile-up of unsold inventory, allowing brands to sell more stock at full price.  Amazon told Reuters the ‘Merch by Amazon’ format allowed it to offer designs across 21 colors and 15 sizes without brands and content creators having to manage inventory.  It said it was interested in all brand types from major entertainment brands to musicians, consumer products and social media influencers with a minimum of 100,000 followers.  Following an upheaval of consumer habits, which has led to the shuttering of thousands of small apparel stores, Amazon has overtaken Walmart Inc as the most-shopped clothing retailer in the United States and outpaced Marks and Spencer Group PLC in Britain, according to surveys.  Amazon has a try-before-you-buy service as well as many of its own private label clothing brands.  Royalty revenue from sales of licensed merchandise and services globally amounted to $14.5 billion last year, up 2.6% from 2017, according to professional licensing association LIMA, with more than half of that coming from the U.S. and Canada.  Entertainment and character licensing was the biggest industry category, while apparel, toys and fashion was the biggest product category, a LIMA survey found.  Dr. Seuss Enterprises has increased sales through ‘Merch by Amazon’ by 40 percent since opening its store on the site around 18 months ago, selling t-shirts and hoodies emblazoned with characters like The Grinch and The Cat the Hat, president Susan Brandt told Reuters.  Dr. Seuss helps Amazon with design, but Amazon sources the clothing and handles the sales and distribution, a Dr. Seuss Enterprises spokeswoman said. Dr. Seuss also sells licensed products through stores like Target Corp and Walmart, she said.  Disney, which started printing t-shirts on-demand through Amazon in December 2016, has increased orders and expanded offerings from all its franchises since then, including Disney, Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel, a company spokeswoman said.  Disney also uses traditional licensing models to manufacture and sell products, the spokeswoman said.  Pay TV channel Cartoon Network, which started working with ‘Merch by Amazon’ in 2016, has added designs and increased profits via the service since then, a company spokeswoman said.  The brand prints with other vendors, but the on-demand service allows it to give frequent design updates and offer secondary characters that may not be available in traditional stores, she said.  “The profit-sharing on-demand model existed before Amazon started their effort, but the size that they are, they have created a tidal wave,” said Gabi Seligsohn, former CEO and current board member of Kornit Digital Ltd, the Israeli company that provides textile printers for ‘Merch by Amazon’.  The business is growing. Environmental authorities in Philadelphia have approved an expansion at Amazon’s Pennsylvania printing facility, allowing nearly 50% more printers, the Philadelphia Department of Environment told Reuters.  Amazon also runs a second printing facility in Dallas, which was also recently granted preliminary permission to install more printers, a spokeswoman for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality said.  Beyond the United States, Amazon has launched a ‘Merch by Amazon’ printing facility in Poland in mid-2018 that serves the British and German markets.  Amazon said it had not made any announcements regarding expansion.  Showing further interest in on-demand apparel manufacture, Amazon has been actively seeking patents in the space. Intellectual property lawyers say this shows where companies think the technology is going.  “There is no doubt that patenting activity is indicative of some kind of market trend,” said John Lanza, Boston-based intellectual property lawyer at Foley & Lardner LLP. “On-demand apparel manufacture is very hot.”  In 2017, Amazon Technologies was granted a U.S. patent for on-demand apparel manufacturing whereby a textile printer, textile cutter and computing device are linked up to cut out garment patterns and align them for sewing in response to electronic orders.  Amazon Technologies has been granted other patents linked to on-demand apparel manufacture since then, including continuous feed fabric cutting using lasers and a robotic system that uses fluorescent ink as a guide for cutting fabric.  Amazon, a prolific patent generator and one of the United States’ top patent holders, declined to say whether it had put any of the patents into production. Amazon said it filed a number of forward-looking patent applications to explore new technologies and said they did not necessarily reflect current developments to products and services.  “The trend for things becoming on-demand is only going to grow,” said Lanza.

2017-07-20 00:00:00,2017,7.0,20,"Living healthily, learning more could cut dementia cases by a third","LONDON (Reuters) - Learning new things, eating and drinking well, not smoking and limiting hearing loss and loneliness could prevent a third of dementia cases, health experts said on Thursday. In a wide-ranging analysis of the risk factors behind dementia, the researchers highlighted nine as particularly important. These included staying in education beyond age 15, reducing high blood pressure, obesity and hearing loss in mid-life, and reducing smoking, depression, physical inactivity, social isolation and diabetes in later life. If all these risk factors were fully eliminated, the experts said, one in three cases of dementia worldwide could be prevented. “Although dementia is diagnosed in later life, the brain changes usually begin to develop years before,” said Gill Livingston, a professor at University College London and one of 24 international experts commissioned by The Lancet medical journal to conduct the analysis. “A broader approach to prevention of dementia which reflects these changing risk factors will benefit our aging societies and help to prevent the rising number of dementia cases.” Latest estimates from the Alzheimer’s Association International show there are around 47 million people living with dementia globally and the cost of the brain-wasting diseases already $818 billion a year. Dementia is caused by brain diseases, most commonly Alzheimer’s disease, which result in the loss of brain cells and affect memory, thinking, behavior, navigational and spatial abilities and the ability to perform everyday activities. The number of people affected is set to almost triple to 131 million by 2050, according to the World Health Organization. The researchers found that among the 35 percent of all dementia cases that could be prevented, the three most important risk factors to target were increasing early life education, reducing mid-life hearing loss, and stopping smoking. Not completing secondary education while young can make people less resilient to cognitive decline when they get older, the experts said, while preserving hearing helps people experience a richer and more stimulating environment, building cognitive reserve. Stopping smoking reduces exposure to neurotoxins and improves heart health which, in turn, affects brain health, they said.

2019-11-22 00:00:00,2019,11.0,22,Pakistan grapples with drug-resistant typhoid outbreak,"KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Early this year Muhammad Haider Sajjad, a thin bespectacled boy of 15, was hospitalized in Karachi, Pakistan’s commercial capital. Doctors suspected typhoid, but when the most common antibiotics failed to work, the boy’s family began to panic. Sajjad is one of more than 11,000 people, mostly children, to have contracted a drug-resistant strain of the infection in the country since 2016, and which experts say risks spreading internationally. He survived, but hundreds have died, predominantly in the southern province of Sindh. In response Pakistan’s government, already battling outbreaks of polio and dengue, has launched a huge foreign-funded vaccination drive that began on Nov 15. Some 3.4 million children have been vaccinated in the last four days in Karachi and the neighboring city of Hyderabad where the outbreak was first reported, said James Fulker, a spokesman for GAVI, a Geneva-based partnership funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that is administering the vaccine. Kept out of school for three months, Sajjad passed the time by tallying the daily rounds of shots given during his treatment - 84 in all. “I had not much to do during my illness. I used to keep count of injections I was being given,” he said. The latest strain is resistant to all but one antibiotic used to treat typhoid, a bacterial infection transmitted by human faeces. If it develops resistance to this final antibiotic treatment, disease experts say, death rates among those infected could rise dramatically to as much as 20%. Sanitation is a major issue in Pakistan, especially in Karachi, a sprawling port city of more than 15 million on the Arabian Sea. Here, political infighting between two regional parties over refuse collection has seen huge mounds of garbage pile up in the street. Reuters visited several areas where the vaccine was being administered, predominantly in low income areas with poor quality, illegal housing. “Typhoid is a nightmare in countries like Pakistan because the hygienic situation is not good,” said Muhammad Khalid Shafi, a pediatrician and associate professor at Dow Medical College in Karachi. Resistance to immunization programs has hampered attempts to stamp out other diseases. In July, officials working on polio prevention told Reuters that parents suspicious of mass immunization campaigns have been getting hold of special markers, used by health workers to put a colored spot on the little fingers of children who have been vaccinated. They said in some areas, as many as 8% of families may be refusing or avoiding vaccination, a level which would mean the disease is not eradicated. In several areas of Karachi, local mosques make announcements urging parents to get their children vaccinated against typhoid, especially in low-income neighborhoods. The costs of refusing vaccination can be steep. The only antibiotic treatment to the latest strain of typhoid is expensive. Sajjad’s father, Syed Ahmed Jafer, estimates the cost of his treatment at 400,000 Pakistani rupees ($2,584) - a huge sum for almost any family in the country. “People should not be afraid of this campaign,” he said. “There is no cheap treatment, it cannot be ignored.” ($1 = 154.8000 Pakistani rupees) Reporting by Syed Raza Hassan in Karachi, writing by Alasdair Pal; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-vaccine/pakistan-grapples-with-drug-resistant-typhoid-outbreak-idUSKBN1XW143,Health News,Reuters,health,534

The cases range from the grey Alter Ego Titanium which you can get for $1,460, and stretch right through to the pearlescent Alter Ego Aurora which retails for $2,768 — almost double the price of the most expensive 512GB iPhone XS Max. Although Gray advertises that the case “turns your phone into an object of mystery and power,” in more practical terms the case has an X-shaped design that straps on to the rear of the device, and mainly protects the phone’s four corners with its titanium construction. For an extra $36, Gray will even engrave your name into the case, which will one day serve to memorialize your questionable life choices. The iPhone protector even comes with an accessory all its own: a fancy box that you can use to exhibit the Alter Ego when it’s not in use. Sadly the box is “only” made out of aluminum, says its maker, although it’s apparently “aerospace grade” if you’re into that sort of thing.

2019-02-13 00:00:00,2019,2.0,13,DJI will toughen up airport geofencing after recent drone disruption,"A three-dimensional “bow tie” geofence will soon prevent DJI’s drones from being able to fly too close to major European airports. While the company’s drones have included geofencing technology since 2013, the new tech — developed by aviation tech company Altitude Angel — expands the restricted zone from a simple two-dimensional circle to a much larger three-dimensional zone. The announcement comes after drone sightings caused Gatwick, the UK’s second-largest airport, to shut down in the run-up to Christmas, grounding hundreds of flights. Although a local couple was arrested by police, they were later released without charge. As a result, we still don’t know who was responsible or what brand of drone was used. Both Gatwick and Heathrow airports have also purchased their own anti-drone systems in the wake of the disruption. DJI’s new system, which it’s dubbed Geospatial Environment Online (GEO) 2.0, uses three different sizes of exclusion zone, depending on the size of the airport. Along with restricting flights in an oval around the runway itself, the geofence also includes an “Altitude Zone” at both ends of the airport. This last zone is three-dimensional, meaning you can still fly a drone at lower altitudes once you’re far enough away from the runway. Along with the United Kingdom, DJI says the update will be coming to 32 European countries in total, including 19 countries that previously had no geofencing support at all. The GEO 2.0 update will be available starting later this month, and it will require users to update the firmware on their drone as well as the companion DJI Go 4 mobile app.  ",https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/13/18223184/dji-geofencing-airport-gatwick-disruption,Tech,The Verge,technology,265

The world’s best-known advertising boss is building up the new venture following his departure from ad giant WPP, sealing deals for digital content that runs on platforms like Facebook and Google, and the automated placing of ads online. Sorrell said digital growth was “on fire” and his focus on it meant he was currently involved in five large pitches. S4 will gain access to Firewood’s client base in the United States, including Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Salesforce and VMware. S4 raised 100 million pounds ($123 million) through a placing to part fund the Firewood deal and to build up a war chest for future acquisitions. Rather than replicate WPP, the world’s biggest advertising company he created with a holding company model, Sorrell is buying smaller agencies and merging them into one arm producing content and one arm handling the programmatic placing of ads. “I don’t want to end up with a fragmented model,” he said. Sorrell told Reuters he is still looking to acquire companies that own first-party data on consumer habits, but said he had two small deals looming for data analytics companies, with one in London and one in Korea. “They will slot in to the programmatic offer,” he said. S4 has already won work from the likes of Procter & Gamble, Nestle, Coca-Cola and Sprint and had said it was being asked to bid for other major clients. Industry data released on Monday showed the U.S. advertising market remained solid, helped by small- and medium-sized companies spending on digital platforms to reach customers.

2017-03-25 13:00:00,2017,3.0,25,The Brunch Industrial Complex Is Ruining Yelp,"Walk into any Brooklyn or San Francisco restaurant before sunset, and you're likely to be handed a ""Brunch Menu."" While lots of ink has been spilled over whether or not ""brunch culture"" is another example of overblown, millennials-driven trends, it's hard to dismiss its takeover of metropolitan food scenes in the past decade or so. I call it: the Brunch Industrial Complex. That's right,  Big Brunch is out to get us, one Bloody Mary at a time, and the first victim of its aggressive expansion is Yelp. You'll go to the site to check out some pictures of entrées at a new spot you want to try for dinner, but you're met with a wall of brunch plates: French toast, omelets, and other fine foods that I'm sure are delicious but that tell me little about what a restaurant has to offer for dinner or lunch. Yelp said it couldn't provide me with hard data of how dominant brunch pictures are on its site, but during my recent online survey of 40 Brooklyn restaurants in the span of two weeks—which all offer brunch as well as breakfast and dinner services—I found an overwhelming portion of the small business' Yelp pages flooded with brunch photography. On average, about a third of each page (at least) was dominated by eggs, French toast, Benedicts and so on. Even for a seasoned diner like myself, I found the lack of representation of other meals (or even cocktails) offered disturbing...considering the list included a wine tasting room and several coffee shops. Here's a list of Brooklyn restaurants and the number of brunch pics each one has on Yelp's first page of images (number represents photos out of 30 per page):  Traditionally, there are three meals in the day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And now a new, in-between meal culturally constructed by coastal elites—brunch—is taking up a third of Yelp's image real estate? This is a problem.  Williamsburg's Delaware and Hudson is a prime example of this issue's effect, chef and owner Patti Jackson told me by phone. Jackson's brunch menu features prominently on Yelp, with the restaurant's images page currently flooded with 12 brunch-like dishes, like the crab cake with poached eggs. In short, if I hadn't happen to have eaten at the restaurant myself in the past, I wouldn't necessarily know they offer a large range of dinner options by looking at Yelp.  When I asked Jackson how this lopsidedness has affected the business, she explained that while it's boosted the brunch rush, it hasn't necessarily promoted Delaware and Hudson's lauded dinner options.  ""A lot of aspects of Yelp are frustrating for most businesses due to its unorganized nature,"" Jackson said. ""It would be great for them to find a way showcase more meals."" And Jackson isn't the only business owner who feels this way.  ""It's a tricky situation, because we want the Yelp reviews obviously, given that we're at four stars and want to keep that up,"" Daron Pearce, general manager at Brooklyn's Le Barricou, told me by phone.   Le Barricou has been categorized mainly as a brunch establishment online, ""which has pigeonholed us over the years,"" he continued. ""This also leads to issues like people coming in for pancakes and Bloody Marys at night, which we can't accommodate.""  This isn't just annoying to the staff, but it also affects the restaurant's bottom line. ""Our brunch already stretches the limit of what we can do. We can't push our hours and resources more than we already do,"" Pearce said.  Brunch's explosive popularity in the age of Instagram rides on the daytime meal's appeal on digital platforms, which begs the question: why exactly are brunch photos taking over the image section of services like Foursquare and Yelp?  ""One thing with brunch's popularity in general is that its food items are cognizant to the average diner,"" food writer Pelin Keskin, who covers brunch culture for Eater, told me by email. The reason for this is that usually customers know what something will taste like since brunch options tend to be more formulaic, Keskin said. Not to mention brunch is a lot cheaper than a dinner menu. ""People take pictures of things that will appeal to most of their followers and get them the most likes, but this isn't usually the case with Yelp,"" Keskin explained. ""With brunch, diners tend to go out with friends, either in large groups or another person, so they're comfortable snapping photos around them.""  Then there's the fact that in the daytime, the lighting is good and the orders are colourful, which makes table spreads more appealing.  ""A lot of it is about lighting. When you've got good light, a runny egg, and some sort of avocado situation—you kind of have to take a photo and post it,"" Rachel Karten, who manages Bon Appétit's social media feed and constantly analyses what makes for great food photography on social, told me by email. ""At least more than you ~have~ to post a candle-lit pork chop sitting on top of some unrecognizable mashed vegetable. It just isn't asking for it in the same way, and frankly won't get as many likes.""  ""The very thing that restaurants try and sell in terms of ambience, like candlelit dinners is what's making it harder to showcase their complete work [dinner and lunch services] online,"" Keskin said. ""I've seen some restaurants push for brunch menus because they know it's profitable.""   In other words: brunch is eating lunch's...lunch. While Yelp hasn't done anything specific to address this issue on the backend, Keskin believes there are things the company can do to help out small business owners.  Although Yelp's service relies on user-uploaded images, there are ways to organize a restaurant's photos in order to promote more than just its daytime menu, thus further perpetuating the Brunch Industrial Complex.  ""I'd say they have to vet pictures being uploaded, which they already do to ensure no one is uploading anything explicit,"" Keskin advised. ""But another thing they could do is separately categorized galleries for each meal, such as breakfast, brunch, dinner, drinks, etc."" According to Yelp, the order in which photos appear on a restaurant's business page is determined by different factors, ""including votes from the community and how recently the photo was taken,"" Yelp spokesperson Brenae Leary told me by email. ""Our Photo Understanding team works to identify high quality photos contributed by users to help give the best representation of a restaurant's offerings."" At the end of the day, with so many options available to diners in cities across the country, there is no reason why platforms can't step up and address representation—especially when it's affecting both patrons and business owners. Pearce agreed, saying the current categorizations are frustrating. ""Having 50 pictures of the same brunch item definitely isn't helpful,"" he said. ""Sectioning foods would help expose more types of dishes that we're known for, than just brunch that we do."" As Keskin said, Yelpers probably want other users to know what is being served at their favorite places, so they'd be more inclined to take pictures of dinner and other non-brunch options to upload them for fellow Yelpers, if they're encouraged to by the platform. I hope Yelp takes this advice. It's the only way to take down Big Brunch.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z49yzw/the-brunch-industrial-complex-is-ruining-yelp,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,1213
2016-05-29 00:00:00,2016,5.0,29,"French finance minister rules out Google tax deal, more firms could be targeted","PARIS (Reuters) - France will ‘go all the way’ to ensure that multinationals operating on its soil pay their taxes and more cases could follow after Google and McDonald’s were targeted by tax raids, Finance Minister Michel Sapin said. Sapin, speaking in an interview with Reuters and three European newspapers, ruled out negotiating any deal with Google on back taxes, as Britain did in January. Dozens of French police raided Google’s Paris headquarters on Tuesday, escalating an investigation on suspicions of tax evasion. Investigators searched McDonald’s French headquarters on May 18 in another tax probe. “We’ll go all the way. There could be other cases,” Sapin said. Raids this month by police and justice investigators build on the work started by tax authorities three or four years ago, when they transferred tax data to judicial authorities that look into any possible criminal angle, Sapin said. Google, McDonald’s and other multinational firms such as Starbucks are under increasing pressure in Europe from public opinion and governments angry at the way businesses exploit their presence around the world to minimize the tax they pay. Google says it is fully complying with French law and McDonald’s declined to comment on the search, referring back to past comments that it is proud to be one of the biggest tax payers in France. Sapin said he could not discuss what sums were at stake because of the confidentiality of tax matters. A source in his ministry had said in February that French tax authorities were seeking some 1.6 billion euros ($1.78 billion) in back taxes from Google. Asked if tax authorities could strike a deal with the tech giant, he said: “We don’t do deals like Britain, we apply the law.” Google agreed in January to pay 130 million pounds ($190 million) in back taxes to Britain, prompting criticism from opposition lawmakers and campaigners that the sum was too low. “There won’t be negotiations,” Sapin said, adding that there was always the possibility of some marginal adjustments “but that’s not the logic we’re in.” Google, now part of Alphabet Inc, pays little tax in most European countries because it reports almost all sales in Ireland. This is possible thanks to a loophole in international tax law but it hinges on staff in Dublin concluding all sales contracts. This week’s police raid is part of a separate judicial investigation into aggravated tax fraud and the organized laundering of the proceeds of tax fraud. Should it be found guilty of that, Google faces either up to 10 million euros ($11 million) in fines or a fine of half of the value of the laundered amount involved. A preliminary inquiry into McDonald’s was opened early this year after former investigating magistrate and politician Eva Joly filed a lawsuit in December on behalf of an employee committee, a judicial source said. French business magazine L’Expansion reported last month that authorities had sent McDonald’s France a 300 million euro bill for unpaid taxes on profits believed to have been funneled through Luxembourg and Switzerland. It said tax officials had accused the giant U.S. burger chain of using a Luxembourg-based entity, McD Europe Franchising, to shift profits to lower-tax jurisdictions by billing the French division excessively for use of the company brand and other services. The judicial source confirmed the investigation was looking into this. The government said this week that it had raked in 3.3 billion euros in back taxes and penalties from just five multinationals in 2015. “Nothing prevents big groups from coming to us and declaring their taxes,” Sapin said.

2018-03-19 17:41:00,2018,3.0,19,Why We're Not Calling the Cambridge Analytica Story a 'Data Breach',"On Saturday, an investigation by The New York Times, the Guardian, and its sister publication The Observer revealed that the data analytics firm that helped the Donald Trump presidential campaign had harvested the Facebook data of more than 50 million people in an effort to profile users and eventually target them with political ads. In 2014, a researcher collected the data through an app that asked users to take a personality test for academic research purposes. Around 270,000 people agreed to have their data collected through the test, which its creator, Aleksandr Kogan, defined as “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.” But thanks to Facebook’s terms of service and its API at the time, the app was also able to collect data of their friends. This gave the researcher, who later handed the data to Cambridge Analytica, the raw information of more than 50 million people, according to the reports, which were largely based on the account of a former Cambridge Analytica data scientist. The Observer called it one of Facebook’s “biggest ever data breaches.” The Times only referred to the incident as a “breach” once, using the term “leak” throughout the rest of the article. We at Motherboard believe the use of the expression “data breach” in this case is incorrect and may be confusing to readers. As the news spread and echoed online, several websites and other publications called it a data breach. Many security experts and researchers—and Facebook itself—believe this is the wrong expression to refer to what happened here. “It is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term,” Facebook’s chief security officer Alex Stamos wrote in a deleted tweet. Facebook’s vice president and deputy general counsel Paul Grewal wrote that “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false,” because the researcher who made the app obtained the data from “users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent.” Saying that “everyone involved” consented seems misleading, given that only around 270,000 out of the 50 million people who got their data harvested reportedly signed up for the app. The others probably had no idea this app even existed. And since Facebook changes its privacy settings so frequently, we also don't know if the people who agreed to use the app fully understood what kind of data they were giving up. And no one at the time knew the data would later be handed out to a shadowy data analytics firm hired by the Trump campaign. While we understand why some are describing the data Kogan handed to Cambridge Analytica as a breach, based on what’s been reported so far, we believe that describing this incident as a breach would, at least at the moment, mislead our readers. We’ve been regularly covering data breaches for years. No one hacked into Facebook’s servers exploiting a bug, like hackers did when they stole the personal data of more than 140 million people from Equifax. No one tricked Facebook users into giving away their passwords and then stole their data, like Russian hackers did when they broke into the email accounts of John Podesta and others through phishing emails. In 2014, when Kogan collected the data of 50 million people, he was playing by the rules. At the time, Facebook allowed third party apps to collect not only the data of the people who consented to giving it up, but also their friends’ data. The company later shut down this functionality. Facebook says the data was misused because Kogan told Facebook he would use it only for academic research. But that might be the only anomalous thing about this case. Facebook obviously doesn't want the public to think it suffered a massive security breach, like Yahoo did in 2013 and 2014. We agree not because we want to minimize the significance of the Cambridge Analytica story, but because the real story is far more troubling: This data collection was par for the course. In other words, it was a feature, not a bug. And while the process that Kogan exploited is no longer allowed, Facebook still collects—and then sells—massive amounts of data on its users. As Zeynep Tufekci, the author of Twitter And Tear Gas, put it, Facebook’s vehement defense that this was not a data breach is itself actually a damning statement of what’s wrong with Facebook, and Silicon Valley’s ad industry in general. “If your business is building a massive surveillance machinery, the data will eventually be used & misused,” Tufekci, a University of North Carolina professor who studies the social impact of technology, wrote on Twitter. “There is no informed consent because it's not possible to reasonably inform or consent.” Facebook’s security team, Tufekci concluded, can’t mitigate the company’s business model, which is predicated on collecting as much of our data, and our friend’s data, as possible. We can condemn the misuse of this data, and Facebook’s data collection practices, without calling it a data breach, a term that may confuse readers and distract them from what we believe is the real problem here: Silicon Valley giants have built massive data collection machines with almost no guardrails on how they are used.

2019-05-17 00:00:00,2019,5.0,17,"Grumpy Cat is dead, but will live on through AI","San Francisco (CNN Business)Grumpy Cat — the angry-looking celebrity feline who launched countless internet memes — died on Tuesday. The beloved cat leaves behind her owner Tabatha Bundesen, a small empire of books and merchandise bearing her unique face, movie and TV appearances, and millions of Google hits.  Grumpy Cat is also likely to live on in one particular area of technology: artificial intelligence. Images spread across the internet are often collected by researchers and used to train artificial intelligence algorithms to do tasks like recognize people or animals in images, or even learn how to generate wholly new images of people or animals.   There are millions of images of Grumpy Cat online, so it should come as no surprise that they appear to be influencing the faux cats generated by at least one AI system. The cat could show up in datasets containing images from the internet — and in results that emerge from these datasets — shaping AI in a grouchy way for years to come. Grumpy Cat, whose real name was Tardar Sauce, had feline dwarfism; she became Internet famous in September 2012, when her owner's brother posted images of her on Reddit. People on the platform immediately reacted by posting countless Photoshopped variations of the original. The photo's Imgur page reached 1,030,000 views in its first 48 hours, and a video of the cat posted on YouTube quickly snagged millions of views. These days, searching Google for ""Grumpy Cat"" returns nearly 73 million results, many of which are photos. Grumpy Cat proliferated online, often as memes posted with big, blocky white text that say everything from ""Come back ... I haven't finished insulting you yet"" to simply ""No."" There are also countless pictures on the internet of Grumpy-Cat inspired merchandise: pillows, shirts, mugs, slippers and more. Janelle Shane, a research scientist working on a book that uses humor to explain AI, also noticed recently that an AI system came up with numerous artificial cats that looked an awful lot like Grumpy Cat.  The AI system, called StyleGAN, was developed by researchers at computer-chip maker Nvidia and released earlier this year. While it initially focused on using a set of Creative-Commons-licensed images of people from Flickr to create faux faces, the researchers also used an existing dataset of cat images — part of a larger dataset of various images collected by Princeton Researchers from the internet — to see what kinds of cats StyleGAN could make. Shane spent time poring over thousands of the results, and she told CNN Business that she was surprised she didn't have to look through many to find images suspiciously similar to the iconic cat. In a couple thousand images, for example, she found at least two dozen. ""We're not talking wall-to-wall Grumpy Cat, but you don't have to look very long,"" she told CNN Business. Some of the manufactured Grumpy Cats even included what looked like garbled meme text: the right kind of font (white with a black outline), but in what didn't look quite like real words. Shane didn't go through all the images in the dataset to confirm Grumpy Cat is in there, and if so how often, but she expects there are plenty of images of the famous cat included. (Researchers who put together the dataset did not immediately return requests for comment.) And while it's unknown just how many images of Grumpy Cat are in AI datasets — or out on the internet at large, for that matter —  Shane expects Grumpy Cat will be in plenty of them, given the cat's popularity and the propensity for AI researchers to share and reuse datasets.  ""A little part of her could be in AI for years and years,"" she said. ",https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/17/tech/grumpy-cat-dead-ai/index.html,tech,CNN,technology,622

2017-10-18 00:00:00,2017,10.0,18,U.S. judge says he may reject plea deal with Novelion's Aegerion,"BOSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday said he may reject a plea agreement that was part of Aegerion Pharmaceuticals Inc’s recent $36 million settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, saying he was not happy with its sentencing terms. U.S. District Judge William Young at a court hearing in Boston held off on definitively not accepting the deal, in which the Novelion Therapeutics Inc unit would plead guilty to two misdemeanors related to its marketing of an expensive cholesterol drug. But he said his “instinct is to reject it.” Young noted he had in prior cases criticized plea agreements that made the parties’ sentencing recommendations binding on the court. However, he said he would take further briefing on why he should accept the plea deal. “I’ll carefully review it and inform you whether I accept it or not,” Young said. The judge’s comments marked an unexpected complication for Aegerion to finalize a settlement with the Justice Department announced Sept. 22 aimed at resolving a long-running investigation centered on its cholesterol drug Juxtapid. Prosecutors said that after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2012 approved Juxtapid for treating high cholesterol in people with a rare genetic disease, Aegerion promoted it for patients who did not have the condition. As part of a deal with the Justice Department, Aegerion agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor drug misbranding violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and pay $36 million to resolve criminal and civil claims. It also entered into a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve a charge that it conspired to violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The settlements finalized agreements Aegerion disclosed in May 2016. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company in November 2016 merged with QLT Inc and became a subsidiary of the newly named Novelion. Aegerion said in a statement that Young’s comments were “consistent with his previously stated views that he will only accept binding corporate plea agreements where there are ‘special reasons’ to do so.” He had previously in 2012 and 2013 rejected similar corporate plea deals in cases against Orthofix Inc and APTx Vehicle Systems Ltd, saying the deals were “insufficiently protective of the public interest.” At Wednesday’s hearing, Young cited those cases in saying it was not his practice to accept plea deals with binding sentencing recommendations. He set a trial date for April 30, which he said would give the “parties time to continue their negotiations and review their positions.” The case is U.S. v. Aegerion Pharmaceuticals Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 17-cr-10288.

2017-10-26 11:01:00,2017,10.0,26,'Wolfenstein II' Shows Us That Nazis Were an American Problem All Along,"Video games and first person shooters in particular have always reveled in the act of murdering Nazis. They're great cannon fodder because there's no moral ambiguity to them. They're just genocidal, iconically evil comic book villains. The real crimes against humanity they committed make them foreign to us, Other—so unlike us in their evil ways they are barely human—which perhaps explains the subgenre of Nazi-zombie video games. It is easy to kill what you don't understand.  Of all the Nazi-shooting video games, none is more iconic than the  Wolfenstein series. Id Software's 1992  Wolfenstein  3D largely defined the first person shooter (before that team moved on to make  Doom), forever tying the genre to the act of murdering Nazis. In many ways,  Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is just another  Wolfenstein game (there have been 11 in total but this one is a direct sequel to the 2014 reboot of the series), a big budget game publisher returning to the well because video games is a risky business and a known quantity is a safer bet.  But the world has changed a lot since the last time a  Wolfenstein game came out, and so  Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus finds itself under a brighter spotlight. It has stumbled onto the third rail of American politics, and just so happens to carry a message that its audience needs to hear: that those Nazis we've been shooting for decades are not that alien after all.  The first worrying sign is that a video game about Nazis taking over America seems relevant to what's happening in the news at all. In August, white supremacists marched down the streets of Charlottesville, VA with lit tiki torches chanting ""Jews will not replace us."" After being met with opposition in the streets by anti-fascist protestors, and after a white supremacist drove into a crowd and killed one of the anti-Nazi protesters with his car, the president of the United States said that ""both sides"" shared responsibility for the violence. Earlier this month, Bethesda put out a new ad bearing the slogan ""Make America Nazi-Free Again,"" a riff on Donald Trump's campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again."" Last week, Bethesda put out a new ad in support of punching Nazis. The debate about whether one should punch Nazis or not started after Richard Spencer, who helped organize that white supremacist march in Charlottesville, was sucker punched during Trump's inauguration.  Worse yet is that some gamers are openly objecting to Bethesda's ad campaign and the violence towards Nazis in  Wolfenstein II in general because they think it's racist to white people.  Developing a big budget shooter like  Wolfenstein II takes years, and as Bethesda's head of public relations Pete Hines told me in an email, there was no way the company could have predicted our current political climate. That hasn't stopped it from leaning into the moment.   ""We've used some of the President's phrasing because they are unfortunately illustrative of the game world echoing real world events,"" Hines said. ""We have actual Nazis marching openly on the streets of The United States of America in 2017. Just think about how crazy that sounds."" But is it really that crazy?  Wolfenstein II, surprisingly, makes a compelling case that it is not. This is evident from the opening moments of the game, which delve into meathead protagonist B.J. Blazkowicz's past. As a child in early 20th century Texas, we learn, Blazkowicz was raised by a Jewish immigrant mother and a racist, white American father.  We know he is racist because he punishes Blazkowicz when he learns he's been getting too friendly with an African American girl, who he calls the n-word two times only 10 minutes into the game. It is very jarring, but maybe what's necessary to paint a picture of this man, who blames his failed business on his wife's Jewishness, his son palling around with people of a different race—everyone but himself.  From the very beginning,  Wolfenstein II is telling players they might not like it, but the racism they are fighting against is also literally part of their character.  This also sets the stage for later, when  Wolfenstein II implies that the Third Reich was able to take over America in part because its ideals already aligned with those of many Americans. (For more on the real history of what the Third Reich learned from America's codified racism in the 1930s, this  Atlantic article about James Q. Whitman's book  Hitler's American Model is a good place to start).  Blazkowicz didn't take after his father. Rather, he grew up to be a Nazi killing machine and, after the events of the previous game, a symbol of hope for those who dare oppose Nazi world domination. But his past is not forgotten. In  Wolfenstein II, When Blazkowicz asks for help from Grace Walker, an African American leader of an American insurgency against the Nazis modeled after the real Black Panther Party, she doesn't hold back. She tells him that white America isn't fighting the Nazis like she is. That when they took over, they let the Ku Klax Klan govern the South. ""Monsters did this,"" Blazkowicz tells Grace in her hideout at the top of a delipidated Empire State Building, overlooking a New York City destroyed by a nuclear bomb, discussing what Nazis have done to America.  ""Not monsters. Men,"" she corrects him.  Men like Blazkowicz's father. Men like those who marched with torches in Charlottesville. That's what's truly scary about Nazis: They're not just video game villains like aliens or zombies. They're something we can become when we're not paying attention. It is something that is already in our society.  It is also worth saying that, yes, in every other way  Wolfenstein II is exactly what I expected it to be. It is a grotesquely over-the-top shooter where I blew up Nazis' skulls, melted them with lasers, and chopped their legs off with an axe before putting that axe in their face while maintaining eye contact. I'm going to leave it to the experts to argue about whether this is healthy or not, but it felt good. It felt really, really good. There has never been a more cathartic time to play a video game where you mercilessly kill Nazis, and in my opinion there has never been a better  Wolfenstein game, so it works out.  That it also has something pertinent to say about what is happening in the world easily makes it one of the most important games of the year.

2020-01-24 00:00:00,2020,1.0,24,China says it is building hospital over weekend to treat coronavirus,"The Chinese city of Wuhan is rapidly building a new 1,000-bed hospital to treat victims of a new coronavirus, mobilizing machinery to get it ready by early next week, state media said. The virus has killed 25 people in China and infected more than 800, the government said on Friday, as the World Health Organisation declared it an emergency but stopped short of declaring the epidemic of international concern. Most of the cases are in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated late last year. The new hospital is being built around a holiday complex originally intended for local workers, set in gardens by a lake on the outskirts of the city, the official Changjiang Daily reported on Friday. Prefabricated buildings which will have 1,000 beds will be put up, it said. Building machinery, including 35 diggers and 10 bulldozers, arrived at the site on Thursday night, with the aim to get the new facility ready by Monday, the paper added. ""The construction of this project is to solve the shortage of existing medical resources"" the report said. ""Because it will be prefabricated buildings, it will not only be built fast but it also won't cost much."" The hospital aims to copy the experience of Beijing in 2003, when the city battled Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). As many as 774 people died in the SARS epidemic, which reached nearly 30 countries. At the time, Beijing built the Xiaotangshan hospital in its northern suburbs in just a week.

2016-02-08 14:25:00,2016,2.0,8,"Wolves Have Different ‘Howling Dialects,' Machine Learning Finds","Differentiating wolf howls with human ears can prove tricky, so researchers have turned to computer algorithms to suss out if different wolf species howl differently. They think that understanding wolf howls could help improve wolf conservation and management programs. In a study published in the journal Behavioural Processes, a group of international researchers describe using machine learning for the first time to analyse 2,000 wolf howls gathered from both wild and domesticated wolves and their subspecies from around the world. ""Rather than looking at these howls and saying, 'This one sounds like that and this,' we wanted to remove that kind of subjective analysis."" Arik Kershenbaum, a research fellow at the University of Cambridge's Department of Zoology and lead author of the study, told me over the phone. ""So we used some mathematical techniques—firstly to characterize the howls, then to give them an accurate and objective mathematical representation."" The machine learning techniques helped the researchers whittle down the 2,000 sound recordings into 21 types of howl based on pitch and fluctuation, which they dubbed 'howling dialects.' They then used mathematical models to find out which patterns of howling different species used. ""What we found was a consistent difference in the way that animals used the different types of howl,"" said Kershenbaum. ""Arctic northern wolves (C. I. arctos) use very long low howls while many of the smaller animals tend to yap a lot more and use up-and-down howls."" Wolves continue to clash with farmers who think they pose a threat to their livestock. But according to Kershenbaum, traditional methods of keeping them at bay—using fencing, shooting them down, or playing back howls of other wolves—do not work. Currently, the researchers have a project in Yellowstone National Park in the US, where they are using triangulation technology to detect and record howl locations and sounds. In the future, the researchers hope that they will be able to locate where certain species are based on their howls, and tailor conservation methods accordingly. But they admit that studying wolves in the wild is difficult given their elusive nature. Kershenbaum cited the example of comparing the howls of endangered red wolves to coyotes (Canis latrans) with which they have a tendency to breed and hybridise. Kershenbaum explained that as the two have similar styles of howling, pinpointing the subtle differences might help conservationists keep these two species apart in the future. ""We're looking to monitor wolves remotely by using howls,"" said Kershenbaum. ""If we could understand the difference between a territorial howl and a feeding or hunting howl, then that may enable us to produce more effective barriers to conflict and keep wolves away from human territories in a non-lethal way.""",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z43ney/wolves-have-different-howling-dialects-machine-learning-finds,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,447

The investigation followed a report by Reveal on Sunday alleging that Tesla under-counted and mis-labeled employee injuries at its electric vehicle factory in Fremont, California, as well as a paint shop fire that occurred there in early April. Tesla has disputed the report by Reveal and characterized the fire as ""small."" ""Cal/OSHA takes seriously reports of workplace hazards and allegations of employers' underreporting recordable work-related injuries and illnesses,"" the agency said in a statement. Cal/OSHA's inspections of the Tesla Fremont factory will, among other things, determine whether the electric car company is reporting serious injuries directly to the agency within eight hours, as required by law. Such investigations typically take 3 to 6 months. The agency is likely to conduct multiple on-site visits to Tesla's Fremont factory as part of the probe, but does not provide detailed information on open investigations. Cal/OSHA defines a serious injury or illness as one in which an employee is hospitalized for more than 24 hours or when a part of the body is lost or permanently disfigured. Read CAL/OSHA's statement: Cal/OSHA takes seriously reports of workplace hazards and allegations of employers' underreporting recordable work-related injuries and illnesses on the Log 300.

2017-03-19 19:06:17,2017,3.0,19,Riding With the Underdogs: Apps Fill a Void Left by Uber and Lyft,"Bits AUSTIN, Tex. — When I arrived in Austin this month for the annual South by Southwest festival, I was prepared to time travel to a harsh past: an era when people had to wave their hands on street corners, begging for curmudgeonly cabdrivers to pull over and offer a ride. This was the picture many expected during the music, film and technology festival because Uber and Lyft, the two most popular car-summoning apps, pulled out of Austin last year after the city voted to tighten regulations on ride-sharing services. With hundreds of thousands of people attending SXSW, this sounded like a recipe for disaster. Yet the reality — for me and many attendees I spoke with — was that getting around Austin during the festival was easy. Several smaller ride-sharing services were operating in town, such as Fasten and RideAustin. Despite some hiccups with those apps, they worked well over all. And, of course, there were taxicabs hovering if you were lucky enough to get one. “Setting up a new account with Fasten or RideAustin took all of a minute,” said Sam Grobart, an executive editor for CNN and a former technology reporter for The New York Times, who attended the conference. “I’m as brand loyal to a ride service as I am to a gas station chain — which is to say not at all.” Many attendees echoed that sentiment, and my experience was the same. During the festival, I heavily relied on car services because my Airbnb house was several miles from the conference. After taking 20 rides divided among Fasten, RideAustin and taxis, only once did I have an issue summoning a car, with Fasten on a rainy Saturday night. That left me to — heaven forbid — open an umbrella and walk a mile to my next meeting. Issues like mine, BuzzFeed proclaimed, meant that apps like Fasten and RideAustin “flunked an important test” during a busy conference in which they could have triumphed over the big apps by maintaining smooth operations. But I saw it differently. If these smaller apps, which have less funding and fewer resources, managed to move hundreds of thousands of people around and choke only occasionally, that meant Austinites probably weren’t suffering without Uber and Lyft in general, especially when the city is not overrun by an enormous conference. Kirill Evdakov, the chief executive of Fasten, which operates in Boston and Austin, said the company had completed 170,000 rides during SXSW, with a failure rate of less than half a percent. The app crashed on a Saturday when demand surged exponentially because it was pouring outside and a competing app’s servers crashed, he said. Still, Mr. Evdakov said last week: “Unfortunately, we let many people down. We are working even harder the rest of this week to regain their satisfaction and we hope that they will forgive us.” The festival ended Sunday. RideAustin did not respond to requests for comment. There is no disputing that Lyft and Uber are superior products. Their apps are more polished and include the option to add multiple drop-off points, for example, and server crashes are rare. Yet they, too, are imperfect: Over my years using both apps, they have occasionally failed to summon a car, drivers have gotten lost and rides have been canceled inexplicably. Uber and Lyft aren’t giving up on Austin. The companies last week attended a hearing with the House Transportation Committee at the Texas State Capitol, where lawmakers discussed legislation that would regulate ride-sharing services at the statewide level. Lyft said it was focused on getting consistent rules passed for all cities in Texas to make ride more affordable and easier to get. Uber said it felt “encouraged” that the Texas Legislature was considering a statewide solution. But until the services return to the city, people probably won’t notice much of a difference riding with the underdogs. At the end of the day, the apps connect riders with drivers, who are imperfect people, leading to imperfect experiences. Caz Rosson, a web designer who spent nine days at SXSW, said the alternative ride-sharing apps were just like Uber and Lyft. “It’s basically just all the same Uber and Lyft drivers working under a different brand name,” she said, adding that the only major difference is that Fasten’s app is green — not pink or black.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/19/technology/personaltech/south-by-southwest-uber-lyft-ride-sharing.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,724

FIS (FIS), a financial technology company that provides software for payment processing and other services mostly to banks, is buying Worldpay (WP), which makes technology that underpins credit card and other transactions for e-commerce merchants. Acquiring Worldpay will help FIS expand its reach in digital payments. Worldpay processes around 40 billion transactions a year. For Worldpay, the deal will help expand into new markets and compete with global payment rivals. The companies are trying to create a ""one-stop shop,"" said Darrin Peller, analyst at Wolfe Research. They believe joining forces will put them in stronger positions to capitalize on the growing e-commerce payments industry and provide improved financial technology solutions to banks and merchants. Global payments are set to reach close $3 trillion within the next five years, projects McKinsey. FIS and Worldpay struck the deal as the payments and processing industries consolidate. FIS' big competitor Fiserv (FISV) recently acquired First Data (FDC), a payments rival to Worldpay. ""Scale matters in our rapidly changing industry,"" FIS CEO Gary Norcross said in the statement. ""As a combined organization, we will bring the most modern solutions targeted at the highest growth markets."" FIS is offering Worldpay shareholders a mix of cash and stock to make the deal happen. It will assume Worldpay's debt as part of the agreement that values the company at $43 billion. FIS shareholders will end up holding 53% of the merged company, while Worldpay shareholders will own the remaining 47%. The deal is expected to close later this year. Shares in Worldpay were up nearly 11% in early trading Monday. ",https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/18/tech/fis-worldpay-deal/index.html,tech,CNN,technology,280
2018-04-04 10:28:49,2018,4.0,4,Facebook Says Cambridge Analytica Harvested Data of Up to 87 Million Users,"WASHINGTON — Facebook on Wednesday said that the data of up to 87 million users may have been improperly shared with a political consulting firm connected to President Trump during the 2016 election — a figure far higher than the estimate of 50 million that had been widely cited since the leak was reported last month. Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, also announced that Facebook would offer all of its users the same tools and controls required under European privacy rules. The European rules, which go into effect next month, give people more control over how companies use their digital data. Facebook had not previously disclosed how many accounts had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, the firm connected to the Trump campaign. It has also been reluctant to disclose how it was used by Russian-backed actors to influence the 2016 presidential election. Among Facebook’s acknowledgments on Wednesday was the disclosure of a vulnerability in its search and account recovery functions that it said could have exposed “most” of its 2 billion users to having their public profile information harvested. The new effort to appear more transparent about the data leaks — including a rare question-and-answer session with Mr. Zuckerberg and reporters — came just before Mr. Zuckerberg’s expected testimony next week on Capitol Hill, where he will most likely face criticism over how the company collects and shares the personal data of its users. Sheryl Sandberg, Mr. Zuckerberg’s top deputy, has several national television interviews scheduled for later this week. The company said that on Monday it would start telling users whether their information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica. Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook in Washington, said the 87 million figure was an estimate of the total number of users whose data could have been acquired by Cambridge Analytica. He said that the estimate was calculated by adding up all the friends of the people who had logged into the Facebook app from which Cambridge Analytica collected profile data. “We wanted to put out the maximum number of people who could have been affected,” Mr. Zuckerberg told reporters. It remains unclear exactly how many users had their personal information accessed by Cambridge Analytica. The firm said Wednesday that it had licensed data for no more than 30 million users of the social network. Facebook also released a lengthy document describing how it would protect personal data in the future. In that document, Facebook said its search and account recovery systems had been open to abuse by anyone who already had some information about an individual, such as a phone number or email address. The vulnerability extended to much of the platform’s user base before it was closed on Wednesday, Facebook said. The company also said it would limit the types of data that can be harvested by software used by outside businesses. The changes mean that users will have to give permission before an app can collect information beyond their names and addresses. The company also said it would no longer allow outsiders to use apps to gather information about the religious or political views of its users. And it will stop using third-party data from companies such as Experian and Acxiom to help supplement its own data for ad targeting. “It’s clear now that we didn’t focus enough on preventing abuse,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “We didn’t take a broad enough view of what our responsibility is. That was a huge mistake, and it was my mistake.” The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Facebook violated a 2011 agreement meant to protect users’ privacy. User data is crucial to the company’s business, because it is used to deliver advertising to users. Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify about the company’s handling of sensitive user data before the Senate’s Commerce and Judiciary committees on Tuesday and the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday. “This hearing will be an important opportunity to shed light on critical consumer data privacy issues,” said Representatives Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, and Frank Pallone, Democrat of New Jersey, of the House committee. Senator Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said, “With all of the data exchanged over Facebook and other platforms, users deserve to know how their information is shared and secured.” Facebook’s problems stretch back before the reports about Cambridge Analytica, to earlier investigations into how Russian actors infiltrated the platform by placing ads and posts to influence the 2016 election. Mr. Zuckerberg initially dismissed the idea of foreign interference on Facebook as a “crazy idea.” Since then, the company has been the focus of investigations by law enforcement and congressional committees that are delving into the Russian influence campaign. Facebook now acknowledges that its platform was used to sway voters. All those troubles have prompted investors to flee the company, and its stock has fallen sharply in recent weeks. In response, the company has put its executives front and center. Mr. Zuckerberg typically talks to groups of reporters only after the company releases its quarterly financial reports. But after not responding in public for several days following the Cambridge Analytica disclosure, he has given a series of interviews. And Ms. Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer and the second most recognizable face at the company, is set to be interviewed this week by Fox News, “PBS NewsHour,” NBC’s “Today” show and Bloomberg. Ms. Sandberg will be interviewed remotely from California. Facebook said its new openness was meant to show that it takes the intense criticism over its handling of user data seriously. In Washington, Facebook employees and public relations firms retained by the company have talked to regulators and congressional staff members about new privacy measures, including updates to policies that are intended to make them easier to understand. On Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg provided a preview of what he will tell Congress next week. He said Facebook was “an idealistic and optimistic company.” But he acknowledged that the company had committed serious errors by not ensuring that robust safeguards were in place for users. Asked if he should still be leading the company, he said, “Yes. Life is about learning from the mistakes and learning what you need to go forward.” Terrell McSweeny, a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission, said that Mr. Zuckerberg has a big task ahead of him in Washington. “I think it is important for Zuckerberg to clearly explain how Facebook plans to earn back consumer trust,” Ms. McSweeny said. “Consumers need reassurance that their data are not being misused.” An earlier version of this article attributed incorrectly an estimate that 50 million Facebook users’ personal information may have been improperly shared during the 2016 election. The estimate was based on documents and former Cambridge Analytica employees and associates. It did not come from Facebook.

2018-10-03 00:00:00,2018,10.0,3,Bumble to expand to India with the help of actress Priyanka Chopra,"New York (CNN Business)Bumble is the latest online dating app to compete for the hearts of women in India. Bumble, which requires women to make the first move, announced Wednesday plans to launch in India later this year. Indian celebrity Priyanka Chopra, a new investor in the company, will advise on the expansion. The news comes less than a week after rival Tinder launched a My Move feature in India that gives women the option to prevent men from initiating a conversation. But Bumble's efforts for an expansion in India have been in the works for awhile. Founder and CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd said the newly engaged Chopra first told her ""Indian women needed Bumble"" months ago. Chopra was among a group of high-profile women who helped Bumble kickoff its networking app, Bumble Bizz, in October 2017. ""It was clear then we shared a passion for empowering young women on a global level,"" Wolfe Herd told CNN in an e-mail. ""From there we began architecting a plan to partner and launch Bumble in India."" Wolfe Herd said the challenge in entering the Indian market is ""localizing the experience and attracting women"" — an area in which Chopra will help. Chopra's manager, Anjula Acharia, is also an investor and adviser. Acharia helped Chopra — who was already established in India — reach fame in the United States. But Acharia has a long history of crossover efforts. She was instrumental in introducing artists such as Britney Spears and Lady Gaga to India — a background that could translate to Acharia helping Bumble resonate with the local audience. Bumble's local app will be in both Hindi and Hinglish — a hybrid between Hindi and English — and available on iOS and Android. It will also roll out new safety features before entering the region, which has a reputation for violence against women. In June, India was named the most dangerous country in the world to be a woman. Wolfe Herd said it will only require Indian women to provide the first initial of their name — no first or last names — and provide new ways to report ""bad behavior"" in the app. Bumble already has photo verification features and more than 4,000 content moderators who review photos and profiles. Before Bumble, Wolfe Herd was an early employee and exec at Tinder but left the company in 2014 after suing for sexual harassment and discrimination. The case was eventually settled. But tension between the two dating companies has become increasingly palpable as a result of very public litigation between the Bumble and Match Group, Tinder's parent company. In March, Match Group targeted Bumble with a lawsuit accusing the company of patent infringement and stealing trade secrets. Bumble asked the court last week to dismiss the case. Separately, Bumble filed a counter lawsuit against Match Group. Bumble argues that Match Group is using litigation as revenge over failed acquisition talks. Both lawsuits are ongoing. While Bumble already operates in over 160 countries, India is a significant market because of its size. According to a report from Bain & Co, India has 390 million internet users, the second largest of any country behind China.

2016-03-07 00:00:00,2016,3.0,7,Stopping Zika: Putting mosquito genes into overdrive,"This is part four in a four-part series about the efforts to stop or slow the spread of Zika virus though the use of modified and engineered mosquitoes. See all four pieces here.   (CNN)University of California-Irvine microbiologist Anthony James says he's called the ""silverback"" -- the wise old man in the gorilla kingdom -- of gene drive researchers, because he's spent 30 years trying to find a way to genetically engineer an end to malaria, dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases.  ""I started my research program in 1986. And it's hard to convey that to people today, but no genes had been found in mosquitoes, much less the ability to splice, so it was starting from nothing. So I guess that's why they say I'm the silverback. I started working on it a long time ago and never gave up."" Today, labs around the world are filled with enterprising researchers using new tools such as CRISPR's Cas9 to splice a helpful gene into a mosquito's bloodlin--a gene that might interfere with the mosquito's ability to live a long life, reproduce or transmit disease In the case of Zika, it takes 5 to 14 days for a female mosquito to become infected with the virus after biting a human or animal who has an active case of the disease. If a gene can be edited so that it kills or alters the mosquito before she's infectious, you have effectively solved the problem. The gene drive takes that one step further by ""driving"" the new gene into subsequent generations at a much higher rate than the standard genetics you learned in school. ""It's forcing those genes into the population,"" explained molecular biologist Omar S. Akbari. ""This is the cutting edge of genetics. Instead of a gene being transferred to 50% of the offspring, now it can transfer to 99%, maybe even 100% of their progeny."" Gene drives take traditional genetically modified mosquito efforts and put them into overdrive. Take for example the Florida GMO mosquito called OX513A, created by a London company, Oxitec. ""Basically, Oxitec's technology is a single-generation technology,"" explained Akbari. ""You mass rear them. You release them. They mate out. They die. You do it again. And if you stop doing it, then they're all gone. Whereas with gene drive you create them, raise them in mass, then release them and it spreads like wildfire."" In other words, said Akbari, a gene drive is sort of a poor man's way of changing an entire population.  ""It's not a good company business model because you're not going to make money every generation,"" said Akbari. ""You're going to release it once and you're going to solve a world problem. That's the goal."" Forget Frankenstein -- think 'Chimera' Before you can ""drive"" a beneficial gene into a population, you have to create it. That's where genetic engineers can get really creative. Take what James and his team did to create a drive against one strain of malaria. ""A long time ago, colleagues of ours were studying human malaria parasites and they put them into mice,"" said James. ""The mice created antibodies to fight that off. So we went into the mice and got a couple of the antibody genes that are functional and put them in mosquitoes. So we gave the mosquito part of the mouse immune system that allows it to fight off human parasites."" ""Frankenstein's not a fair comparison,"" explains James, ""because Frankenstein was made of all human parts. We're making what's called a Chimera, an animal that is made from parts of several creatures."" And it's just that sort of genetic engineering that has the world of science in shock and awe, and some of the public picturing horror-flick mutant creatures running amok because some scientist didn't consider all the consequences. ""My argument to that is we know exactly what we put in the mosquito,"" said Akbari, ""and we can engineer ways of removing those from the mosquito or replacing those mosquitoes."" ""We've thought a lot about what could go wrong and this is where the engineering comes back in,"" agreed James. ""So we just build these with fail-safes so if for some reason the gene got out, it wouldn't work."" ""I also wouldn't say, 'In case we screw something up,'"" said Akbari. ""I would say, 'In case evolution does what it's good at' and basically the virus evolves and the mosquitoes are no longer able to suppress that virus somehow."" ""So, you're kind of at an arms race with evolution -- who is going to win?"" continued Akbari. ""And if evolution starts beating you, then the beauty of engineering is that you can go back in with a newer, better version."" Assuming gene drives make it past their ethical and environmental obstacles and prove themselves safe, how does all of this help fight Zika? That's still on the drawing board. ""We already have the blueprint,"" said James. ""We have a box full of parts and we would offer to make probably four or five different things that we would anticipate would work really well.""

2019-01-15 15:30:00,2019,1.0,15,I Got 'Brain Surgery' from a Doctor Whose Card I Found on the Street ,"This article originally appeared on VICE UK. I have spent quite a lot of time being stressed. When I was freelancing, I would roll out of bed and pick up a can of Red Bull in one swift, practiced motion. I would then down the energy drink before my eyes had even opened. Next, I'd sit at my laptop and type until I remembered to eat some food, which would be a handful of vegetarian sausages shoved in my mouth very quickly.  This is the life you chose, I would think, teeth grinding, confused about the time, panicking about my overdraft. If you keep working, maybe one day you will have some leisure. I feel less stressed these days. I have a job that doesn't destroy me, and I make a habit of prioritizing things that bring me happiness, like eating rice balls in bed or doing ""Word Up"" by Chromeo on Dance Dance Revolution. But we could all do with more relaxation—especially if you're a burnt out millennial. Most of us are broke. Our rented apartments are moldy. Our IKEA furniture is falling apart. We spend our time—our precious, finite alive time—in offices, or behind a cash register, or wherever pays the bills. Capitalism is a bitch, etc.  Which is why, when I was handed this card in the street the other day, I felt intrigued: ""Ultra relaxing"" and ""brain surgery"" aren't two concepts that usually go together, but neither are a lot of things—McDonald's fries and chocolate milkshakes—and that doesn't mean we shouldn't try them.  So, as soon as I got back to the office, I emailed ""Dr. Leon"" requesting an appointment right away. They replied saying I should arrive the following day at 12:30 PM, ring the doorbell, and begin my journey toward becoming a better version of myself. When the time came, I dragged my disheveled body down Brick Lane, where their ""clinic"" is based, and brought our intern along to take some pictures.  On arrival, I was greeted by Dr. Leon (otherwise known as Sofi Lee-Henson, the creator of XNN Systems), who was wearing a white coat and holding a clipboard. ""So good to meet you,"" she enthused, ushering me into what resembled a massage therapist's office with a vaguely medical edge, the air smelling faintly like essential oils. ""Please, make yourself comfortable."" She pointed to a soft chair, before playing me some pre-recorded videos of scientific-looking people talking about how I can become my ""better self"" through ""neural enhancement."" I was then asked to fill in a form where I wrote about how happy I currently am on a scale from one to ten (seven, sometimes eight); whether I most value love, knowledge, or power (love); and what I want to achieve after the session (creativity, productivity, a combo of the two?). Afterward, I was led to a massage chair in the corner, where Dr. Leon fastened some goggles and headphones onto my head and put some soft music on in the background.  ""Do you feel quite comfortable, Miss Jones?"" she asked. I nodded. ""Then we shall begin."" I can't really explain what happened next. Dr. Leon sprayed mint liquid in my mouth (""this can cause some patients to hallucinate"") and rubbed an unidentifiable gel on my forehead. She spoke about my ""better self"" microchip and how it will burrow into my ""brain sack."" At one point, my head started to softly vibrate, as if she was rolling a softened Nutribullet across my face. As someone who gets an almost ASMR-like sensation from going to the hairdressers or getting my eyebrows done, I found the experience extremely relaxing. When she told me the ""procedure"" was over and I could stand up, I felt dazed, as if someone had given me a head massage, or I'd had a nap.  Obviously, I realized quite quickly that XNN Systems is essentially immersive theater. It's too strange, too absurd, to be otherwise. Afterward, when out of character, Sofia told me she started the project six years ago, in conjunction with her Graphic Design degree at Central Saint Martins.  ""I'm not very spiritual,"" she told me. ""I'm not big on yoga; I could never get into meditation. So I got thinking about what access point could I use to get me more interested in mindfulness, and wellness—and science fiction was that for me. It was all about creating escapism, which was dependent on the audience member—and you get as much as you give."" The purpose of XNN Systems—which began as an offshoot of Secret Cinema—can be loosely considered as ""entertainment.” Sofia gets quite a few couples attending for first dates, for example, and it is clearly intended to be a performance. But it also fits snugly within faint, nebulous ideas about ""wellness,"" too, and a lot of people go for solely that purpose. ""My current aim is to explore theater and experience it as therapy,"" it says on the booking site. ""Exploring currently-used therapeutic techniques, my company XNN applies methods through experience, allowing escapism and the freedom for audiences to explore."" Obviously, this is all very vague, and Sofia has no formal therapeutic or medical qualifications, nor claims to. But it does bring up some interesting questions when it comes to the lengths we will go to in order to feel less stressed. When we spend however much on a massage, or a vampire facial, or cupping, or a sensory deprivation float tank, for example, are we really paying for the ""procedure"" and its supposed benefits, or are we paying for an hour in which we can feel personally cared for? In many ways, having fake brain surgery is no different than any of that. These treatments are also all considered guilt-free. Laying in bed in the middle of the day instead of working is seen as lazy. Laying on a massage chair after paying £40 [$51] for a ""therapeutic"" procedure (which is what this particular session would have cost) is just looking after yourself.  I didn't leave the ""surgery"" empty-handed. Sofia had secured a medical bracelet to my wrist upon arrival, and when I left she gave me a pot of ""development solution"" for ""aftercare."" The pot, of course, had nothing inside it. ""Fill to base of neck with your favorite drinkable liquid,"" it read on the label. ""Drink and repeat up to three times."" In some ways, the bottle is an apt metaphor for the whole thing. Forgive me for sounding like a philosophy student who just discovered Karl Marx, but in a climate as demanding as ours—one that teaches us that labor is money, and money is success, and therefore leisure is anti-money, and leisure is anti-success—it can be hard to make time for yourself. Relaxation is so fleeting, and so often full of guilt, that it can be easier to indulge in when it's dressed up as something medical, something beneficial to our betterment, something that might make us more productive.

2018-05-07 00:00:00,2018,5.0,7,Google launches Android Things for appliances as earlier spinoffs scramble to catch on,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O) on Monday launched a spinoff of its Android operating system for home appliances and other machines, following mixed results with Android offshoots for cars, smartwatches and televisions.  ‘Android Things’, which arrives as Google opens its annual conference for developers, could bring its Google Assistant virtual helper to refrigerators and robots and familiar designs to cash registers and vending machines.  “The goal is to enable them to be built faster, cheaper and more secure,” said Venkat Rapaka, a product management director at Google.   Android derivatives aim to provide users with a consistent interface across devices, while Google and its business partners benefit from a standard way to distribute their applications.  Though Google does not charge hardware manufacturers for Android, it expects to generate a return as consumers use new gadgets to use search, watch videos on YouTube and buy content from its Play Store.  The Android operating system powers many of the world’s smartphones and drives consumers to Google’s cash-minting apps.  But Google has struggled to extend Android’s dominance into other areas over the last four years, technology and financial analysts said.  “If you’re charitable, you say it’s early,” said Richard Kramer of Arete Research. “If you’re not, you say Android is irrelevant outside phones.”  Android Automotive is not yet deeply embedded in any cars. Shipments of smartwatches with Google’s Wear OS were outnumbered five-to-one by rival Apple Inc (AAPL.O) devices last year, according to research firm IDC. Four times as many smart TV shipments last year had Samsung’s (005930.KS) operating system as Android TV, according to IHS Markit.  In each category, Google’s Android system posted less market share last year than manufacturer-customized Android variants, which are less fruitful for Google because they typically are not pre-loaded or compatible with its apps.  Android variants thrive in China, where Google does not operate.   Google also has been slowed by resistance from carmakers to hand over a key interface, smartwatches from consumer electronics brands that failed to attract mass appeal and TV software that manufacturers found too rigid, analysts said.  Google officials said the spinoffs have momentum. Activations of Wear OS devices rose 70 percent late last year compared to the year-earlier period. Android TV activations doubled last year compared to the year before, while vehicles with Android embedded should arrive next year, company officials told Reuters.  South Asia and Latin America are bright spots, they said. Android TV had “tremendous traction over the last year” from Asian cable and satellite operators seeking it for set-top boxes, said Google product management director Shalini Govil-Pai.   Android Automotive was gaining attention from Indian automakers and from Brazil, said Patrick Brady, a Google engineering vice president.   Android Things competes with Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Greengrass system and Microsoft’s (MSFT.O) Windows IoT.   Google says it will guarantee three years of free security patches to hardware makers and paid extended options. It is also considering automated security scans of device makers’ apps.  Health technology startup Byteflies, an Android Things tester, said it viewed the system’s optional integration with Google’s cloud computing service and the large Android developer community as big advantages.

The EU’s executive Commission has handed down fines of more than 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) to Alphabet unit Google in the last two years and ordered it to change its business practices, following an investigation that showed the company abused its dominance. Last week, the EU competition enforcer sent out questionnaires to several companies, asking them about Google’s data practices and giving them a month to reply. The focus is on data related to local search services, online advertising, online ad targeting services, login services, web browsers and others. Companies were asked about agreements providing data to Google or allowing it to collect data via their services in recent years, and whether they were compensated for this. Regulators also wanted to know the kind of data sought by Google, how it uses it and how valuable the companies consider such data. Another question asked whether Google and the companies were subjected to contractual terms that prohibit or limit the use of the data. Regulators also wanted to know if Google had refused to provide data and how this affected the companies. The Commission declined to comment on the questionnaire and it was unclear which companies were canvassed. In an email to Reuters, Google said: “We use data to make our services more useful and to show relevant advertising, and we give people the controls to manage, delete or transfer their data. We will continue to engage with the Commission and others on this important discussion for our industry.” Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne",https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-alphabet-antitrust/eu-antitrust-regulators-seek-details-of-googles-data-practices-document-idUSL8N2895GB,Technology News,Reuters,technology,298

2017-08-23 00:00:00,2017,8.0,23,Watch: LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and web icon Tim O'Reilly debate the state of start-ups,"CNBC's Jon Fortt sat down with some heavy hitters in Silicon Valley to discuss entrepreneurship, venture capital and scaling start-ups on Wednesday in conjunction with the ""Fortt Knox "" podcast series. The panel includes LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who is a partner at venture capital firm Greylock and has served on the boards of companies such as Mozilla and Microsoft, and Tim O'Reilly, founder and CEO of O'Reilly Media, a pioneer in trends such as open-source software and defining Web 2.0 who also helps out at Indie VC. The discussion comes as ""unicorn"" start-ups are seeing valuations climb well past $1 billion, and technology giants such as Facebook and Amazon continue to compete with upstarts across industries, raising questions on how entrepreneurs can best compete. ""You either become a really successful giant or after a few years the VCs are done with you,"" O'Reilly said. Trying to compete with the big guys by raising a huge amount of money could unnecessarily dilute founders' stakes in their companies, O'Reilly said. He said that ""aggressive bros"" playing the ""hyper-scale"" game tend to get more funding than women of color, for example. ""This is a game, it is a horse race; by definition one or two players win, and all of the rest of them lose,"" O'Reilly said. ""The mythology is you have to raise huge amounts of money in order to get to scale. But it's also possible for small companies to get to scale."" Hoffman conceded there are problems with raising money: It could wear away a founder's financial discipline and push the company past what's sustainable. But he said that large-scale technology businesses create productivity across the economy, and that should be encouraged. ""If you can raise money at reasonable terms — and that doesn't necessarily mean nosebleed terms — that capital can help you navigate appropriately,"" Hoffman said. ""Raise more money than you think you need to be ready for all those things — everything from competition to pivots, to questions of suddenly exploiting opportunities."" O'Reilly said big technology companies should think about their role in enabling industries to be built on top of their platforms, versus just taking more profits. Hoffman pointed to autonomous vehicles, which analysts . But that could also create opportunities for new large-scale companies to create other jobs, from adult education to new industrial areas connected by the cars. ""Scale businesses can create a number of jobs,"" Hoffman said. ""And one of the things you really have to pay attention to is: If you're competing with blitz-scale competitors, that will make your outcome, if you're not blitz-scaling, much more in doubt. ... That will happen more often and more often in tech businesses, and more businesses are becoming tech businesses. "" But O'Reilly noted that not every business that's funded in Silicon Valley creates more value for society than it does for the founders. ""Many of your Silicon Valley entrepreneurs look a lot more like directors and actors — going hat in hand to Hollywood studios — than they do look like true entrepreneurs,"" O'Reilly said. ""There's kind of a lack of diversity in the investment community, which is reflected in the kind of opportunities that they want to pursue. I think it's also this very idea that the only things that are really worth going for is the unicorns ... leads you to filter out many things that are very, very worthwhile businesses.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/23/watch-linkedin-co-founder-reid-hoffman-and-web-icon-tim-oreilly-debate-the-state-of-start-ups.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,570
2018-03-19 00:00:00,2018,3.0,19,Credit Suisse AIC: Analyst says trade tensions won't hinder China's 5G ambition,"Ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China are unlikely to hinder the world's second-largest economy from moving ahead quickly with 5G mobile networks in its domestic market, an analyst told CNBC. The fifth generation (hence the 5G name) of mobile networks aims to provide faster data speeds and more bandwidth to carry ever-growing levels of web traffic. And the race to develop that technology has been heated because victory would allow companies to influence global standards. Last week, Reuters reported that U.S. President Donald Trump was looking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports and would target the technology and telecommunications sectors. That followed the U.S. government's decision to block Singapore-based Broadcom's proposed buyout of U.S.-based Qualcomm — a decision which was said to have been influenced by the threat of Chinese 5G efforts. ""Deals for overseas have already been blocked, but I don't think that stops the domestic Chinese market from being huge and moving ahead really quite quickly with 5G — probably in the second half of next year,"" said Colin McCallum, head of Asia telecommunications research at Credit Suisse. He explained that the plans would be for local Chinese companies to build up experience and then ""try to export that expertise and sell overseas."" ""What the trade relationships might be like in a year-and-a-half's time, two years' time, we'll just have to wait and see,"" McCallum told CNBC at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong. He added that overseas mergers-and-acquisitions-type transactions would be ""quite unlikely to happen in the near-term, for sure. But that shouldn't stop exporting."" The race to roll out 5G is on in the United States, China and other parts of Asia. Last year, the first specification for the technology was completed, which was considered a huge step toward commercialization. Some of the technology's capabilities were demonstrated at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in February. Beijing has been pushing the development of its 5G industry, favoring domestic names like Huawei and ZTE — both make equipment necessary for the technology to work. According to McCallum, China's large domestic market of 1 billion fourth-generation (4G) users gives it a ""very good head start for building critical mass."" He said he expects the first commercial wave of the technology to happen in 2019 at the earliest. Countries like China, Australia, South Korea and Japan would be the first within the Asia Pacific region to go ahead with 5G, according to McCallum. ""Interestingly, other operators around the region are really quite content with 4G,"" he said. ""It's brought video to everybody, to over a billion people in China (and) the cost of rolling out 4G is very, very low, relatively to 3G — 4G, I think, will end up being an elongated phase in quite a few markets."" Countries like Thailand and Indonesia might not roll out 5G until maybe 2021, he said. — CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/19/credit-suisse-aic-analyst-says-trade-tensions-wont-hinder-chinas-5g-ambition.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,493

We know it’s supposed to be 10 percent faster than the 820, that its quad-core CPU runs at 2.4GHz, and that it’ll first appear in Asus’ Zenfone 3 Deluxe. Today at IFA, Qualcomm gave us a better idea of what we can expect from the SoC, including the fact that maybe it’ll be the key hardware component for getting phones to run Google’s Daydream VR platform. Qualcomm says the new chip will include support for the Snapdragon VR SDK, which supports Daydream. So thanks to transitivity, the 821 will support Daydream, and through double transitivity, the Zenfone 3 Deluxe will support Daydream. Asus is, after all, one of Google's eight hardware partners for Daydream. It all makes sense! We do know that some older phones will work with Daydream, too, because ZTE said its Axon 7 is compatible with the platform. The 821 also reportedly has five percent better battery life and five percent better GPU speed. We don’t have confirmation on other devices that'll use the new chip, but wow the upcoming Android flagship phones are going to be tempting.",https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/31/12732122/qualcomm-snapdragon-821-vr-daydream-phones,Tech,The Verge,technology,192

In mid-April, AMD reported first-quarter revenue fell 19 percent year-on-year, with a net loss of $109 million. But the company indicated that second-quarter revenue could grow from the same period a year earlier, which would end a run of six straight quarters of decline. Su said AMD was looking to accelerate its market access in China when it signed a $293 million agreement to licence its processor technology to a joint venture it formed with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co, an investment unit of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The technology will help China produce its own server chips for datacentres, a market dominated by Intel Corp, one of AMD’s biggest rivals, along with Nvidia Corp. AMD has also completed a joint venture deal, first announced in late 2015, that brings in Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co. as a controlling partner in AMD’s chip test and packaging operation in Penang, Malaysia and Suzhou, China. Jiangsu-based Nantong Fujitsu paid AMD $371 million for an 85 percent slice of the venture. Reporting by J.R.

But she feels like her accomplishment is marred by her excess skin. The single mom squeezes her stomach weight into a waist trainer every day. “I feel like I’m kind of living a lie, because I strap this puppy up everywhere I go,” Carrilo, 28, says in this exclusive clip from Wednesday’s episode of Skin Tight. “When I go out I do get attention, but I’m sucked in, I have 100 things on me, and I’m sucking in all the time trying to look skinny at every angle.” The image she projects doesn’t match up with Carrilo’s interior monologue. “I’m thinking in my head, constantly, ‘I’m disgusting,’ ” she says. “I’ve tried to accept the way I am, but I can’t and I won’t. I’ve come this far; I want to finish this journey.” Carrilo was able to lose the weight through weight loss surgery, which she elected to undergo after a lifetime of overeating. “I was big my whole entire life,” she says. “Not only am I six feet tall, but I was just always heavier. And I always heard, ‘Oh my god, if only your body matched your face, you could run the world.’ “ She says her family would try to feed her healthy meals, but her dad was an abusive alcoholic who would attempt to make up for his behavior with candy and cookies. After high school, Carrilo got pregnant and didn’t have the support of the baby’s father. “I was so unhappy. And again I turned to food, and I continued to gain weight,” she says. “Eventually we broke up, and I was alone. Just a young mom feeling sorry for myself. I wouldn’t leave the house. I would just sit and eat. And in two years I gained at least 80 lbs.” Carrilo knew she had to make a change when she weighed herself for the first time in years. “I bought a scale because I never kept a scale at my house, and I went home, weighed myself and it said 375, and I couldn’t believe it. I was in shock,” she says. “I knew I needed to do something, not only for me. I had to step up and get my health right for my daughter.” Now 194 lbs. down, Carrilo has changed her physical health, but her self-esteem is still low because of her excess skin. Her hope now is to get skin removal surgery, and have the confidence to be a good mom to her daughter.

The deal comes as Tennessee-based LifePoint and many of its peers face higher medical costs, fewer patient admissions and changes to reimbursement policies in Medicare and Medicaid that have pressured profits. However, to compensate for the downturn, LifePoint has been beefing up its presence in rural regions including in Pennsylvania and Tennessee and streamlining operations at health-care facilities there. The deal will bring together LifePoint and Apollo's RCCH HealthCare Partners, LifePoint said in a statement, confirming a Reuters report on Friday that the parties were in advanced talks for a buyout. Apollo's deal — its biggest this year — is the latest in a recent surge in public investments by U.S. private equity, the highest since the 2007-08 global financial crisis. With a record $1 trillion in cash at their disposal, top private-equity names have turned to health care. Just last month, KKR and Veritas Capital each snapped up publicly listed healthcare firms in multibillion-dollar deals. Indeed, hospital operators are alluring to investors, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Joseph France said. Because their operations are largely U.S.-based, hospital firms benefit more from lower tax rates than the average U.S. company, and are also more insulated from global trade uncertainties, France said. Apollo's transaction value includes $2.9 billion of LifePoint's net debt and minority interest. The combined company will be led by current LifePoint Chief Executive Officer William Carpenter III. LifePoint shares down some 27 percent in the past year jumped nearly 34 percent to $64.00 in premarket trading, $1 shy of Apollo's all-cash offer price. Barclays, Citigroup, RBC Capital Markets and Credit Suisse will finance Apollo's acquisition. PSP Investments Credit USA and an affiliate of Qatar Investment Authority will also provide part of the debt financing.

2017-01-01 19:00:00,2017,1.0,1,The Neurons That Would Starve You,"Hunger is complicated. It's not merely a single drive, though this is mostly how may experience it consciously: a single dimension of hunger magnitude. We are more or less hungry, sometimes not at all. But there's something else lurking in the brain: anti-hunger. We can be hungry and not hungry simultaneously, in a sense. In more concrete terms, we can imagine that there is in the brain a certain subset of ""hunger neurons."" When we feel hungry—as during periods of fasting—it means that these neurons are active. Otherwise, the hunger neurons are silent. Hunger neurons are quite real: neuroscientists have demonstrated their function by stimulating hunger neurons artificially, causing mice to eat at weird times and gain weight. But something interesting happens as we start cranking hunger neurons (agouti-related protein, or AgRP, neurons) up. There's a limit. Mice won't just eat themselves to death. This indicates that there's something else to hunger, a moderating factor. This factor is described for the first time this week in Nature Neuroscience by researchers at Harvard Medical School: a new population of neurons that intermingle with AgRP neurons and basically have the opposite effect. Anti-hunger. Anti-hunger is in itself not a brand new idea. For a long time, neuroscientists looked to pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, which are likewise intermingled with the AgRP hunger neurons, for filling this role. This is reasonable: genetic mutations and manipulations to the POMC neurons have been observed to lead to obesity in mice. Further research, however, hasn't borne out the POMC anti-hunger hypothesis. ""Chemogenetic and optogenetic activation of POMC neurons has little effect on short-term feeding behavior, suggesting that other neurons are involved in meal termination,"" Richard Palmiter, a biochemist at the University of Washington, explains in a perspective accompanying the new paper. ""Hence, POMC neurons appear to be more important for long-term body-weight homeostasis."" Why should we even expect that short-term hunger-quenching neurons exist? For one thing, the AgRP neurons do something kind of unexpected when the body is presented with food. Rather than wait for the stomach to feel full or for the body to start releasing metabolism-related hormones, these neurons flip off even before the first bite of food. Yet, we keep eating until we are full, or at least not hungry. Instead, feeding eventually stops as these various feedback mechanisms trigger the new neural circuit described in the current paper, which is located in a part of the brain called the solitary nucleus, or NTS. These neurons project into multiple parts of the brain that also happen to be connected to POMC and AgRP neurons. ""Activation of ARC glutamatergic neurons rapidly reduced food intake by 50 percent during the time when mice normally eat,"" Palmiter writes. ""Conversely, inactivation of these neurons during the day stimulated food intake. Consistent with these observations, these glutamatergic neurons are more active during the fed state and are inhibited by neighboring AgRP neurons."" So, what can we actually do with this information? Not much at the moment. We're still at the very early stages of understanding this stuff. The interplay between how the body actually senses hunger and satiety (""fullness"") is finally coming into focus, but neuroscientists have a long ways to go. For now you'll have to diet the old fashioned way.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z43k99/neuroscientists-isolate-hunger-fighting-neurons,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,542

The service, which will begin trials in Japan next month before expanding nationwide in November, aims to provide centimeter-level positioning to the autonomous tech that is beginning to be introduced across a range of industries, SoftBank said. Japan’s newly launched constellation of Michibiki satellites has been offering high-precision location data since last November, and SoftBank’s service will be an early attempt at building a commercial business with it. Despite the government backing, Japan is seen as lagging other countries in areas such as autonomous driving and the use of drones in part because of onerous legal restrictions. Kajima Corp, one of Japan’s big four construction firms, will trial the service with construction site monitoring drones. SoftBank’s own SB Drive, which is developing self-driving tech for buses, will also run trials. SoftBank is expanding its backing for the nascent field of autonomous driving on multiple fronts including Monet, a self-driving car venture set up with Toyota Motor. SoftBank’s parent SoftBank Group Corp’s portfolio companies control 90% of the world’s ride-hailing industry and it has taken stakes in self-driving units at Uber Technologies and General Motors Co. Those investments come despite disappointment with speed of development in the self-driving industry, which has failed to deliver on earlier bold promises of commercial autonomous cars.

2020-03-12 00:00:00,2020,3.0,12,A new Twitter client finally gives us the power to edit tweets — sort of,"Brizzly, a Twitter client that first launched in 2009, is back with a new goal to serve the needs of all the world’s Twitter power users. The company is launching its Brizzly Plus service today, a subscription that costs $6 per month, or $60 annually, and gives people access to non-native Twitter features like an undo button and auto-deletion. The undo button allows subscribers to set a delay between when they type and send their tweet and when it posts. They can choose between no delay, a 10-second delay, or a 10-minute delay. During that time, they can click “undo,” which cancels the tweet and gives them time to edit. They can redo any tweet, too, which allows them to make changes, tweet again, and Brizzly will delete the old tweet. It’s not technically an edit, but it streamlines the process because Brizzly copies the text from the offending tweet automatically. Meanwhile, auto-delete allows users to choose between 24 hours, one week, or one month to have their tweets deleted, regardless of whether they were sent through Brizzly. If users do want to save certain tweets, they can do so with a feature called “Fave to Save,” which lets them set any number of likes as a threshold, and tweets that meet it will be saved from deletion. Auto-deletion is a feature that other third-party services pioneered, and it’s one that people have seemingly enjoyed. Still, Twitter doesn’t natively allow for it. People have also asked Twitter to build an edit button, but CEO Jack Dorsey has said it’ll “probably” never happen. He said it defeats the original purpose of Twitter. “We started as an SMS, text message service. And as you all know, when you send a text, you can’t really take it back,” he said in January. “We wanted to preserve that vibe, that feeling, in the early days.” But that’s not stopping Brizzly from working around Dorsey’s wishes. Is an edit button worth  up to $70 per year, though? I guess it depends on how many typos you make on a daily basis.

The investigation is focusing on an Uber program, internally known as ""Hell,"" that could track drivers working for rival service Lyft Inc, the WSJ said, citing people familiar with the investigation. Under the program, which was discontinued last year, Uber created fake Lyft customer accounts to seek rides, allowing it to track nearby Lyft drivers and ride prices, the Journal said. This also allowed Uber to obtain data on drivers who worked with both the car-ride providers and could have allowed it to lure drivers to leave Lyft with cash incentives, WSJ added. Uber was not immediately available for comment. The key question for investigators was whether the program comprised of unauthorized access of a computer, the newspaper reported. The investigation is being led by the FBI's New York office and the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, the Journal said. Uber is already grappling with a range of legal troubles and the report of the FBI investigation comes days after the company named Expedia's Dara Khosrowshahi as its chief executive.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/08/fbi-probing-if-uber-used-software-to-interfere-with-rivals-wsj.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,198
2020-02-13 00:00:00,2020,2.0,13,Samsung and Apple's war for the high-end smartphone is leading to ridiculous prices,"New York (CNN Business)Samsung kicked off its ""Galaxy Unpacked"" event in San Francisco on Tuesday with a slick promo video introducing its new folding smartphone, the Galaxy Z Flip. Rebecca Hirst, Samsung's UK head of marketing, took the stage to tout the phone as being ""like nothing you've ever experienced before.""  It all seemed to be going so well as she talked through the phone's specs and features. Then came the price reveal: $1,380.  ""That's kind of a mixed response,"" Hirst said to scattered applause.  It wasn't even the most expensive smartphone Samsung unveiled that day. The top-of-the-line version of its new flagship, the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, starts at $1,399. If you get a 512 GB version, the price ticks up to $1,599.99. The Samsung event highlights the new normal for the smartphone industry. In 2017, Apple shocked the world by charging $999 for the iPhone X. Many outlets questioned whether consumers would ever pay that much for a phone. Now, as Apple and Samsung compete for the high-end market, there are a growing number of smartphones that cost well over $1,000.  Two of Apple's newest smartphones, the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, start at $999 and $1099, respectively. The latter can cost as much as $1,449. And you can't get any of Samsung's newest phones for less than that once unthinkable price tag of $999. Even Motorola is charging $1,500 for a smartphone reboot of its Razr flip phone that comes with a plastic screen, a small battery and a fairly average camera by today's standards. But that didn't stop enthusiastic (and maybe nostalgic) customers from lining up. Motorola had to push the new Razr's launch date because of high demand.  Contrary to what some may have assumed two years ago, smartphone users appear more than willing to shell out four figures on what may well be considered luxury products.  ""Consumer preference has been going towards going more high-end in general,"" Maurice Klaehne, an analyst at Counterpoint Research, told CNN Business.  Klaehne says the high price points of recent devices are dictated partly by the fact that customers are holding onto their smartphones for months — or even years — longer than they used to before upgrading.  ""Apple and Samsung, in particular, were seeing the market kind of peak in terms of how many phones are being bought year over year,"" he said. ""So they're looking for ways to maximize their profit.""  Newer technologies like folding displays and 5G, both of which Samsung is leaning heavily on with its latest lineup, also make it easier to justify charging more — at least for now, Klaehne said.  Samsung is counting on its head start in 5G, the next generation mobile technology that allows users to download a movie in seconds, to pull in customers. With the new Galaxy S20 series, the company now has eight 5G-enabled phones on the market. The Galaxy S20+ and S20 Ultra are even equipped with a higher-bandwidth millimeter wave 5G, requiring them to have an extra antenna that drives up the manufacturing cost further. (Apple's first 5G iPhone isn't expected to come out until later this year.) But as these newer technologies become more common the cost could eventually drop.  Indeed, as pricey as the Galaxy Z Flip may be, it actually started around 30% cheaper than last year's $1,980 Galaxy Fold, Samsung's first foray into folding smartphones that was delayed for months because of defective displays.

The package includes state loan guarantees to ease payment schedules for existing loans of up to 1 billion euros, and additional revolving loans of up to 500 million to help firms with liquidity problems, the government said in a statement. The package includes also direct salary support totalling 250 million euros to the companies hit worst by the virus. The government said it was working also on additional investments and changes to legislation, and it would present an additional budget for 2020 by mid-April.

2017-09-28 17:23:01,2017,9.0,28,"Otto Warmbier Suffered Extensive Brain Damage, Coroner Confirms","Otto F. Warmbier, the college student imprisoned in North Korea and returned to the United States in a vegetative state, suffered extensive brain damage following interrupted blood flow and a lack of oxygen, according to the coroner who examined his body. But an external examination and “virtual autopsy” conducted by the coroner’s office in Hamilton County, Ohio, could not determine how his circulation had been cut off. “All we can do is theorize, and we hate to theorize without science backing us up,” Dr. Lakshmi Sammarco, the county coroner, said in an interview Thursday. Mr. Warmbier, 22, an undergraduate at the University of Virginia, was convicted in March 2016 of trying to steal a propaganda poster while on a trip to North Korea and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. He was flown back to the United States in June in a vegetative state. North Korean officials said Mr. Warmbier’s condition was caused by sleeping pills and botulism, a diagnosis that medical experts doubted. He died six days later at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. His parents requested that a full autopsy not be performed. On Tuesday, during an appearance on the television show “Fox & Friends,” Fred Warmbier said that his son had been “tortured” and described North Korean officials as “terrorists.” After the interview, President Trump said in a tweet that Mr. Warmbier “was tortured beyond belief by North Korea.” On Thursday, North Korea’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement denying again that Mr. Warmbier had been tortured and accusing the United States of “employing even a dead person” in a “conspiracy campaign” against North Korea. Dr. Sammarco’s examination, which was concluded earlier this month, did not find signs of torture but could not rule out the possibility. “There are a lot of horrible things you can do to a human body that don’t leave external signs behind,” Dr. Sammarco said. “One of the frustrating things is the lack of information about what happened to him in North Korea,” she added. In a virtual autopsy, pathologists rely on an examination of the body and on scans to determine what has happened to it. Mr. Warmbier was returned with brain scans done in North Korea in April 2016 and again in July 2016. M.R.I. scans were done at the medical center after he arrived, which also performed a whole-body CT scan after Mr. Warmbier’s death. The images clearly showed that his brain had been starved of oxygen and that large tracts of cells had died, Dr. Sammarco said. The medical diagnosis is anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. That condition differs from the damage that occurs during a stroke, when a single blood vessel is blocked, said Dr. Lee H. Schwamm, executive vice chairman of neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital. With an injury like Mr. Warmbier’s, “blood flow is reduced everywhere — the pump is turned off,” said Dr. Schwamm, who reviewed the coroner’s report at The Times’s request. In the United States, the most common cause is a cardiac arrest, often precipitated by a heart attack. While cardiac arrests are unlikely in healthy young men, they can happen if the victim is malnourished and suffers an imbalance of blood electrolytes, such as potassium, calcium, or magnesium, Dr. Schwamm said. The damage is quick: It takes just four minutes without blood for brain cells to start to die. Blood flow to the brain can be interrupted for any number of reasons. The whole-body CT scan did not find injuries associated with hanging, for example, but Dr. Schwamm said the evidence might not be visible if a bedsheet were used and the spine were not dislocated. Mr. Warmbier had a scar at the base of his neck that was probably caused by the insertion of a tube into his trachea as he was hooked up to a ventilator. This may indicate that he was not breathing on his own for a long period of time, Dr. Sammarco said. He was weaned from the ventilator in North Korea, though; he was not using it when he was returned. There were few other signs of injury on Mr. Warmbier’s body. There were no bedsores, and his skin condition was excellent, Dr. Sammarco said. “His muscle volume was pretty good for someone who was bedridden for over a year,” she said. In the United States, most families would opt for palliative care for a relative in a vegetative state resembling Mr. Warmbier’s, she added. That would consist of providing pain medications and sedatives to soothe them. Doctors do not know whether these patients suffer from pain and anxiety, Dr. Sammarco said. But they often groan and make jerky movements. The case has attracted global attention and inflamed international tensions. Dr. Sammarco said she offered to turn the examination over to federal authorities. “If there were national or international implications, we would be happy to relinquish jurisdiction and cooperate in any way necessary,” she said. Federal officials declined, she added.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/health/otto-warmbier-north-korea-autopsy.html,health,The New York Times,health,823

(Warning: The video contains some language that viewers may find offensive.) The video is not an actual recording of Obama. It's a highly edited video that digitally alters footage of Obama to make his mouth mimic a voice actor's movements. The audio of the speech was recorded by Oscar-winning filmmaker Jordan Peele. The clip eventually shows a split screen of Obama and Peele, revealing the ruse. ""This is a dangerous time,"" Peele says, still impersonating Obama. ""Moving forward we need to be more vigilant with what we trust from the internet. It's a time where we need to rely on trusted news sources.""

2016-02-28 22:00:00,2016,2.0,28,What Is this Weird Particle Ribbon at the Edge of the Solar System?,"When it comes to charting the outer regions of the Solar System, astronomers may as well use the colloquial phrase ""here there be dragons."" As much as we still have to learn about our direct planetary neighbors, like Mars or Venus, we are even more in the dark about the mysterious expanse beyond Pluto, where hulking undiscovered planets may roam and the Sun's influence wanes before the boundary to interstellar space. For instance, one of the strangest phenomena observed in the far reaches of the Solar System is the IBEX ribbon, named after NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) satellite, which discovered it in 2008.  This so-called ribbon is an intense stream of neutral particles that has been called a ""roadmap in the sky,"" with regards to studying the murky interstellar magnetic field beyond the Sun's influence.  Think of it like this: solar wind and magnetism create a kind of cosmic harbor, called the heliosphere, that extends about 90 astronomical units (AU) around the Sun (one AU is defined as the distance between the Earth and the Sun). All known planets are moored well inside these protected waters.  However, outside the harbor, in the interstellar medium, the ocean is much wilder and harder to predict. Moreover, just as eddies and riptides occur on the frontiers between harbors and open ocean, the IBEX ribbon is somehow generated by the transitional zone, or heliosheath, between the Solar System and the wider galactic void. Now, in a new study published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, a team led by Eric Zirnstein, a space scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, demonstrate that the underlying dynamic underneath the IBEX ribbon is likely to be solar blowback.  ""The theory says that some solar wind protons are sent flying back towards the sun as neutral atoms after a complex series of charge exchanges, creating the IBEX ribbon,"" said Zirnstein in a statement. ""Simulations and IBEX observations pinpoint this process—which takes anywhere from three to six years on average—as the most likely origin of the IBEX ribbon."" In other words, the Sun ejects a bunch of protons in the solar wind, many of which pick up hitchhiker electrons that help them sneak past the heliopause, the gateway to the heliosheath.  But if some of these now-neutral atoms happen to lose their electron friends in these brave new waters, then gain new ones at exactly the right time and place, they can be shot back through the heliopause, creating aurora-like phenomena such as the IBEX ribbon. It's as if these charge-hopping atoms are prodigal children, destined to return back to the heliosphere that bore them, while their brethren rush forth to larger galactic vistas. Many recent studies support this model, as do the observations of Voyager 1 and 2, both of which recently passed into the heliosheath. On top of that, Zirnstein's team was able to simulate the strength and direction of the interstellar magnetic field with great accuracy using this model.  But there are still several competing theories about the ribbon out there, so it's not yet an open-and-shut case at this stage.  ""The new findings can be used to better understand how our space environment interacts with the interstellar environment beyond the heliopause,"" said IBEX program scientist Eric Christian in a statement.  ""In turn, understanding that interaction could help explain the mystery of what causes the IBEX ribbon once and for all.""",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/aekvpk/what-is-this-weird-particle-ribbon-at-the-edge-of-the-solar-system,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,568
2016-11-11 00:00:00,2016,11.0,11,"Financial firms seek RegTech to cut regulatory chores, fight crime","HONG KONG (Reuters) - Financial services firms are increasingly turning to digital technology to meet onerous regulatory demands aimed at fighting financial fraud, creating a niche tech market that is estimated to grow to around $120 billion by 2020. Regulatory technology, or RegTech, offers banks automated solutions that can speed up the cumbersome process of vetting clients and transactions, which is necessary to prevent money laundering and other financial crimes. Regulators are also looking for more standardized digital transaction reports from banks to spot potential fraud more reliably and with fewer staff. “The demand for this is enormous, everybody needs it,” said Peter Hetz, a director at Veridate Financial, whose software helps family offices and fund managers verify the identity and background of new clients and create reports for regulators. Speaking at the Thomson Reuters Pan Asia Regulatory Summit this week, officials at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and markets watchdog Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said they saw major opportunities for technology to help financial firms meet growing regulatory requirements. “Crooks will always exist, but you can reduce the risk. If you haven’t been doing your job in risk and compliance with technology, I’d be incredibly surprised,” Benedicte Nolens, head of risk and strategy at Hong Kong’s SFC, told the summit. “It’s not only superior in a number of factors, it’s probably a lot (cheaper) and it’s certainly a lot faster” than banks’ back offices, she added. Consultancy Quinlan & Associates estimated in a report this week that one such technology, blockchain, could cut the costs that banks incur to comply with anti-money laundering rules by $4.6 billion a year – or 32 percent of current annual costs – through reduced headcount, technology spend and regulatory fines. Start-ups like Hong Kong-based Veridate and FixNix, which automates audit and risk tasks for small firms in India, are betting that as financial firms look to avert regulatory fines and focus on their core businesses, more of their compliance budget will go to technology. Veridate said its automated audit process can reduce the time to sign up a new client at banks and asset managers to several minutes from weeks currently. By digitizing different tasks, watchdogs can also request regular checks to make sure banks’ clients remain compliant and monitor potential risk and fraud more closely. The SFC is launching a pilot project with 20 banks to monitor and detect systemic risk using RegTech. In India, FixNix signed an agreement to offer its software to hundreds of community banks through the Reserve Bank of India’s technology arm. “Having partnerships with regulators opens many doors,” said Shanmugavel Sankaran, founder and CEO of FixNix.

2018-12-13 12:07:58,2018,12.0,13,N.I.H. to Scrutinize Private Donations to Scientific Research Projects,"After halting a discredited alcohol study, officials will enforce new policies to ensure that private support does not compromise scientific integrity. Six months after halting a study of moderate drinking that was underwritten by donations from the alcohol industry, the National Institutes of Health outlined a series of steps to prevent similar conflicts of interest and to safeguard the integrity of its research and its reputation. In a report issued on Thursday, N.I.H. officials said its 27 institutes must evaluate all current research projects that receive private donor support for conflicts of interest of the kind that compromised the alcohol trial. The institute directors are to report their findings to Dr. Francis Collins, director of N.I.H., early next year. “We have to do everything we can to ensure the integrity of the N.I.H. grants process and the quality of our research is above reproach, which means worrying about conflicts,” Dr. Collins said. The Times reported in March that the principal investigator of the alcohol study, along with an official from the N.I.H., had approached the alcohol industry on several occasions to solicit corporate support for a study of moderate drinking. The investigator shared details of the design of the trial and had suggested the results would reflect well on moderate drinking, possibly leading to official advice endorsing a daily drink to prevent heart disease. The report also called for N.I.H. officials to examine the motives of private donors offering gifts, determining whether donations are given unconditionally or with the expectation of desired results from scientific research. The recommendations also included ensuring that the N.I.H., and not private donors, make final decisions about trial design and data analysis. Dr. Lawrence A. Tabak, the principal deputy director of the N.I.H. who presented the new policy recommendations, said they will buttress the agency’s standards and provide uniform enforcement across the institutes. “We want to make sure we’re doing it completely consistently across the agency,” Dr. Tabak said. Critics worried that the reforms did not go far enough. “What, you mean the N.I.H. isn’t doing this already?” said Marion Nestle, a professor emerita at New York University who has studied how food industry funding influences nutritional science. There is ample evidence that corporate-funded research yields results that are favorable to the sponsor “whether or not the donor explicitly expects a quid pro quo,” she said. The Foundation for the N.I.H., a nongovernmental entity, raises private money and funnels these donations to the institutes. Since 1996, it has raised nearly $1 billion in private money for research, officials said. The foundation currently funds dozens of research projects at the N.I.H. The foundation should only accept unrestricted private gifts not earmarked for specific research and directed to the agency’s top priorities, Dr. Nestle said. ”Anything short of that risks bias and loss of research integrity and trust,” she added. “N.I.H. sets a world-class standard for research integrity and also must maintain the highest possible standards for protecting that integrity.” The report does not recommend a halt to public-private partnerships for scientific research or demand changes in the operations of the foundation, which served as the conduit for alcohol company donations toward the alcohol trial. “These recommendations are weak and will not prevent industry influence,” said Dr. Adriane Fugh-Berman, a professor of pharmacology and physiology at Georgetown University and director of Pharmed Out, a group that advocates evidence-based drug prescribing. Instead, N.I.H. research should be exclusively funded by Congress, without contributions from private sources, she said. The new report also does not address gaps in the scientific review processes used to vet N.I.H. studies, which failed in the case of the alcohol study to identify and modify serious design flaws that could have led to false conclusions. Dr. Collins said public-private partnerships are critical to carrying out N.I.H. research on important diseases like diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and others. Dr. Tabak and other N.I.H. officials absolved the Foundation for the N.I.H. of any culpability in the alcohol trial debacle, saying the foundation was deceived by officials at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, which initiated that study. The new policy recommendations, delivered by Dr. Tabak at a meeting of the advisory committee to Dr. Collins, noted that the alcohol study had cast a shadow over the government agency’s reputation for sound, impartial research. The report said the problems that came to light in the alcohol trial “threaten public trust,” and that public-private partnerships must be reviewed with an eye to “assessment of reputational risk to the agency.” “There were many things that had gone wrong” in the alcohol trial, which resulted in a flawed trial design and a selection process for a principal investigator that was “wired” for a certain outcome, Dr. Collins said. It is now important to “ascertain whether this could be going on in other places.” “It’s one of these moments you hope will not happen,” he added. “You’ve got to learn from them and put in place appropriate steps so it does not happen again.” Many of the new recommendations underscore guidelines that were presumed to be in effect, he said. “Had we had all these things in place and insisted on certain things and the institute had followed through, it wouldn’t have happened the way it did,” Dr. Tabak said of the alcohol study. “We’re saying to the world, ‘We’ve got to start looking at this to make absolutely certain, because of what happened,’” he added. The report calls for more rigorous disclosure of conflicts of interest, and for written disclosure of all interactions between scientists, N.I.H. officials and private donors. The report urges greater transparency about N.I.H. funding opportunities, so as to ensure fair competition among outside researchers vying for grants.

Twitter's board is trying to figure out whether they can sell the company before making any cuts, as CEO Jack Dorsey is pushing his board for more time to execute his video strategy, sources told CNBC. Right now, the Twitter board is focused on third-quarter revenue and user numbers ahead of an earnings report a few weeks away, sources told CNBC. Also on the radar is a live-streaming deal with the NFL, which has been successful, but has not likely bolstered the core user number, the sources said. It comes after unnamed sources told the Wall Street Journal that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has been building a case to buy Twitter, calling the company an ""unpolished jewel,"" according to a report published late Tuesday. Salesforce declined to comment to CNBC, but Benioff told CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" on Wednesday that when considering acquisitions, he looks at a lot of things, but passes on most. ""It's in our interest to look at everything,"" Benioff said. ""We have to go deep on everything. We have to understand what is possible for our shareholders and what isn't."" Google also declined to comment. A bid for Twitter could destroy $12 billion to $17 billion in value for Salesforce, Mizuho analyst Abhey Lamba wrote in a research note. That value could take two to three years to recapture, he said. ""We remain concerned about management's quest for acquiring Twitter,"" Lamba wrote. ""Management did not directly address the issue but there is too much information in media to ignore the potential."" The Journal report indicated that it could receive takeover bids as soon as this week. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that Twitter's board and Dorsey were in conflict on whether to explore a sale of the company, amid inquiries from Disney, Salesforce and Google. That report indicates bids could come within a ""couple of weeks — or not at all."" Twitter shares, meanwhile, rose more than more than 5 percent on Wednesday. Chris Sacca, an early investor in Twitter, told CNBC that Twitter could be ""complementary "" to many companies, including Google, Salesforce, Microsoft and Facebook. Still, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Robert Peck indicates that such a merger would be material to Salesforce, while it would be significantly less dilutive to larger companies like Alphabet or Disney. Salesforce has already been on a ""spending spree,"" buying a series of artificial intelligence companies, writes BTIG analyst Joel Fishbein. While Twitter has access to valuable data, Peck raises questions about the unverified nature of many user profiles on the site, which often features ""not safe for work"" content from ""bots."" Shares of Twitter have risen almost 45 percent over the past three months, amid multiple reports that it might move closer to a sale.

2018-02-05 17:14:00,2018,2.0,5,Depressed People Use These Words More Often,"Sign up for Coping, Tonic's weekly newsletter about anxiety, mental health, and dealing with it all. From the way you move and sleep, to how you interact with people around you, depression changes just about everything. It is even noticeable in the way you speak and express yourself in writing. Sometimes this “language of depression” can have a powerful effect on others. Just consider the impact of the poetry and song lyrics of Sylvia Plath and Kurt Cobain, who both killed themselves after struggling with depression. Scientists have long tried to pin down the exact relationship between depression and language, and technology is helping us get closer to a full picture. Our new study, published in Clinical Psychological Science, has now unveiled a class of words that can help accurately predict whether someone has depression. Traditionally, linguistic analyses in this field have been carried out by researchers reading and taking notes. Nowadays, computerized text analysis methods allow the processing of extremely large data banks in minutes. This can help spot linguistic features which humans may miss, calculating the percentage prevalence of words and classes of words, lexical diversity, average sentence length, grammatical patterns and many other metrics. So far, personal essays and diary entries by depressed people have been useful, as has the work of well-known artists such as Cobain and Plath. For the spoken word, snippets of natural language of people with depression have also provided insight. Taken together, the findings from such research reveal clear and consistent differences in language between those with and without symptoms of depression. Language can be separated into two components: content and style. The content relates to what we express—that is, the meaning or subject matter of statements. It will surprise no one to learn that those with symptoms of depression use an excessive amount of words conveying negative emotions, specifically negative adjectives and adverbs—such as “lonely”, “sad” or “miserable”. More interesting is the use of pronouns. Those with symptoms of depression use significantly more first person singular pronouns—such as “me”, “myself” and “I”—and significantly fewer second and third person pronouns—such as “they”, “them” or “she”. This pattern of pronoun use suggests people with depression are more focused on themselves, and less connected with others. Researchers have reported that pronouns are actually more reliable in identifying depression than negative emotion words. We know that rumination (dwelling on personal problems) and social isolation are common features of depression. However, we don’t know whether these findings reflect differences in attention or thinking style. Does depression cause people to focus on themselves, or do people who focus on themselves get symptoms of depression? The style of language relates to how we express ourselves, rather than the content we express. Our lab recently conducted a big data text analysis of 64 different online mental health forums, examining over 6,400 members. “Absolutist words”—which convey absolute magnitudes or probabilities, such as “always”, “nothing” or “completely”—were found to be better markers for mental health forums than either pronouns or negative emotion words. From the outset, we predicted that those with depression will have a more black and white view of the world, and that this would manifest in their style of language. Compared to 19 different control forums (for example, Mumsnet and StudentRoom), the prevalence of absolutist words is approximately 50 percent greater in anxiety and depression forums, and approximately 80 percent greater for suicidal ideation forums. More from Tonic: Pronouns produced a similar distributional pattern as absolutist words across the forums, but the effect was smaller. By contrast, negative emotion words were paradoxically less prevalent in suicidal ideation forums than in anxiety and depression forums. Our research also included recovery forums, where members who feel they have recovered from a depressive episode write positive and encouraging posts about their recovery. Here we found that negative emotion words were used at comparable levels to control forums, while positive emotion words were elevated by approximately 70 percent. Nevertheless, the prevalence of absolutist words remained significantly greater than that of controls, but slightly lower than in anxiety and depression forums. Crucially, those who have previously had depressive symptoms are more likely to have them again. Therefore, their greater tendency for absolutist thinking, even when there are currently no symptoms of depression, is a sign that it may play a role in causing depressive episodes. The same effect is seen in use of pronouns, but not for negative emotion words. Understanding the language of depression can help us understand the way those with symptoms of depression think, but it also has practical implications. Researchers are combining automated text analysis with machine learning (computers that can learn from experience without being programmed) to classify a variety of mental health conditions from natural language text samples such as blog posts. Such classification is already outperforming that made by trained therapists. Importantly, machine learning classification will only improve as more data is provided and more sophisticated algorithms are developed. This goes beyond looking at the broad patterns of absolutism, negativity and pronouns already discussed. Work has begun on using computers to accurately identify increasingly specific subcategories of mental health problems—such as perfectionism, self-esteem problems, and social anxiety. That said, it is of course possible to use a language associated with depression without actually being depressed. Ultimately, it is how you feel over time that determines whether you are suffering. But as the World Health Organisation estimates that more than 300 million people worldwide are now living with depression, an increase of more than 18 percent since 2005, having more tools available to spot the condition is certainly important to improve health and prevent tragic suicides such as those of Plath and Cobain.

2020-03-03 00:00:00,2020,3.0,3,"Ampere targets cloud companies with new chip, signs Oracle as customer","(Reuters) - Data center chip startup Ampere on Tuesday released a new processor that it claims can outpace offerings from Intel Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc, and said it has signed Oracle Corp’s cloud division as a customer. Led by former Intel president Renee James, Ampere’s processor uses technology from Softbank Group Corp-owned Arm Ltd, whose chip architecture powers most phones and tablets. Phone chips are often designed for efficiency to conserve battery life, but since its founding two years ago Ampere has focused on layering in its own technology to scale up Arm-based processors to compete with data center chips. These can use hundreds of watts of electricity to power the back end of websites and cloud services such as those from Microsoft Corp or Amazon.com’s cloud unit. Ampere designed its new Altra chip for cloud providers, who themselves rent out computing power to other businesses. Because businesses spend tens of billions of dollars on cloud services, small differences in chip speed or power consumption can mean hundreds of millions of extra dollars in sales or savings for the providers. “They can focus their resources on the thing that makes them the most money, which is building their outstanding services, and we give them a new level of performance and efficiency,” James said in an interview. Microsoft Corp said Tuesday it is testing Ampere’s chips in its labs. Oracle on Tuesday said that it plans to use Ampere’s processors for its cloud service and is customizing much of its software, including its widely used database systems, to run on Altra chips. James sits on Oracle’s board. Oracle disclosed last year that it had invested $40 million in Ampere. Shane Rau, a research vice president at market research firm IDC, said cloud providers have become such huge buyers of chips that they constitute a major market on their own. “Just having one of those customers adopt you en masse can provide you a business,” Rau said. “That’s part of what Ampere is looking for.” Ampere faces hurdles. Amazon, the largest cloud provider, is building its own Arm-based chip. And while Ampere’s speed claims will have to proved in real world usage, Intel’s chips have a decades-long track record. But cloud providers have the technical savvy and financial incentives to consider new chips, especially for fast-emerging fields such as artificial intelligence. “There’s not going to be one winner, not like the PC market,” said Richard Wawrzyniak, a principal analyst with Semico Research Corp. Ampere’s chips “compete very well with Intel on several performance metrics, and AMD also. I think the market would like an alternative,” he said.

2018-02-06 13:00:00,2018,2.0,6,Climate Change Could Unleash Huge Amounts of Mercury From Permafrost  ," As our planet warms, habitats are undergoing major transformations, and permafrost regions are among the most impacted. These landscapes, which typically remain frozen all year round, are showing signs of thaw, such as underground methane bubbles. Now, research published Monday in Geophysical Research Letters exposes another worrisome consequence of thawing permafrost—mercury (Hg) contamination. Led by Paul Schuster, a hydrologist at the US Geological Survey in Boulder, Colorado, the study’s authors examined 13 drill cores collected from a variety of Alaskan permafrost sites to create the first estimate of Northern Hemisphere mercury storage of its kind. Shockingly, Schuster’s team found that “permafrost soils store nearly twice as much Hg as all other soils, the ocean, and the atmosphere combined,” according to the study. “Before this, the global budgets of mercury just assumed little or no mercury in permafrost but our measurements indicate that’s exactly the opposite,” study co-author Kevin Schaefer, a research scientist at the National Snow & Ice Data Center, told me in a phone call. “Not only is there mercury, it’s the biggest pool of mercury on the planet,” he said. About 15 million gallons of mercury, from this initial estimate, is locked away in these Northern permafrost areas (mercury is in Southern hemisphere permafrost regions too, but this study focused on the North). That’s about 10 times the amount of mercury pollution caused by humans over the past 30 years. If these regions continue to defrost, this toxic element could escape into soil, water, and air. “Mercury gets uptaken by plants either through the roots or the leaves where it becomes incorporated into the organic material by mimicking nutrients like iron or magnesium,” Schaefer explained. As plants die and decay, he said, microorganisms feeding on them release mercury into the air along with nitrogen and other gases. Mercury poisoning can have far-ranging impacts on ecosystems and human health, especially because it is bioaccumulative, meaning it tends to amass in animals that are higher in the food web, particularly aquatic predators. Exposure to mercury can be fatal, so the reality that our warming planet might unleash untold amounts of it has serious medical and environmental implications. It would be particularly damaging to people that rely on permafrost ecosystems for their food, and in Alaska, that burden may fall disproportionately on remote subsistence communities, including Indigenous groups. But before you integrate this frightening new revelation into your Doomsday prep spreadsheet, take some temporary solace in the fact that a lot of research still needs to be done. Over email, Schuster told me that his team is already collecting more cores around the circumpolar belt—including from Russia, Scandinavia, and Canada—to bolster this study, and that data will be integrated into models of permafrost mercury release, based on similar research into the global carbon cycle. “We’re going to figure out how much permafrost and organic matter is going to thaw out, how much mercury is going to be released, where it’s going to be released, and in what form,” Schaefer said. “Is it going to go out through the atmosphere, or the water system?

2016-11-01 11:00:00,2016,11.0,1,Ancient Graves Suggest Revenge Killings Are Older Than We Thought,"The University of Arizona researchers noticed something strange about the ancient grave they were examining in the Sonoran Desert. The deceased had died brutally—but that wasn't the weird part. The body had been thrown in the grave haphazardly, as if the man meant nothing to the gravediggers. The prehistoric clues led them to one conclusion with a surprisingly modern theme: Blood feuds. Blood feuds were cycles of violence where families were pitted against other families and eventually established cultural divisions—like mob families or the Montagues and Capulets in ""Romeo and Juliet"". And in a recent study published in Current Anthropology this month, researchers think they found evidence of them at burial sites in Southwest US and northern Mexico from civilizations that lives between 2100 B.C. to 50 A.D. The archaeological evidence could be early examples of revenge as a way to exhibit dominance, creating a cycle where families and societies fought each other through generations—much like today's gang violence. ""With some of the issues that we're seeing today—like increased violence and murders in a lot of cities, police shootings, retaliation upon police—a lot of kids are growing up in a culture of violence in certain communities, and they're learning different values on how to interact with their environment because of the disadvantages that they have,"" said James Watson, a University of Arizona anthropology professor, in a statement. ""They gain status because they're good at being violent; that's how you gain respect, then along with that comes advantages—wealth, women and offspring, potentially. There is a biological imperative to signal that they are worthy of the status they're trying to earn."" The discovery of skeletons with broken skulls and punctured bones indicated they were killed violently, according to the study. And these bodies were discovered thrown head-first into graves or generally tossed into graves, which indicates no care was taken for a ritual burial. This could suggest the denial of a traditional burial, which could indicate the person was hated by the individual burying them, the researchers said. That could signify a blood feud among families within a specific tribe since these cultures would typically bury their dead in a flexed, fetal position on their sides with special items. These graves didn't have any items alongside the bones. ""These people were buried very differently than the rest of the community, and we're trying to understand why that is,"" Watson said. ""We're arguing that the way they were tossed into these pits is a form of continued desecration of the body. It's moving from violence on the living individual, through to the process of death, to violence on the corpse."" The Arizona researchers think that denying the families the ability to bury their loved ones was a way to send a message about the deceased person's status in the society and the increased status of the person who killed him. But at the same time, such ill treatment of these bodies invited revenge from their families. ""This was right when agriculture came into the area, and these were the earliest villages, so we think that some of this violence comes from growing pains, as villages are established and people are claiming territory and farming the desert river valleys,"" Watson said. ""Social tensions develop between communities, or even within communities, and end up boiling over into violence.""

2018-03-29 00:00:00,2018,3.0,29,Thousands of UK Teens Will Help Settle a Vaccine Debate Over Meningitis ,"UK scientists want to know whether it’s worth vaccinating teens against a certain type of bacteria that causes meningitis called Neisseria meningitidis, seen above.Image:  James Volk (CDC)Scientists in the UK are looking to recruit thousands of teens (presumably with attitude) to help them settle a debate over whether vaccines for a certain type of meningitis should be in wider use.The nationally funded study, coined the Teenagers against Meningitis, or TEAM, trial, will corral 24,000 teenagers from ages 16 to 18 living in 14 towns and cities across the country. They’ll be randomly divided into three groups. One group will receive a placebo shot at first, while the other two will get one of two currently licensed vaccines tailored to prevent meningitis  B. The vaccine groups would get a second dose six months later.Via throat swabs taken at the beginning at the trial and at the one year mark, the researchers intend to see just how protected the vaccinated teens actually are against meningitis B, compared to the control group. Afterward, the unvaccinated teens would  get the real shots as well (because they deserve protection, too). The researchers will also try to suss out whether the program is providing herd immunity to the surrounding unvaccinated community.“Participants will not only get a vaccine that reduces their risk of meningitis but also help us understand if we can prevent the bug being carried and potentially spread to others,” said study investigator Matthew Snape, a researcher at the University of Oxford, one of the many research sites taking part in the trial, in a statement.Meningitis is simply what doctors call an inflammation of the meninges, the protective layers that coat our brain and spinal cord. Its symptoms include a high fever, headache, and rash, though it can progress into full-blown sepsis and death.Lots of things cause meningitis, but the most common bacterial culprit is called Neisseria meningitidis. There are 13 broad types, or serogroups, of N. meningitidis known to exist, five of which can cause human disease (A, B, C, W, and Y). The bacteria likes to nest in our throats, and as many as one in every 10 people carry it without any problem. The trouble begins when it finds its way elsewhere in the body. It can be spread through close, prolonged contact with infected saliva or snot, a category that includes making out.A vaccine that covers all non-B types of meningitis has been around since the 1970s. But it was only after the advent of a better non-B vaccine in 2005 that countries like the US strongly recommended the shot for children ages 11 to 12, along with a booster shot at 16. The first meningitis B vaccine debuted in 2015, but doctors in the US were reluctant to endorse it as a routine shot, citing concerns about its safety and that it might not be worth vaccinating the general population, given the disease’s rarity. The UK did add it to its routine vaccination schedule for children under the age of 12 months, though it similarly chose to not recommend it widely for anyone else at the time.While cases of bacterial meningitis are rare, with only 350 cases diagnosed in the US in 2015, it remains an incredibly scary threat. Even with prompt medical treatment, 10 to 15 percent of patients die from it, while 11 to 19 percent develop long-term complications like deafness or brain damage. And after infants, people from the ages of 16 to 24 are most at risk of contracting it. In recent months, at least two outbreaks of bacterial meningitis have hit colleges in the US, both caused by serogroup B, prompting large vaccination drives.The TEAM trial is expected to start this April, with recruitment ongoing for the next 18 months.[University of Oxford]",https://gizmodo.com/thousands-of-uk-teens-will-help-settle-a-vaccine-debate-1824154338,Health,Gizmodo,health,627
2016-02-13 00:00:00,2016,2.0,13,App shakes up earthquake science by turning users into sensors,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Smartphones could become the makeshift quake detectors of the future, thanks to a new app launched Friday designed to track tremors and potentially save the lives of its users. MyShake, available on Android, links users to become an all-in-one earthquake warning system; it records quake-type rumblings, ties a critical number of users to a location, and could eventually provide a countdown to the start of shaking. Its inventors say the app, released by the University of California, Berkeley, could give early warning of a quake to populations without their own seismological instruments. “MyShake cannot replace traditional seismic networks like those run by the U.S. Geological Survey,” said Richard Allen, leader of the app project and director of the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory. “But we think MyShake can make earthquake early warning faster and more accurate in areas that have a traditional seismic network, and can provide life-saving early warning in countries that have no seismic network.” Earthquake-prone countries in the developing world with poor ground-based seismic network or early warning systems include Nepal, Peru, Pakistan, Turkmenistan and Iran, he said. The algorithm behind MyShake, developed by a handful of Silicon Valley programmers, relies on the same technology smartphone gamers depend on to sense the phone’s orientation, known as the accelerometer, in order to measure movement caused by quakes. What smartphones lack in sensitivity - they can only record earthquakes above magnitude 5 within 10 kilometers (6 miles) - they make up for in ubiquity. Currently, 300 smartphones equipped with MyShake within a 110-km square area are enough to estimate a quake’s location, magnitude and origin time. There were some 3.4 billion smartphone subscriptions worldwide in 2015, according to the Ericsson Mobility Report, so the app’s creators hope to build a seismic network covering the globe. “We want to make this a killer app, where you put it on your phone and allow us to use your accelerometer, and we will deliver earthquake early warning,” Allen said. Sophisticated early-warning systems can warn of coming quakes as much as a few minutes before they begin, but cannot stop them causing death and destruction on a large scale. Nepal is still rebuilding after two separate earthquakes in April and May 2015 that killed 9,000 people, injured more than 22,000 and damaged or destroyed nearly 900,000 houses.

2017-10-04 00:00:00,2017,10.0,4,Google Clips: AI-powered camera,"Alphabet's Google group on Wednesday unveiled a funky new pocket-sized camera called Google Clips that's designed to capture meaningful moments without you needing to click the shutter. Like an increasing number of other Google products, the $249 camera relies on artificial intelligence. Whenever it's on, Google Clips is constantly looking out for certain people, facial expressions like smiles, and other indications that it should record footage, Google product manager Juston Payne said at Google's hardware event in San Francisco on Wednesday. The automatic editing capability is reminiscent of the small company Graava's miniature camera. ""It looks for stable, clear shots of people you know, and you help the camera learn who's important to you,"" Payne said. ""And finally, all the machine learning happens on the device itself, so just like any point-and-shoot, nothing leaves your device until you decide to save and share it."" That last part is important — AI tasks can require complex computing, and historically Google has been very reliant on that for AI on mobile devices in particular, but Google has made it possible for Clips to work its magic locally. Additionally, a Now Playing feature on the second generation of Google's Pixel smartphones ""detects what song is playing and matches it with tens of thousands of song patterns on your phone"" to quickly identify it without ever reaching out to cloud servers for assistance, Google senior director of product management Sabrina Ellis said at the Google event. This isn't the first time Google is doing a type of artificial intelligence computation locally on a mobile device. For example, in 2015 Google made it possible for people to automatically translate text that people captured with the cameras on their phones. What's notable this time is that Google is positioning Now Playing and the Clips camera as examples of ""on-device machine learning."" Just a few months ago, Apple was talking about that when it introduced Core ML, a system developers can use to make AI models work inside iOS apps, without pinging the cloud.

2019-12-06 00:00:00,2019,12.0,6,"Study links hair dyes and chemical straighteners to higher breast cancer risk, particularly among black women"," (CNN)Permanent hair dye and chemical hair straightener use was linked to a higher risk of breast cancer in a new study from researchers at the National Institutes of Health. The risk is more than six times higher for black women.  The study, published Wednesday in the International Journal of Cancer, followed 46,709 women, all part of the Sister Study, a National Institute of Environmental Health cohort of women whose sisters had been diagnosed with breast cancer. (Family history of breast cancer is considered a risk for developing breast cancer.) It found that, overall, women who said they used permanent hair dye in the year before enrolling in the study were 9% more likely to develop breast cancer when compared with women who did not.  The risk was substantially higher among black women. Black women were less likely to use permanent hair dye but significantly more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer after using it.  Permanent hair dye was associated with a 45% higher risk of breast cancer in black women and 7% higher in white women.  Frequency was key, too. Black women who dyed their hair every five to eight weeks had a 60% higher risk for breast cancer.  Chemical hair straightener use was associated with an 18% higher breast cancer risk among black and white women, though black women were far more likely to use the product -- 74% of black participants reported doing so versus just 3% of white participants.  Breast cancer incidence is rising among black women, a 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report found, and there are numerous racial disparities in health care access, quality and affordability that may hinder treatment.  Studies may never prove what causes cancer There's an important consideration in interpreting the results: The study analyzes association, not causation. The women in the study were already at a higher relative risk for breast cancer because of their family history.  Definitively identifying causes of breast cancer might be limited by current science, said Dr. Otis Brawley, professor at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health and former chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society.  ""Maybe these products cause cancer, maybe they don't,"" said Brawley, who was not involved with the study. ""But maybe this is something that science simply just cannot answer.""   A decisive answer, he said, would require a longitudinal study of thousands of black women who use or do not use these chemicals, which is widely considered impractical and unethical.  There are other cancer risks women can control, Brawley said, and they're more strongly supported by research.  Tobacco use, obesity, an excess of calories and a lack of exercise are the leading preventable risk factors for cancer that people can change, he said. They're linked to at least 12 cancers, including breast and endometrial cancers.  Alcohol consumption, too, is more clearly linked to risk of breast cancer than chemical dyes and straighteners, he said.  What's to be done What can women do with results like these?  The study noted that the risk of breast cancer was lower in women who permanently dyed their hair in a professional setting, like a salon. Stylists might be less likely to expose clients' skin to the dye chemicals, Brawley theorized. Hair products contain more than 5,000 chemicals, the authors write, and most of the dyes and straighteners did not ""reliably document"" ingredients on the label.  The study doesn't pinpoint which of the chemicals caused the damage, but makes some suggestions: Some aromatic amines, chemicals also found in tobacco smoke and industrial byproducts, disrupt the endocrine system, and some dyes have been found to induce tumors in rats' mammary glands.

2016-02-08 00:00:00,2016,2.0,8,Risk of suicide increases three-fold after a concussion,"(Reuters Health) - Adults who suffer a concussion are at three times the long-term risk of suicide compared to the general population, according to a new study from Canada. Unlike some previous research, the new work focused on adults in the general population rather than either athletes or military personnel with head injuries. “For years there have been examples of serious head injuries leading to potential cases of suicide in military veterans and professional athletes,” said senior author Dr. Donald A. Redelmeier of the University of Toronto in Ontario. “I always worried that even mild concussions acquired in normal community settings might also be a risk, and might cause lasting damage,” he told Reuters Health. The researchers analyzed medical records for adults in Ontario with a diagnosed concussion that was not serious enough to require hospitalization and followed them from 1992 to 2012. More than 230,000 people fell into this category. Over an average follow-up period of nine years, 667 people who had experienced concussions committed suicide, which is equivalent to a rate of 31 suicides per 100,000 people per year. That’s more than three times higher than the suicide rate in the general population, according to the results. In Canada there are an average of about nine suicides per 100,000 people annually, Redelmeier said. Weekend concussions appeared to carry an even higher risk of suicide than weekday concussions, the researchers note in CMAJ. Weekday concussions may happen at work, where there is a treatment protocol, but weekend concussions may be easier to shrug off without really slowing down, Redelmeier said. Suicide risk after a concussion increased regardless of a patient’s past history of psychiatric conditions. “It’s incredibly important to put these things into perspective – the vast majority of people in this study did not die from suicide,” Redelmeier said. “Approximately 4 to 5 million concussions occur annually (in the U.S.),” said Craig J. Bryan of the University of Utah department of psychology in Salt Lake City, who was not part of the new study. “Also, concussion appears to increase risk for sleep disturbance and depression, and can affect decision-making processes,” Bryan told Reuters Health by email. “All of these are risk factors for suicide in their own right.” The study does not prove that concussions cause some suicides, as they may be connected in a different way, Redelmeier said. People who suffer concussions could be predisposed to suicide beforehand, or a concussion might cause lasting injury to neurons in the brain that never recover, or people who suffer a concussion and don’t take enough time to recover may be doing further damage, he said. “For example, concussions are much more likely to be experienced by individuals who drink alcohol a lot or get into fights,” Bryan said. “Alcohol use and aggression are also risk factors for suicide.” “If you’ve just been diagnosed with a concussion the standard medical advice should be enforced, give yourself plenty of time to sleep,” Redelmeier said. “Once you start feeling better, don’t try to come back with a vengeance.” “Once you are better, don’t forget about it entirely,” he said. “If you had a concussion 15 years ago maybe you also want to mention it to your physician.” SOURCE: bit.ly/1Q3FF3h CMAJ, online February 8, 2016.",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-concussion-suicide-idUSKCN0VH1T5,Health News,Reuters,health,542
2019-11-22 00:00:00,2019,11.0,22,Drone firm in talks in Uganda on medical supply delivery deal,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - A drone service firm is in talks with the Ugandan government on a deal to deliver blood packages, drugs and medical equipment to public health facilities, an executive told Reuters on Friday. A deal could see Uganda join a small number of other African countries, such as Ghana and Rwanda, that have deployed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to help public health logistics. Uganda’s public hospitals often face shortages of essential supplies, such as blood, drugs, syringes, gauze and gloves, sometimes due to unreliable transport through the gridlocked capital or along poorly paved or dirt roads in the countryside. John Goslino, business manager at Flexdrone, told Reuters the drone services firm launched by a Ugandan and a German aimed to start a delivery service in March if talks were successful. He said the service had already secured approval from the Information and Communications Technology Ministry and they were awaiting an endorsement from the Health Ministry. “We are trying to provide the products that are needed by the patient and the health worker who is working in the village when that person needs it,” Goslino said. Most smaller public health facilities in Ugandan do not have proper facilities to store blood and supplies often need to be transported across long distances in an emergency. Ugandan media have in the past reported deaths due to delayed blood deliveries. Goslino said his firm had partnered with Ugandan start-up firm Sysimo Technologies to develop a mobile app for the on-demand delivery service. Flexdrone planned to deploy drones capable of carrying 5 kg each but could use bigger drones as demand grew, he said. A similar service led by Zipline, a California-based robotics company, was launched in Ghana. Rwanda has been operating a similar service since 2016.

In April, Hungary detected its first cases of African swine fever (ASF) among wild boar in a north eastern region. The highly contagious, devastating viral disease of pigs has been spreading across Eastern Europe in recent years. Russia, Poland, Ukraine and Romania are among the countries affected by ASF, alarming governments and pig farmers due to the pace and distance of its reach. Although no domestic pigs have been infected by ASF in Hungary, some of the biggest foreign markets for Hungarian pork products, including Japan and South Korea, reacted to the outbreak by imposing temporary import bans or restrictions. Laczko, whose farm in Zebegeny sits near the banks of the Danube, said that since the outbreak the authorities had imposed “many restrictions.” His mangalica pigs are bred outdoors, and he has had to build an extra double electric fence to prevent contact with wild boar. In the last two months, Hungary has detected 17 cases of African swine fever in dead wild boar in the north east, according to data from the food safety authority NEBIH. “We can say that the Hungarian domestic pig ... production is safe till now,” said the country’s chief vet Lajos Bognar. But Bognar said that 10 countries, most of them from Asia, had imposed restrictions on Hungarian pork imports for the time being. He said his rough estimate of the cost of the ASF outbreak to the industry so far was around 11 billion forints ($40.3 million) so far. Gyula Nagy, a pig farmer in Rabacsecseny, west of Budapest, who has 2,500 pigs, said the outbreak was hurting his livelihood. “The price of our slaughter pigs has ... dropped by 10 percent, plus our export possibilities have also decreased,” he said. Nagy said an export deal with Serbia he had been working on fell through because of the ASF outbreak. Serbia was one of the countries to have imposed temporary import bans. Other measures, including hunting bans, were also being put into place, but mangalica breeder Laczko says these may not be enough to halt the advance of the deadly virus. “The main problem that it comes from the Ukraine and until that tap is turned off, the virus will keep spreading and all measures will be just minimal fire extinguishing,” he said.

2018-08-02 20:08:00,2018,8.0,2,"Protecting Golfers from Wasps Is Part of a Golf Course’s ‘Duty,’ Rules California Court"," A California woman who sued a golf course after she nearly died from being attacked by wasps on the greens had some success this week. In an appeal, a court has ruled that property owners, including golf courses, have a “duty” to protect patrons from dangerous insects on their property. In July 2013, Carolyn Staats was taking a private golf lesson at Vintner’s Golf Club in Napa Valley. While teeing up at the fifth hole, she was suddenly swarmed by dozens of yellow jackets—a predatory social wasp that has black and yellow stripes and is really nasty. Getting attacked by wasps is no fun in any circumstance, but this was a particularly horrible case. Staats was stung more than 50 times, missed more than a month of work, and was “within 15 seconds of dying,” according to a paramedic who treated her at the scene, the court record shows. Staats—who is now deathly allergic to the wasps and has to carry a cache of EpiPens everywhere she goes—sued the golf course for “general negligence and premises liability.” The trial court that first heard her case threw it out, claiming that protecting golfers from stinging insects management didn’t know were there goes beyond the scope of maintaining a “reasonably safe” property. (The day after the attack, it took an exterminator 15 minutes to find the tiny nest, which was hidden under a lump of grass.) But in the appeal, the judges ruled that protecting folks from deadly insect stings falls under the scope of a reasonable expectation of safety. “Golf course operators are not exempted from exercising reasonable care to protect their patrons against the foreseeable risk posed by yellow jacket nests on their premises,” stated the decision. The case will now go forward to determine whether or not the club did everything that was reasonably expected to protect patrons. But it’s now been formally established in the state of California: if you own a golf course, you should probably do a regular sweep for wasps.

2018-07-12 13:00:00,2018,7.0,12,Why Bury Broadband Fiber When You Can Just Glue It to the Road?,"One of the biggest hurdles with closing the digital divide is cost: it’s really expensive to dig trenches and run fiber optic cable out to the far, rural reaches of the country. So a new startup has patented an idea they hope will bring down costs significantly, and help bridge the gap: glueing fiber to the blacktop.  “My dad lives out in a rural part of Virginia and he was having trouble getting good internet connectivity, so that was the impetus of the whole idea,” Daniel Turner, the startup’s founder and CEO, told me over the phone. “I looked at what infrastructure is already connecting all of us together and it hit me, it’s the roads.” Turner’s DC-based startup TRAXyL, first reported on by the blog Government Technology, has patented a technique that uses a blend of resins to stick fiber optic cables along roadways and protect them from weather and traffic. Inspired by his sister, who is a pediatric dentist, Turner adopted the same kind of UV-cured resin used for teeth fillings, and combined it with methyl methacrylate, an ultra tough resin developed in Europe as an alternative to paint to use for road markings.  By removing the need to dig, or get access to telephone poles, Turner believes he can greatly reduce the cost of installing fiber to the premises infrastructure in hard-to-reach places. The cost estimates for laying fiber varies depending on the region and terrain, but it can cost as much as $100 per foot. Turner thinks with scale, his technique can cost as little as $5 per foot to install.  TRAXyL currently has six pilot projects in three different states to test out the durability and reliability of this kind of network. One pilot, in Stillwater, Oklahoma, has been up and running for almost a year. The city installed a gigabit fiber network across a parking lot to hook up the city’s traffic control system, and it’s giving the technology a true ground test. “They’re driving heavy machinery on top of it,” Turner told me. “They’ve been driving trucks over it, forklifts, heavy machinery and so they’re really getting good use out of it right now.”  But an exposed fiber cable on the blacktop, even if it’s protected by a thick layer of resin, is a liability. It certainly won’t last as long as buried cables, creates a greater risk of outages, and is limited: it can’t go over railroad crossings, for example. Christopher Mitchell, director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance’s Community Broadband Networks Initiative, told me that while he thinks there’s some potential for this technology, it’s far from a panacea.  “I have no doubt that in the first several years this technology works great, I’m concerned about how it fares after five years,” Mitchell said.  He told me he could see this technique being useful for establishing a network quickly and affordably, but using it as a temporary stopgap while building a larger, buried network.  Turner told me he wants the technology to be a complement to existing infrastructure techniques, rather than a replacement. Using it to connect multiple wireless towers, for example, rather than to connect every home that those towers serve.  Mitchell said any technology that helps make building infrastructure more affordable is useful, but at the end of the day, rural internet will only be built if and when ISPs or, more likely, local governments decide to invest in it. “What would help solve the digital divide is if governments got serious about wanting to solve the digital divide,” he said. “Technologies that lower the cost of doing it will help, but fundamentally there is so little real emphasis on doing it today that it will not make that big of a difference.”    Listen to our podcast  about the world’s greatest mysteries that were solved by science.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ne5v7m/why-bury-broadband-fiber-when-you-can-just-glue-it-to-the-road,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,638
2019-12-06 00:00:08,2019,12.0,6,"Fake ‘Likes’ Remain Just a Few Dollars Away, Researchers Say","Despite Big Tech’s attempts to combat manipulation, companies that sell clicks, likes and followers on social media are easy to find. “A very #MerryChristmas⁠ ⁠to all,” Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s top antitrust enforcer, wrote on Facebook last December. Her post attracted 144 “likes.” A few months later, as an experiment, researchers paid a company a few dollars to attract attention to her well wishes. In 30 minutes, the post had 100 more likes. The researchers had similar results on a holiday post on Ms. Vestager’s Instagram account and on a Christmas tweet from Vera Jourova, the European Union’s justice commissioner. Companies like Facebook and Twitter are poorly policing automated bots and other methods for manipulating social media platforms, according to a report released on Friday by researchers from the NATO Strategic Communications Center of Excellence. With a small amount of money, the researchers found, virtually anyone can hire a company to get more likes, comments and clicks. The group, an independent organization that advises the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, tested the tech companies’ ability to stop paid influence campaigns by turning to 11 Russian and five European companies that sell fake social media engagement. For 300 euros, or about $330, the researchers bought over 3,500 comments, 25,000 likes, 20,000 views and 5,000 followers, including on posts from prominent politicians like Ms. Vestager and Ms. Jourova. After four weeks, about 80 percent of the fake clicks remained, the researchers said. And virtually all of the accounts that had been used to generate the clicks remained active three weeks after researchers reported them to the companies. The report spotlights the continuing challenges for Facebook, YouTube and Twitter as they try to combat online disinformation and other forms of online manipulation. After Russia interfered in the United States’ 2016 presidential election, the companies made numerous changes to reduce the spread of online disinformation and foreign interference. In recent months, the platforms have announced takedowns of accounts in China, Saudi Arabia and, most recently, Africa, where Russia was testing new tactics. But the report also brings renewed attention to an often overlooked vulnerability for internet platforms: companies that sell clicks, likes and comments on social media networks. Many of the companies are in Russia, according to the researchers. Because the social networks’ software ranks posts in part by the amount of engagement they generate, the paid activity can lead to more prominent positions. “We spend so much time thinking about how to regulate the social media companies — but not so much about how to regulate the social media manipulation industry,” said Sebastian Bay, one of the researchers who worked on the report. “We need to consider if this is something which should be allowed but, perhaps more, to be very aware that this is so widely available.” From May to August, the researchers tested the ability of the social networks to handle the for-hire manipulation industry. The researchers said they had found hundreds of providers of social media manipulation with significant revenue. They signed up with 16. “The openness of this industry is striking,” the report says. “In fact, manipulation service providers advertise openly on major platforms.” The researchers bought engagements on about a hundred posts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. They saw “little to no resistance,” Mr. Bay said. After their purchase, the researchers identified nearly 20,000 accounts that were used to manipulate the social media platforms, and reported a sample of them to the internet companies. Three weeks later, more than 95 percent of the reported accounts were still active online. The researchers directed most of the clicks to posts on social media accounts they had made for the experiment. But they also tested some verified accounts, like Ms. Vestager’s, to see if they were better protected. They were not, the researchers said. The researchers said that to limit their influence on real conversations, they had bought engagement on posts from politicians that were at least six months old and contained apolitical messages. Researchers found that the big tech companies were not equally bad in removing manipulation. Twitter identified and removed more than the others, the researchers found; on average, half the likes and retweets bought on Twitter were eventually removed, they said. The researchers found YouTube the worst at removing inauthentic accounts and the most expensive to manipulate. The researchers reported 100 accounts used for manipulation in their test to each of the social media companies, and YouTube was the only one that did not suspend any and provided no explanation. Facebook, the world’s largest social network, was best at blocking the creation of accounts under false pretenses, but it rarely took content down. Instagram, which Facebook owns, was the easiest and cheapest to manipulate. “Fake engagement tactics remain a challenge facing the entire industry,” Facebook said in a statement. “We’re making massive investments to find and remove fake accounts and engagement every day.” Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, a department at Oxford University, said easy social media manipulation could have implications for European elections this year and the 2020 presidential election in the United States. “Fake engagement — whether generated by automated or real accounts — can skew the perceived popularity of a candidate or issue,” Ms. Bradshaw said. “If these strategies are used to amplify disinformation, conspiracy and intolerance, social media could exacerbate the polarization and distrust that exist within society.” Ms. Bradshaw, who reviewed the report independently, said the reason accounts might have not been taken down was that “they could belong to real people, where individuals are paid a small amount of money for liking or sharing posts.” This strategy, she pointed out, makes it much harder for the platforms to take action. Still, she said the companies could do more to track and monitor accounts associated with manipulation services. And the companies could suspend or remove the accounts after several instances of suspicious activity to diminish inauthentic behavior. “Examining fake engagement is important because accounts don’t have to be fake to pollute the information environment,” Ms. Bradshaw said. “Real people can use real accounts to produce inauthentic behavior that skews online discourse and generates virality.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/06/technology/fake-social-media-manipulation.html,technology,The New York Times,technology,1024

Now, copycats are trying to do the same, scouring the internet for other vulnerable databases. The first copycat hacker has so far taken control of almost 1,000 databases, but there are at least another four hackers trying the same tactic, according to a tally by security researchers, putting the total number of hijacked databases to over 10,000. ""YOUR DBS ARE ENCRYPTED. SEND 0.5 BTC (BITCOIN) ~= 550USD, TO THIS BTC ADDRESS,"" reads the ransom message of the first copycat, who calls himself 0wn3d, according to Victor Gevers, the co-founder of the GDI Foundation, a non-profit organization that has the goal of making the internet safer, and one of the researchers who's tracking these attacks. Please STOP paying the ransom. There is no evidence that they actual copied your database. Get a local expert to have your log files checked Victor GeversJanuary 5, 2017 As of Friday morning, 0wn3d has made 2 bitcoin (around $2,000 at the current exchange rates) after four victims paid up, according to Bitcoin blockchain data. (A message to the email that the hacker left in their ransom messages was not returned). Gevers has been working around the clock to track these attacks and help IT administrators secure their MongoDB database installations to avoid becoming victims. ""I have been helping some organisation (small and bleeping large) help locking down their databases,"" Gevers told Motherboard in a Twitter message. ""I have helped 59 directly with SSH about 9 with information."" According to Gevers, 0wn3d actually doesn't steal the data, but simply creates a new database and drops the ransom note, erasing the old data. ""This actor does not have any data so paying ransom is a bad idea,"" Gevers told me. In the last year, MongoDB databases, which are among the most popular after Oracle, have been at the center of several leaks and data breaches, not because of a vulnerability or any particular exploit, but because in past versions the installation didn't require owners to set up credentials by default. Security researchers have found several MongoDBs containing sensitive information left exposed for all to see, such as the voter records of 191 million American voters, or credit card data of thousands of customers of an hotel chain. MongoDB published a blog post on Thursday giving users advice on how to avoid becoming victims of this attack. Just like in the past, the company said there was no security issue with its software, and that it was users' responsibility to follow ""security best practices"" and use the software's ""extensive security capabilities."" Gevers was also the one who discovered the original ransom attacks earlier this week, carried out by a hacker calling themselves Harak1r1, who was able to infect more than 8,000 databases as of Friday morning. Since then, companies and individuals have been reaching out for help, but the problem might get worse as copycats start cropping up. ""I am happy people are reaching out,"" Gevers said.

2016-12-28 00:00:00,2016,12.0,28,How drugs can lead to early death," (CNN)Can drug use contribute to a person's earlier-than-expected death, even if they stopped using long ago? Undoubtedly, yes.  Although each drug causes unique physiological and neurological effects, all drugs overlap in one important way, said Dr. Scott Krakower, assistant unit chief for psychiatry at Zucker Hillside Hospital, New Hyde Park in New York. All drugs cause changes in the brain, some in ways that may be long-lasting or even permanent.  These brain changes can have significant effects on mood and cause depression, ultimately lessening a person's ability to lead their best and healthiest life. Or, as the website of the National Institute on Drug Abuse describes: Once addicted, the brain is literally changed. Your brain regulates all the body's basic functions, including every breath and each heartbeat, while enabling you to interpret and respond to experience. It shapes thoughts and emotions and determines your behavior.  Despite some commonality, the short- and long-term health effects of drugs are distinct, with each one potentially affecting life spans in a different way.  Opioids Opioids include heroin and prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine, morphine and fentanyl. All members of the same chemical family, these drugs interact with the opioid receptors on nerve cells in both the body and the brain.  Though opioids bring a reduction in pain, these drugs also cause changes in your blood pressure, in terms of lowering it acutely, and can bring changes in heart rhythm. An opioid user's blood pressure can drop suddenly and significantly, ""and that can lead to a stroke,"" said Dr. Robin Dharia, a vascular neurologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. She added that opiates affect breathing and oxygenation of blood. With overdoses, users have difficulty breathing, which can be deadly. In the long term, ""opiates can have a lot of effects on the body. Most commonly, we think of problems with bowel function,"" Dharia said. Nausea and vomiting are common among users, while some have trouble going to the bathroom. If this constipation becomes severe enough, it can lead to an intestinal rupture, she said. ""Opiates can also cause problems with the endocrine system -- your hormone system,"" Dharia said, which can lead to problems with sexual function, fertility and reduced testosterone levels in men. Bone disorders may also be a result of chronic use. ""Chronic use can cause slowing of the electrical activity in the brain,"" Dharia said, explaining that because opiates depress the central nervous system, they can cause sleep-wake cycle changes, mood changes, cognitive issues and even cognitive decline. ""We see seizures after abrupt changes in opiate use,"" Dharia said.  Cocaine Physiologically, cocaine reduces blood flow in the gastrointestinal tract, which can lead to tears and ulcerations. Chronic cocaine users often lose their appetite and may become malnourished. Cocaine also has well-recognized negative effects on the heart and cardiovascular system.  This drug can ""damage and destroy the walls of the heart,"" Dharia said, and it can affect the coronary arteries. ""Even in young people without the typical risk factors, it can narrow the arteries in the heart,"" she added. Chest pains resembling a heart attack send many users to the ER. Meanwhile, long-term medical consequences include cardiac conditions, such as deterioration of the heart's ability to contract, and aortic ruptures as well as neurological impairment, said Krakower.  Bleeding in the brain and bulges in the walls of blood vessels in the brain also accompany long-term cocaine use.  ""You can get a stroke after your first try or years of use,"" Dharia said, adding that cocaine causes ""quite a bit of damage to the arteries in the brain,"" which sometimes causes seizures. Movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease, may also occur after many years of use. Meanwhile, in the brain, the reward pathway becomes less sensitive, while brain circuits involved in stress become increasingly sensitive. ""Because you have this dramatic change in dopamine, you might not be able to feel ... sensation or pleasure,"" Krakower said. ""Long-term effects from cocaine include interference within the glutamate system and prefrontal cortex.""  The result of these brain changes means regular cocaine users are more likely to want, seek and use the drug instead of focusing on relationships, food or other natural rewards. ""The idea is, you can get this lack of motivation and sort of blah feeling and not have the same, let's say, reaction to things -- even libido,"" Krakower said. Cocaine worsens memory, according to Krakower. In addition, studies suggest that long-term cocaine use harms a range of cognitive functions, including making decisions, performing motor tasks, sustaining attention and inhibiting impulses.  Marijuana and hallucinogens Marijuana is the ""most commonly used illicit drug in the United States,"" the National Institute on Drug Abuse says. Weed produces euphoria, yet it also impairs the judgment of users, motor coordination and reaction times. Short-term, cannabis increases the heart rate, even doubling it in some cases. Sudden rapid beating poses a cardiac danger to anyone with a pre-existing heart condition. Marijuana contains toxic gases and particles that can harm the lungs. Routine smoking is linked to airway inflammation and increased symptoms of chronic bronchitis. Regular users have a greater likelihood of respiratory infections, including pneumonia. A few studies have shown that marijuana use in the teen years is associated with an increased risk for an aggressive form of testicular cancer. National Institute on Drug Abuse researchers say early onset of this cancer indicates that just a few years of use may be harmful. Different still are hallucinogens, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), or acid; mescaline and peyote; psilocybin, or ""magic mushrooms""; and phencyclidine (PCP), or angel dust.  Generally, hallucinogens distort a user's perception of reality, direction, distance and time. Some have effects lasting up to 12 hours. Disoriented, users can become unpredictable, erratic and violent, which can lead to serious injury or even death.  With LSD, in particular, repeat users develop a tolerance, so they tend to take higher and higher doses to achieve the same psychedelic effects. Large doses of LSD are more likely to cause convulsions, coma, heart and lung failure, or death. Counteracting the harm done If you've used drugs, you might want to take certain countermeasures. The first one is quitting. ""Though you have used them or tried them in the past, the idea is that if you stop, while some things may be permanent -- the idea is hopefully, our bodies can learn to compensate and move forward the best it can,"" Krakower said. ""Therefore, you want to try and stop earlier rather than later."" Dharia agrees: ""Quitting is the first step.""  After that, she said, former drug users need to make sure they see their primary care physicians on a regular basis and ""be honest"" about their history, because ""any physician will understand the potential long-term effects of those drugs and what to screen for."" Along with routine doctor visits, former drug users need to exercise regularly, never smoke, avoid excessive alcohol, watch their sugar and eat healthy, said Dharia: ""That's everything you can do afterward.""

2018-06-07 00:00:00,2018,6.0,7,Facebook bug made private posts of 14 million users public,"About 14 million Facebook users who thought they were posting a message just to friends or smaller groups may have actually been sharing it widely with the general public due to a software bug, the company said Thursday. A Facebook user's post typically defaults to a preselected privacy setting. However, a bug that was active from May 18 to May 27 changed posts to automatically be public. The posts were clearly marked as public, but users who were used to their privacy settings could have easily overlooked the public designation. The company said it went back and recategorized the affected posts to the user's default setting before the bug, and the problem has been fixed. In addition, Facebook will notify the 14 million users who could have been affected starting Thursday with an alert in their notifications. ""Starting today we are letting everyone affected know and asking them to review any posts they made during that time,"" chief privacy officer Erin Egan said in a statement. ""We'd like to apologize for this mistake, "" Egan said. It's another misstep in Facebook's ongoing data privacy issues, spurred by revelations of a data leak that affected as many as 87 million users. The issue resulted from Facebook's efforts to allow users to highlight items on their profiles, such as photos, the company said. The featured items defaulted to public settings, which inadvertently made all posts by the user during the affected time period also default to public. — CNBC's Michelle Castillo contributed to this report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/07/facebook-bug-made-private-posts-of-up-to-14-million-users-public.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,253
2017-03-28 00:00:00,2017,3.0,28,AI to become main way banks interact with customers,"Artificial intelligence (AI) will become the primary way banks interact with their customers within the next three years, according to three quarters of bankers surveyed by consultancy Accenture <ACN.N> in a new report. Four in five bankers believe AI will ""revolutionize"" the way in which banks gather information as well as how they interact with their clients, said the Accenture Banking Technology Vision 2017 report, which surveyed more than 600 top bankers and also consulted tech industry experts and academics. Artificial intelligence -- the technology behind driverless cars, drones and voice-recognition software -- is seen by the financial world as a key technology which, along with other ""fintech"" innovations such as blockchain, will change the face of banking in the coming years. More than three quarters of respondents to the survey believed that AI would enable more simple user interfaces, which would help banks create a more human-like customer experience. ""The big paradox here is that people think technology will lead to banking becoming more and more automated and less and less personalized, but what we've seen coming through here is the view that technology will actually help banking become a lot more personalized,"" said Alan McIntyre, head of the Accenture's banking practice and co-author of the report. ""(It) will give people the impression that the bank knows them a lot better, and in many ways it will take banking back to the feeling that people had when there were more human interactions."" The top reason for using AI for user interfaces, cited by 60 percent of the bankers surveyed, was ""to gain data analysis and insights."" But worries over the privacy of data were cited as the top challenge, with one in three also saying that the fact users often prefer human interactions could also be a problem. The report also found that, while the number of human interactions in bank branches or over the phone was falling and would continue to do so, the quality and importance of human contact would increase. ""What you're going to get on the bankers' side is access to far better information, and that's going to allow them to understand what your needs are and what the advice is that they need to give you,"" said McIntyre. Banks' advisory arms are an area considered one of the ripest for technological innovation. ""The advisory business of banking is a very costly model, and artificial intelligence can help to manage the data and to scale the advisory model in a way that was unforeseeable before,"" said Roberto Mancone, Deutsche Bank's global head of disruptive technologies and solutions.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/28/ai-to-become-main-way-banks-interact-with-customers.html,Tech,CNBC,technology,432
2016-10-29 11:55:00,2016,10.0,29,What Happens When You Fire an AK-47 at an iPad? An Artist Investigates," An iPad is designed with durability, and while accidents happen, firing an AK47 at its screen doesn’t fall under Apple’s warranty program. Dutch artist Dani Ploeger went to Poland in February 2016 to do just that. “I fired an AK47 at a working iPad,” Ploeger tells The Creators Project. “I filmed the impact of the bullet on the screen with a high frame rate camera and recorded the sound. I play back this footage on a working iPad.” Ploeger explains this at the Variation Media Art Fair in Paris, where his work, titled Assault, was exhibited and put on sale. The working iPad he mentions hangs on the wall, playing the video so that it appears that the device gets shot with a bullet—somewhat shockingly—creating the appearance of a hole, the source of cracks that are now fictitiously spreading throughout the glass. The footage then gets played back slowly so that smoke is seen going through the original bullet hole, which at the end of the reel is shown closing up, the glass mended. The sound follows the same interchangeable process. ""It’s an endless process of this iPad showing its own destruction and regeneration,” says Ploeger. Next to the iPad hangs a plastic bag with a bullet and empty 7.62x39mm cartridge inside. This project was the first time that Ploeger had shot the notorious Russian-made weapon but narratives of technology and its cultural impact play a significant role within much of his work. Assault was inspired through a search for methods of warfare, something that might echo the physicality of trench warfare of WWI and WWII. “I think in a way violence has become detached from a sense of reality,” says Ploeger. “It’s the kind of Tarantino violence, it’s violent but it doesn’t really relate to hurting people.” Most notably since the Gulf Wars, military technology has advanced substantially, bringing today’s reality of war to one allegedly without any collateral damage through the use of weapons like drones or GPS-controlled missiles. With these tools, the notion of violence becomes more associated with a violent video game or film, rather than loss of human life or the destruction of homes and livelihoods. Ploeger went to “the end of Europe,"" he says, on his search for the location that would illustrate the rawness of violence, paired with modern-day technical advancements. In Eastern Ukraine he saw it, traveling by a train that use to lead from Kiev to Donetsk, now 10km from the frontline of the Donetsk People's Republic. Fully equipped with WiFi, the train held other passengers,  too—uniformed soldiers, playing on their tablets and mobiles while on their way to an artillery range.  “So this piece [Assault] kind of clashes those two things, the sort of primitive violence of the Kalashnikov gun, and the sophistication of the high-tech digital device,” says Ploeger. “On one hand, it’s a representation of a violent act,” says Ploeger. “On the other hand, it totally aestheticizes it. So the piece is also an encapsulation, maybe the extension, of Hollywood cinema but with a material realness to it.” Assault is only the starting point in Ploeger’s exploration into war, culture and their changing definitions, so make sure to keep up with his work here.

2020-01-21 00:00:00,2020,1.0,21,IBM forecasts full-year profit above estimates on cloud growth,"(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) forecast full-year profit above market expectations on Tuesday after reporting surprise growth in quarterly revenue, boosted by its high-margin cloud computing business, sending its shares up more than 4%. Over the past few years, Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty has been trying to shift the company’s focus to the cloud through acquisitions and also by selling some of IBM’s legacy businesses. IBM bought Linux maker Red Hat Inc in a $34 billion deal last year, its biggest acquisition so far, in a push to expand its subscription-based software business. Revenue from the cloud business rose 21% to $6.8 billion in the fourth quarter, its largest so far. The company forecast an adjusted profit of at least $13.35 per share for the year, compared with estimate of $13.29. IBM reported adjusted gross profit margin of nearly 52% for the quarter, a rise of 230 basis points, which was its largest in more than 10 years. The company had changed its reporting structure last year – its two biggest segments now are cloud and cognitive software, and global technology services. Revenue from the cloud and cognitive software segment, which includes Red Hat, rose 8.7% to $7.2 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. IBM has said that it would report only a portion of Red Hat’s actual revenue for some quarters, while recording all its expenses as required by U.S. accounting standards. The global technology services segment, which caters to some of the world’s largest data centers, reported $6.9 billion of revenue, down 4.8% from the previous year. IBM recorded a marginal increase of 0.1% in overall revenue to $21.78 billion in the quarter, its first rise in six quarters. Analysts on average had expected a drop of nearly 1%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Rometty said IBM is positioned for sustained revenue growth in 2020. Excluding special items, it earned $4.71 per share, above analysts’ expectation of $4.69.

This year, the Washington Post reports, at least two groups are exploring a bid against UNOS—the first time the organization has faced a challenge in well over a decade.There are a few fairly sizable obstacles, however. The US government released its solicitation for bids on March 30, giving challengers just 35 days to put together a plan for how to manage a network of more than 800 transplant programs. And bidders are required to have three years of experience managing transplant projects of similar complexity—criteria that’s hard to meet unless you’re UNOS.Who winds up with the contract, though, could make a big impact for those on the organ transplant list. At present, there are 114,894 people on the transplant list, according to UNOS. An average of 22 people on the waiting lists die each day.The shortage has led to a race to figure out how to effectively and efficiently grow replacement organs in a lab. Others have experimented with ways to incentivize more people to donate non-vital organs, like kidneys. But it’s possible that managing the existing transplant system more efficiently could also save a lot of lives.[The Washington Post]",https://gizmodo.com/the-organization-that-has-run-america-s-organ-transplan-1825543106,Health,Gizmodo,health,278
2019-07-21 00:00:00,2019,7.0,21,Trump administration pauses new rule limiting abortion referrals: report,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration will pause its enforcement of a new rule barring federally funded family planning clinics from referring women for abortions, the Washington Post reported late on Saturday. The rule had been announced last Monday, when officials said it would take immediate effect. The reversal was announced on Saturday evening by U.S. Health and Human Services Department officials, who informed clinics that they would now have two months to comply before facing penalties, the Post reported. Trump, who says he opposes abortions in most cases, has joined many of his fellow Republicans in seeking to curtail access to legal abortions. Many doctors and rights groups are fighting these efforts as harmful to women’s health and in breach of a constitutional right to abortion. A federal appeals court cleared the way for the move earlier this year, ruling that the administration could cut off Title X subsidies of reproductive healthcare and family planning costs for low-income women at clinics that refer patients to abortion providers. The rule was intended to help Trump fulfill his 2016 campaign pledge to end federal support for Planned Parenthood, a non-profit group that runs about 600 healthcare clinics around the country and receives an estimated one-fifth of all Title X funds. Planned Parenthood has condemned the rule, saying it silences doctors and nurses and would harm their patients’ health. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, said this week that his state would defy the rule by refusing all Title X funding from the federal government, replacing those funds with state money.

The service, currently available to Amazon’s Prime Now customers in Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and parts of London, will be rolled out to Glasgow, Newcastle, Liverpool, Sheffield and Portsmouth this year, the companies said on Thursday.  It allows Amazon Prime customers to order a full Morrisons shop online, which is then picked at a local store, and delivered by Amazon, with an option for delivery within one hour of the order being placed in some locations.   The service will be expanded to more British cities in future, the companies said.  Morrisons, Britain’s fourth-biggest supermarket group behind Walmart’s Asda, Sainsbury’s and market leader Tesco, also provides food in a wholesale deal for Amazon’s “Fresh” and “Pantry” grocery offers.  The U.S. online giant has gradually extended its food offer in Britain, but according to market researchers Kantar Worldpanel, its market share is still less than 1%.  Shares in Morrisons were up 1.5%, outperforming a weak sector after a trading update from Tesco showed sales growth slowing. Tesco’s shares were down 2%, while Sainsbury’s was down 0.5%.  Jefferies analyst James Grzinic said that, given the urban skew of Prime Now customers, the tie-up would provide an opportunity for Morrisons to increase sales in parts of Britain where it is under-represented.

They're not cheap to build and maintain, and still challenge aircraft engineers to find ways to launch and land a plane over short distances.  What if there was a better way? SideArm is a joint project from the US Office of Naval Research and the Defense Advanced Research Projects agency aka DARPA. The system is designed to launch a one-ton unmanned airplane from a spot the size of a 20-foot shipping container. Two or four people can set it up to launch in minutes, the defense research company explains in a news release. In the first test, the aft hook grabs a 400 pound test aircraft, leads it along a rail overhead, and flings it nose-up toward the ceiling, into a waiting net. DARPA demonstrates using computerized scenarios how this would look on a ground-based launch and a launch from a carrier, both with the aircraft flying free from the catapult arm and returning to be captured by a net along the same rail. Since this test to scale exceeded their expectations by a couple hundred pounds, the team plans to up the weight bearing to 1,320 pounds, for extra-hefty military drones. It's still early days for the system, but based on the results so far, it doesn't seem like it will be long before this drone catcher enters the big leagues.  Get six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter .",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/eza5jw/darpa-and-the-navy-are-working-on-a-giant-drone-catcher,Tech by VICE,Vice,technology,253

We don’t know what it is, exactly, but it’s a new video game set in the  Fallout universe using the  Fallout 4 engine. This would follow the pattern it established last generation when it released  Fallout 3 followed by  Fallout: New Vegas, another full game that used the same engine but not a full a numbered sequel.   In the teaser, the camera moves over footage of a vault seemingly abandoned after a celebration. There’s Americana everywhere and someone is singing John Denver’s  Take Me Home, Country Roads. A man on television talks about rebuilding the wastes. A sign indicates they vault-dwellers were celebrating something called reclamation day. My guess is that this is the day the first generation of vault dwellers—the people who survived the nuclear war that ended the world—step out of the vault for the first time.   In the  Fallout timeline, the bombs fell in 2077, and a Vault-Tec poster in the trailer salutes America’s 300th anniversary, from 1776 to 2076.  It sounds like the people of Vault 76 were taught it was their duty to resettle the wastes, which could be an interesting premise.

2019-02-14 00:00:00,2019,2.0,14,Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller placed bet against Tesla during Q4,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller bet against electric carmaker Tesla Inc during the fourth quarter, wagering that its share price will fall, according to quarterly filings released on Thursday. Druckenmiller’s family fund, which shares the name of the hedge fund Duquesne Capital that he founded in 1981, bought put options on Tesla shares worth $99.8 million, a Security and Exchange Commission filing revealed. The option contract allows the fund to sell the shares at a set price before a set time, implying Druckenmiller believes Tesla’s share price will fall before the contract expires. Neither the strike price nor the maturity of the contract is public. Tesla’s shares have fallen 6.61 percent since the start of the year after a volatile 2018 in which its price vacillated within a $134 range. Tesla has $920 million in convertible debt coming due on March 1, which is expected to put pressure on the company, which has previously struggled to maintain a positive cash flow. Convertible issues give bondholders the right to trade their debt for equity after shares rise over a certain price. Tesla shares are currently more than $50 below the $359.87 conversion price after closing on Thursday at $303.77. Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers’ stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are one of the few public ways of tracking what the managers are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures come 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions. (This story refiles to add “within a range” in paragraph four to clarify that $134 is the amount of change in the share price.)

Titanium dioxide is widely used in industry as a whitener, notably for paint, and in the food sector, where it is labeled E171 and goes into products from chocolate to chewing gum. France had ordered a review of the substance in 2017 after a study found health effects in animals that consumed it. France’s National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) and partners in a study of oral exposure to titanium dioxide had shown that E171 crosses the intestine wall in animals to reach other parts of the body. Asked to do a wider review into the ingredient, health and safety agency ANSES found there was not enough evidence to prove it was safe for humans, the French economy and environment ministries said in a joint statement on Wednesday. “ANSES stresses in its opinion that the evaluation of the risks related to the use of this additive still suffers from a lack of data that the marketers and producers of this additive should have provided,” they said. “In particular, no acceptable daily intake could be established for this additive due to lack of data.” E171 is authorized at European Union level and the French government said it would notify the European Commission and other member states of its decision.

2020-02-18 00:00:00,2020,2.0,18,"US ranks lower than 38 other countries when it comes to children 'flourishing,' report says"," (CNN)The United States ranks lower than 38 other countries on measurements of children's survival, health, education and nutrition -- and every country in the world has levels of excess carbon emissions that will prevent younger generations from a healthy and sustainable future, according to a new report. The report, published in the medical journal The Lancet on Tuesday, ranked 180 countries based on a ""child flourishing index"" and the United States came in at No. 39. Countries also were ranked by levels of excess carbon emissions -- specifically researchers took a close look at estimated levels for 2030. Based on that data, the United States ranked No. 173 for sustainability, according to the report. The year 2030 was selected as the threshold because in 2015 governments around the world adopted ""Sustainable Development Goals"" created by the United Nations to make improvements for people and the planet by 2030. When contrasting the child flourishing rankings with the carbon emissions rankings, the countries among the top for children ""flourishing"" were shown to have some of the most concerning levels of excess carbon emissions predicted for the future, according to the report, which was conducted by a commission of the World Health Organization, United Nations Children's Fund and the Lancet. ""No country is in the right place with adequately making children flourish today and in the future,"" said Dr. Stefan Peterson, chief of health at UNICEF and an independent author of the report. Norway, South Korea and the Netherlands ranked in the top three, respectively, on current child ""flourishing,"" but those countries were 156th, 166th and 160th, respectively, on the global sustainability index that measured carbon emissions, according to the report. Some countries had lower, yet still high, excess carbon emissions levels, but those countries did not rank well on the ""child flourishing index"" in the report. For instance, Burundi, Chad and Somalia ranked first, second and third on the sustainability rankings but 156th, 179th and 178th, respectively, on the ""flourishing"" rankings. ""I was hoping and thinking that at least some countries somewhere must be doing the right thing for children now and the right thing for children in the future -- but I saw no country was in that ideal place and that quite surprised me,"" Peterson said. The ""child flourishing index"" was developed specifically for the new report, Peterson said. The index was based on an aggregation of country-by-country data on various factors to measure child flourishing, including child survival rates, years of school, teen birth rates, maternal mortality, prevalence of violence, growth and nutrition, among other factors.  ""We looked at what extent children are able to fulfill their potential,"" Peterson said. ""It's about knowledge, growth, going to school and learning and it's about being protected from violence. We tried to look holistically."" Most of the data used came from previous research, including some UNICEF resources. Overall, the report found that the top 10 rankings on the child flourishing index were the countries of: Norway, ranked first overallSouth KoreaNetherlandsFranceIrelandDenmarkJapanBelgiumIcelandUnited Kingdom The United States ranked as No. 39. The bottom 10 rankings on the child flourishing index, according to the report were: Central African Republic, ranked last overall at No. 180ChadSomaliaNigerMaliGuineaNigeriaSouth SudanSierra LeoneAfghanistan When it came to measurements of sustainability, the report found that the top 10 rankings were the countries of: Burundi, ranked first overallChadSomaliaDemocratic Republic of the CongoCentral African RepublicMalawiRwandaMaliNigerMadagascar The bottom 10 rankings on sustainability were: Qatar, ranked last overallTrinidad and TobagoKuwaitUnited Arab EmiratesBahrainSaudi ArabiaAustraliaUnited StatesKazakhstanLuxembourg To improve outcomes among children, the report calls for countries to stop excessive carbon emissions; tighten regulations around commercial marketing of junk food, alcohol and other harmful products; introduce new policies to protect children's health, nutrition and rights; and incorporate children's voices into policy decisions, among other recommendations. ""This report shows that the world's decision makers are, too often, failing today's children and youth: failing to protect their health, failing to protect their rights, and failing to protect their planet,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a written statement about the release of the report.  ""This must be a wakeup call for countries to invest in child health and development, ensure their voices are heard, protect their rights, and build a future that is fit for children.""
